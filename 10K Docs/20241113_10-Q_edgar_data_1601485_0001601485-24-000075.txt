 million shares of the Company s common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, with Former Elicio equity holders collectively owning approximately of the Company and Angion equity holders collectively owning approximately of the Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis. 
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Former Elicio being treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. See discussions of the transactions in connection with the Merger at Note 3 - Merger and Related Transactions. 
 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects that its operating losses and negative operating cash flows will continue for the foreseeable future as the Company continues to develop its product candidates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company s losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and accumulated deficit, as well as the additional capital needed to fund operations for at least twelve months following the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development of its product candidates and will require additional financing to continue this development. The Company plans to address this condition through the sale of Company common stock or other securities in public offerings and/or private placements, debt financings, or through other capital sources, including licensing arrangements, partnerships and collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions, but there is no assurance these plans will be completed successfully or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital when and as needed to continue as a going concern, it might have to further reduce or scale back its operations and/or liquidate its assets, and the values it receives for its assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in its financial statements. 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 2 
 Since Former Elicio was determined to be the accounting acquirer in connection with the Merger, for periods prior to the Merger, the condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis for Former Elicio and did not include the combined entities activity or financial position. Subsequent to the Merger, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the acquired business and assets and liabilities at their acquisition date fair value. Historical share and per share figures of Former Elicio have been retroactively restated to reflect the impact of the reverse stock split of Angion s common stock, par value per share Angion common stock ), at a ratio of 10:1 (the Reverse Stock Split completed in connection with and prior to the closing of the Merger, based on the exchange ratio of (the Exchange Ratio ). 
 Financial Statement Correction 
 In the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incorrectly included the Weighted Average Shares Outstanding WASO number from the calculation for diluted Earnings Per Share EPS in its basic EPS calculation. This resulted in an overstatement of WASO and corresponding understatement of EPS. The Company evaluated this error during the period ended December 31, 2023, when it was first discovered to determine the materiality and if it would require a restatement. Based on the Company s analysis, the error was not material enough to warrant a restatement and will be corrected on a prospective basis in future periods. This has been corrected in the reported prior period amounts disclosed in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.)

 of of the initial members of the board of directors of the combined company; (iii) Former Elicio s executive management team became the management team of the combined company; and (iv) the Company was named Elicio Therapeutics, Inc. and is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of Former Elicio issuing stock to acquire the net assets of Angion. As a result of the Merger, the net assets of Angion were recorded at their acquisition-date fair value, which approximated book value due to the short-term nature of the instruments, in the financial statements of Former Elicio and the reported operating results prior to the Merger were those of Former Elicio. Historical common share amounts of Former Elicio have been retroactively restated based on the Exchange Ratio. It was concluded that any in-process research and development assets that remained as of the Merger would be de minimis when compared to the cash and investments obtained through the Merger.

shares of Angion common stock, which resulted in the issuance by Angion of an aggregate of shares of Angion common stock to the stockholders of Former Elicio (the Exchange Shares ), and a total of shares of the Company common stock being issued and outstanding immediately following the effective time of the Merger. In addition, Angion assumed the Former Elicio 2022 Equity Incentive Plan and the Former Elicio 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the Former Elicio Plans and each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Former Elicio common stock and each outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase Former Elicio capital stock were adjusted with such stock options and warrants henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Former Elicio common stock previously represented by such options and warrants, at an exercise price equal to the exercise price of Former Elicio capital stock divided by the Exchange Ratio. 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Angion made a bridge loan to Former Elicio pursuant to a note purchase agreement and promissory notes up to an aggregate principal amount of million, issued with a original issue discount, with an initial closing held substantially concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement for a principal amount of million in exchange for cash of million and an additional closing for a principal amount of million in exchange for cash of million upon delivery by Former Elicio to Angion of Former Elicio s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Bridge Loan ). 
 Other current assets Promissory notes, net Accrued liabilities ) Net assets acquired 

Per the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon completion of the Merger, all obligations owed by Former Elicio related to the Bridge Loan were automatically forgiven and the amount advanced by Angion, along with any accrued and unpaid interest, was credited towards the net cash balance used to calculate the assets and liabilities listed above. Upon settlement of the Bridge Loan, the Company recognized a gain of million related to the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the Bridge Loan. 
 
 The Company recognized the net assets acquired, excluding the promissory notes and transaction costs of million, as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated statements of convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity (deficit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) Included in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. This balance includes cash requirements settled on a nightly basis. 
 Cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were held in U.S. Treasury securities. 
 There were no transfers made among the three levels in the fair value hierarchy during the periods presented. 
 As part of the Merger transaction, Former Elicio assumed Angion s warrant liabilities. The fair value of the assumed Angion warrants was classified as Level 3 with key Level 3 inputs of exercise price, term, and volatility. 
 Existing Angion warrant liability Change in fair value ) Balance, end of the period 
 Both observable and unobservable inputs were used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category. Unrealized gains and losses associated with assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities) inputs. 
 The fair value of the Angion warrants issued by the Company has been estimated using Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying equity included in Black-Scholes was valued based on the equity value implied from sales of preferred and common stock at each measurement date, as applicable. The fair value of the warrants was impacted by the model selected as well as assumptions surrounding unobservable inputs including the underlying equity value, expected volatility of the underlying equity, risk free interest rate, and the expected term. 
 In March 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the March Subscription Agreement with GKCC, LLC, an entity controlled by a member of the Company s board of directors GKCC ), providing for the issuance and sale by the Company to GKCC of pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock, at a purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant of (the March Offering ). The Company identified these warrants as liabilities and measured them at fair value on March 19, 2024, and subsequently remeasures the fair value of these warrant liabilities on a quarterly basis.

million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately years. 
 Stock-based Compensation Expense 
 General and administrative Total 
 
 The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the assumptions noted in the table below. The fair value of an award with only a service condition is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost of awards that contain a performance condition are recognized when success is considered probable during the performance period. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. The risk-free interest rate is estimated using the weighted average rate of return on U.S. Treasury notes with a life that approximates the expected life of the option. The expected term of options granted to employees was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The Company uses the simplified method because it does not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The contractual life of the option was used for the expected life of options granted to non-employees. Expected volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies, using the daily closing prices during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of stock-based awards. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of the Company s stock price becomes available, or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer comparable companies. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company's expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our audited financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 29, 2024, as amended (the Form 10-K ). In addition to the historical financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, forecasts and projections. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q titled Risk Factors and the Form 10-K, which you should read carefully to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of immunotherapies for patients with limited treatment options and poor outcomes suffering from cancer and infectious disease. Our proprietary Amphiphile AMP technology is designed to mobilize the body s immune response by preferentially targeting our product candidates to the lymph nodes with the goal of generating a robust T cell response. Recent advances have identified T cell responses as a key component of effective cancer immunotherapy and we believe our AMP technology can generate a robust T cell response that can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefit. 
 We believe the therapeutic utility of currently approved and development stage immunotherapies are limited in many cases due to their inability to sufficiently localize to lymph nodes and adequately engage with the critical immune cells responsible for stimulating adaptive immunity. Our AMP technology is specifically intended to localize payloads to lymph nodes leading to the generation of a robust T cell response that we believe is critical to generate an anticancer immune response. 
 Our lead programs focus on our cancer vaccine product candidates, which target biologically validated tumor mutation drivers using known neoantigens. This strategy results in an off-the-shelf therapeutic option allowing patients to receive treatment without delay due to manufacturing timelines and costs associated with personalized vaccine approaches. 
 Our clinical and preclinical pipeline includes the lymph node targeted therapeutic cancer vaccines ELI-002, currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical program, designed to stimulate an immune response against mutant KRAS cancers, ELI-007, currently being evaluated in a preclinical study for the treatment of mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 BRAF )-driven cancers, and ELI-008, currently being evaluated in a preclinical study for use in the treatment of mutated tumor protein p53 TP53 expressing cancers. We believe that each of our immunotherapy product candidates, if approved, have the potential to improve the lives of patients suffering from solid tumors arising due to specific oncogenic driver mutations. 
 Our operations to date have been financed primarily by aggregate net proceeds of 182.7 million from the issuance of common stock, pre-funded warrants, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, the exercise of stock options and common stock warrants, the private placement of our securities, at-the-market offerings, and proceeds from the Merger. Since inception, we have had significant annual operating losses. Our net loss was 18.8 million and 37.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 10.7 million and 26.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 180.1 million and 26.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Elicio Operating Company, Inc. Former Elicio was incorporated in Delaware as Vedantra Pharmaceuticals Inc. in August 2011. In December 2018, Former Elicio formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Elicio Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation. 
 On January 17, 2023, Former Elicio entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement with Angion Biomedica Corp Angion ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company, and Arkham Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Angion Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Former Elicio, with Former Elicio surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Angion (the Merger ). Following the Merger, Former Elicio and Elicio Australia Pty Ltd. Elicio Pty ), an Australian subsidiary established in August 2019 for the purpose of qualifying for research credits for studies conducted in Australia, became our wholly owned subsidiaries.

 On June 1, 2023, the Merger was completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and Angion changed its name from Angion Biomedica Corp. to Elicio Therapeutics, Inc. Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, there were approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, with Former Elicio equity holders collectively owning approximately 65.2 of the Company and Angion equity holders collectively owning approximately 34.8 of the Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Former Elicio being treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Merger, the net assets of Angion were recorded at their acquisition-date fair value, which approximated book value due to the short-term nature of the instruments, in the financial statements of Former Elicio and the reported operating results prior to the Merger were those of Former Elicio. 
 We are currently facing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, given our cash position and cash runway. As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that our cash on hand will enable us to fund our operations into the second quarter of calendar year 2025 based on our current financial operating plan. This period could be shortened or lengthened if there are any significant increases or decreases in planned or actual spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated. There is no assurance that financing will be available when needed to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and accumulated deficit, as well as the additional capital needed to fund operations for at least twelve months following the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development of our product candidates and will require additional financing to continue this development. We plan to address this condition through the sale of common stock or other securities in public offerings and/or private placements, debt financings, or through other capital sources, including licensing arrangements, partnerships and collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions, but there is no assurance these plans will be completed successfully or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when and as needed to continue as a going concern, we might have to further reduce or scale back our operations and/or liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. In particular, we expect our expenses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, as well as hire additional personnel, pay fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, and incur other increased costs associated with being a public company. In addition, if and when we seek and obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any product candidate, we will also incur increased expenses in connection with commercialization and marketing of any such product. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
 advance our lead product candidate, ELI-002, to late stage clinical trials; 
 advance our preclinical programs to clinical trials; 
 expand our pipeline of product candidates; 
 seek regulatory approval for our investigational medicines; 
 maintain, expand, protect and defend our intellectual property portfolio;

 As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that our cash on hand will enable us to fund our operations into the second quarter of calendar year 2025 based on our current plan. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. To finance our operations beyond that point we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. Our losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and accumulated deficit, as well as the additional capital needed to fund operations for at least twelve months following the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 We have not had any products approved for sale. We do not expect to generate any product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As a result, until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations, licenses or similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies, including our research and development activities. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities to reduce costs. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 The following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our financial statements. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development expenses and general and administrative costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and our drug discovery efforts, which include: 
 personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits, and equity-based compensation expense; 
 expenses incurred under agreements with consultants and contract organizations that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; 
 costs related to sponsored research service agreements; 
 costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; 
 laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical studies and planned clinical trials; and 
 laboratory supplies and equipment used for internal research and development activities. 
 We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and service providers. 
 Our research and development expenses are not currently tracked on a program-by-program basis. We use our personnel and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs directed toward identifying and developing product candidates. Substantially all our research and development costs are incurred on the development of ELI-002 and our preclinical candidates. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, including investments in conducting clinical trials, manufacturing and otherwise advancing our programs. The process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be needed to complete the development of, or the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows may commence from ELI-002 or any of our preclinical candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities; 
 clinical trials and early-stage results; 
 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; and 
 the ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for ELI-002, or any of our preclinical candidates that we or our future collaboration partners may develop in the future. 
 Any of these variables with respect to the development of ELI-002, or any other of our preclinical candidates that we may develop could result in a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of such candidates. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct preclinical and clinical studies beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of our clinical development programs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including equity-based compensation, and other expenses for outside professional services, including marketing, legal, audit and accounting, and facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, and recruiting. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years to support our continued research and development activities, manufacturing activities, increased costs of expanding our operations and operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increases related to the hiring of additional personnel and legal, regulatory and other fees and services associated with maintaining compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, or the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and Securities and Exchange Commission SEC requirements, accounting and audit fees, director and officer insurance costs and investor relations costs associated with being a public company. 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income and expense consisted primarily of interest income, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, gain on sale of equipment, interest expense, gain on extinguishment of the promissory note payable, and gains and losses related to the re-measurement of our warrant liabilities.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.1 million was primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses resulting from the wind down of the ELI-002 Phase 1 trials. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 General and administrative expenses were 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in external costs related to the Merger. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 Other (expense) income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was expense of 8.5 million compared to income of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 8.6 million was primarily due to the change in fair value and loss on issuance associated with the pre-funded warrants and common warrants as defined in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5.3 million was primarily due to an increase in external costs associated with ELI-002 manufacturing and clinical trials. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in external costs related to the Merger. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was expense of 6.4 million compared to income of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 6.5 million was primarily due to the change in fair value and loss on issuance associated with the pre-funded warrants and common warrants. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Our operations through September 30, 2024 have been financed primarily by aggregate net proceeds of 182.7 million from the issuance of common stock, pre-funded warrants, convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, the exercise of stock options and common stock warrants, the private placement of our securities, at-the-market offerings, and proceeds from the Merger. Since inception, we have had significant operating losses. Our net 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 loss was 37.9 million and 26.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 180.1 million and 26.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Our losses from operations, negative operating cash flows and accumulated deficit, as well as the additional capital needed to fund operations for at least twelve months following the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development of our product candidates and will require additional financing to continue this development. The condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We plan to address this condition through the sale of common stock or other securities in public offerings and/or private placements, debt financings, or through other capital sources, including licensing arrangements, partnerships and collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Should we be unable to raise this amount of capital our operating plans will be limited to the amount of capital that we can access. We may also consider steps to reduce our operating expenses. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of the foregoing. 
 Summary Statement of Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth a summary of our net cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in)

 42,094 31,612 Effect of foreign currency on cash 
 (5) Net increase in cash 
 13,726 8,781 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 28.3 million, which consisted of a net loss of 37.9 million, changes in our assets and liabilities of 0.3 million, and non-cash charges of 9.3 million. The non-cash charges were related to 3.5 million loss on the issuance of the pre-funded warrants and common warrants, 3.3 million of change in the fair value of warrant liability, 1.0 million of stock-based compensation, 0.6 million amortization of the right of use asset, 0.5 million related to issuance costs for the pre-funded warrants and common warrants, 0.1 million of non-cash interest expense, and 0.2 million of depreciation. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 22.8 million, which primarily consisted of a net loss of 26.2 million, which was partially offset by the change in net operating assets and liabilities of 1.6 million and net non-cash charges of 1.9 million. The cash provided by the change in net operating assets and liabilities was due to a 0.2 million increase in deferred research obligation, a 2.0 million increase in accrued expense and accounts payable, and a 0.6 million decrease in the right of use asset. The net non-cash charges were primarily related to the 1.1 million of interest expense related to promissory notes, 0.8 million of stock-based compensation, 0.3 million of depreciation, partially offset by a 0.6 million of gain on the settlement of the promissory note payable and 0.4 million decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the convertible note.

 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by or used in investing activities was immaterial. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 42.1 million as a result of the issuance of the convertible note for 19.7 million , 10.9 million from the July Public Offering, the issuance of 5.5 million of our common stock under the 2022 ATM and 2024 ATM programs and stock-based compensation exercises, and 6.0 million from the issuance of our pre-funded warrants in a private placement. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 31.6 million, primarily as a result of the Merger Agreement. 
 Future Cash Needs and Funding Requirements 
 Based on our current operating plan, as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second quarter of calendar year 2025. However, we have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 the outcome of any future clinical trials, for any existing or future product candidates; 
 whether we are able to take advantage of any FDA expedited development and approval programs for any of our product candidates; 
 the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining and maintaining FDA and any foreign regulatory approvals; 
 the costs associated with any delays we may encounter as a result of evolving regulatory requirements or adverse results with respect to any of our product candidates; 
 the number and characteristics of product candidates we pursue, including product candidates in preclinical development; 
 the ability of our product candidates to progress through clinical development successfully; 
 our need to expand our research and development activities, including to conduct additional clinical trials; 
 market acceptance of our product candidates, including physician adoption, market access, pricing and reimbursement; 
 the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products, product candidates and technologies; 
 our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments potentially required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; 
 our need and ability to hire additional personnel, including management, clinical development, medical and commercial personnel; 
 the effect of competing technological, market developments and government policy; 
 the costs associated with being a public company, including our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; 
 the costs associated with securing and establishing commercialization and manufacturing capabilities, as well as those associated with packaging, warehousing and distribution; 
 the economic and other terms, timing of and success of our existing licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future and timing and amount of payments thereunder; and 
 the timing, receipt and amount of sales and general commercial success of any future approved products, if any. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of common stock or other securities in public offerings and/or private placements, debt financings, or through other capital sources, including licensing arrangements, partnerships and collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through additional collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in the Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in the Form 10-K, other than as set forth in Footnotes 4 and 9, with respect to our accounting policy related to warrants and derivatives. 
 Warrants and Derivatives 
 The Convertible Note, as defined in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included multiple conversion features. We evaluated all conversion features included within the Convertible Note, under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and determined that the default interest feature met the definition of a derivative, but the value was de minimis. 
 The Pre-Funded Warrants, as defined in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, did not meet the equity classification requirements under ASC 815, Derivative and Hedging ; specifically, the Pre-Funded Warrants do not meet the condition of index to its own stock and because the Pre-Funded Warrants were pre-funded and proceeds were received before exercise, these Pre-Funded Warrants do not meet the definition of a derivative. The Pre-Funded Warrants could not be exercised in an amount that would cause the holder to exceed 19.99 beneficial ownership of our shares unless we obtain stockholder approval pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, which limits our ability to issue common stock to settle the Pre-Funded Warrants beyond such 19.99 ownership blocker. Consequently, the Pre-Funded Warrants were classified as liabilities and measured at fair value as of the grant date. Subsequent to the grant date, we remeasured the Pre-Funded Warrants at fair value and recognized a loss from change in fair value of the Pre-Funded Warrants on the condensed consolidated financial statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We will re-assess the liability classification in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The July Common Warrants, as defined in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, did not meet the equity classification requirements under ASC 815, Derivative and Hedging ; specifically, the Common Warrants do not meet the condition of index to its own stock. The Common Warrant contains exercise provisions, in conjunction with the regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, which limit our ability to issue common stock to settle the Common Warrants beyond the 19.99 beneficial ownership limit, unless we obtain stockholder approval. Consequently, the Common Warrants were classified as liabilities and measured at fair value as of grant date. Subsequent to grant date, we remeasured the Common Warrants at fair 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 value and recognized a loss from change in fair value of the Common Warrants on the condensed consolidated financial statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We will re-assess the liability classification in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are a smaller reporting company and an emerging growth company, as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startup JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies include presentation of only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement for an initial public offering, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor's report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended Sarbanes-Oxley ), an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. 
 We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards as of public company effective dates. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2026, (ii) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which means the market value of equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company and/or non-accelerated filer which may allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply for a period of time with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluates these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our President and Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a result of our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except as follows: 
 Material Weakness Remediation Plan 
 As previously reported, in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, we identified control deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 The material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting related to (i) insufficient resources with knowledge and expertise in U.S. GAAP to properly evaluate certain complex transactions, including debt instruments and equity instruments; (ii) insufficient financial reporting and close controls to ensure that incurred expenses are accrued at period end and deliverables from third party contractors are reviewed for accuracy; and (iii) insufficient resources to ensure that calculations used in financial reporting are properly reviewed, including earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding calculations. 
 We initiated several steps to remediate these material weaknesses, including: 
 engaging SEC compliance and technical accounting consultants to assist in evaluating transactions for conformity with U.S. GAAP; 
 hiring additional finance and accounting personnel to augment accounting staff and to provide more resources for complex accounting matters and financial reporting; and 
 strengthening our financial reporting and close relating to incurred expenses by ensuring our data capture procedures are clearly defined and that responsible personnel, including supervisory personnel, have adequate training regarding the process and expectation. 
 Although we have initiated efforts to remediate these material weaknesses, the material weaknesses have not been fully remediated as of September 30, 2024 and continue to be disclosed as material weaknesses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. Our remediation efforts are intended to address the identified material weaknesses. Management is committed to continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in remediating the material weaknesses we identified or that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 
 Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness Over Financial Reporting 
 The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls

 as necessary or appropriate for our business, but there can be no assurance such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings, claims and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities or otherwise. Although the results of the litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of the date of this report, we do not believe we are party to any claim, proceeding or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of any future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could result in substantial costs to us, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors, described in the Form 10-K as well as the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K other than the updates to the risk factors set forth below. 
 
 Our largest stockholder has significant influence over us, including influence over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. 
 
 GKCC, LLC GKCC ), an entity controlled by a member of our board of directors, beneficially owns 19.99 of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, GKCC holds pre-funded warrants to purchase approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock and a convertible note that is convertible into approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock, neither of which are currently convertible into shares of common stock due to a 19.99 beneficial ownership limitation. Although we are not a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, GKCC is able to significantly influence our decisions. Furthermore, should the convertible securities held by GKCC no longer be subject to the 19.99 beneficial ownership limitation and should they be converted into shares of our common stock, GKCC could own an even greater percentage of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, GKCC s interests may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. GKCC may make investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. GKCC may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. 
 
 The terms of our convertible note arrangement with GKCC, an entity controlled by a member of our board of directors, places certain restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business. 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we issued a 3.0 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note due February 15, 2026 (the Convertible Note in the principal amount of 20.0 million (the Note Financing ). The purchaser of the Convertible Note was GKCC. If we raise any additional debt through a financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. These restrictions may include, among other things, limitations on borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the proceeds of such additional debt financing, as well as prohibitions on our ability to incur further debt financing, create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make investments. 
 If we default under the terms of the Convertible Note beyond the applicable grace period, if any, GKCC may declare all amounts outstanding under the Convertible Note to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay the amounts due under the Convertible Note upon GKCC s declaration, GKCC could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure the obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement (including, but not limited to taking control of our pledged assets and foreclosing on other collateral, including those of our subsidiaries, Elicio Operating Company, Inc. and Elicio Securities Corp.). The enforcement by GKCC upon its declaration to accelerate the obligations under the Convertible Note, as mentioned above, could adversely affect our operations. Further, if we are liquidated, GKCC s right to repayment, as well as the right to repayment of other lenders under any additional debt financing, would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock.

At any time following the satisfaction of the Voluntary Conversion Conditions and from time to time, commencing on the Original Issue Date until this Note is no longer outstanding, this Note shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder. The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the Company a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as Annex A (each, a Notice of Conversion ), specifying therein the principal amount of this Note and/or any other amounts due under this Note to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall be effected (such date, the Conversion Date ).

To effect conversions hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless the entire principal amount of this Note, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due under this Note have been so converted. Conversions hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Note in an amount equal to the applicable conversion amount. The Holder and the Company shall maintain a Conversion Schedule showing the principal amount(s) and/or any other amounts due under this Note converted and the date of such conversion(s).

The conversion price in effect on any Conversion Date shall be equal to 5.81, subject to adjustment as set forth herein (the Conversion Price ). All such foregoing determinations will be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the Common Stock during such measuring period. c) Mechanics of Conversion. i. Conversion Shares Issuable Upon a Conversion. The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum of (i) the outstanding principal to be converted as provided in the applicable Notice of Conversion, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (iii) any other amount due under this Note by (y) the Conversion Price. ii. Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion. Not later than two (2) Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder (A) a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares, which, on or after the date on which the resale of such Conversion Shares are covered by and are being sold pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or such Conversion Shares are eligible to be sold under Rule 144 without the need for current public information and the Company has received an opinion of counsel to such effect acceptable to the Company (which opinion the Company will be responsible for obtaining at its own cost) shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those which may then be required by the Purchase Agreement) representing the number of Conversion Shares being acquired or being sold, as the case may be, upon the conversion of this Note, and (B) payment in the amount of accrued and unpaid interest (if the Company has elected to pay accrued interest in cash). All certificate or certificates required to be delivered by the Company under this Section 4(c) shall be delivered electronically through DTC or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions, unless the Company or its Transfer Agent does not have an account with DTC and/or is not participating in the DTC/FAST System, in which case the Company shall 

5 issue and deliver to the address as specified in such Notice of Conversion a certificate (or certificates), registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which the Holder shall be entitled. If the Conversion Shares are not being sold pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or if the Conversion Date is prior to the date on which such Conversion Shares are eligible to be sold under Rule 144 without the need for current public information, the Conversion Shares shall bear a restrictive legend in the following form, as appropriate: THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT. iii. Failure to Deliver Certificates. If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such certificate or certificates are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates, to rescind such Notice of Conversion, in which event the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Note delivered to the Company, and the Holder shall promptly return to the Company the certificate or certificates issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. iv. Obligation Absolute. The Company s obligations to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance that might otherwise limit such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided, however, that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Company of any such action the Company may have against the Holder. v. Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii), and if after such Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(c)(ii). For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall 

6 limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. To the extent a Buy-In occurs as a result of Holder failing to collect shares of Common Stock that were delivered to Holder through DTC in a timely manner, then the Company shall not owe Holder any cash in respect of such Buy-In. vi. Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock at least equal to the Required Minimum (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of this Note and payment of interest on this Note, each as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. vii. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. As to any fraction of a share that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. viii. Transfer Taxes and Expenses. The issuance of certificates for shares of the Common Stock on conversion of this Note shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificates, provided that, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of this Note so converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion. d) Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Note if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue without breaching the Company s obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market. e) Mandatory Conversion. If at any time from and after the date hereof and for so long as the Mandatory Conversion Conditions are satisfied, the closing price of the Common Stock on the Principal Market equals or exceeds 135 of the Conversion Price (which amount may be adjusted for certain capital events, such as stock splits, as described herein) for 20 Trading Days in a 30 Trading Day period (the Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period ), then the Company shall have the right to require the Holder to mandatorily convert all or any portion of the Note, including any accrued but unpaid interest, as designated in the Mandatory Conversion Notice on the Mandatory Conversion Date (each as defined below) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price as of the Mandatory Conversion Date (as defined below) (a Mandatory Conversion). The Company may exercise its right to require conversion under this Section 4(e) by delivering within not more than five (5) Trading Days following the end of such Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period a written notice thereof by electronic mail to the Holder (the Mandatory Conversion Notice and the date that the Holder received such notice is referred to as the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date ). The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. The Mandatory Conversion Notice shall state (I) the Trading Day on which the Mandatory Conversion shall occur, which shall be the second (2nd) Trading Day following the Mandatory Conversion Notice Date (the Mandatory Conversion Date and (II) the aggregate amount of the Note which the Company has elected to be subject to such Mandatory Conversion from the Holder (the Mandatory Conversion Amount pursuant to this Section 4(e). If the Mandatory Conversion Conditions cease to be satisfied during Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period then, at the option of the Holder, the Mandatory Conversion shall be deemed 

7 withdrawn and void ab initio. For clarity, the Holder shall be entitled to convert the Note at any time and from time to time during the Mandatory Conversion Measuring Period pursuant to Section 4(a). Section 5. Certain Adjustments. a) Stock Dividends and Stock Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon conversion of, or payment of interest on, the Note), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. b) [Reserved] c) Pro Rata Distributions. During such time as this Note is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ), at any time after the issuance of this Note, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate, upon and in proportion to Holder s conversion of this Note, in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon such conversion of this Note immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution. d) Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while this Note is outstanding (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of more than 50 of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person, whereby such other Person acquires more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each, a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Note, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this 

8 Note is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction. For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one (1) share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this Note following such Fundamental Transaction.

Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Note and the other Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transaction involving the Holder shall not constitute a Fundamental Transaction. e) Calculations. All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding. f) Notice to the Holder. i.

W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Company and the Purchasers (the Purchase Agreement ), the Company has agreed to sell and issue to the Purchasers, and the Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Company the Notes, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and to induce the Purchasers to enter into the Purchase Agreement and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Purchasers as follows: 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Purchase Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement. The words hereof, herein, hereto and hereunder and words of similar import when used in this Guarantee shall refer to this Guarantee as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Guarantee, and Section and Schedule references are to this Guarantee unless otherwise specified. The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. The following terms shall have the following meanings: Event of Default shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Notes. Guarantee means this Subsidiary Guarantee, as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time. Holder shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Notes. Material Adverse Effect shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 3(a). Purchase Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Preamble. Obligations means, in addition to all other costs and expenses of collection incurred by Purchasers in enforcing any of such Obligations and/or this Guarantee, all of the liabilities and obligations (primary, secondary, direct, contingent, sole, joint or several) due or to become due, or that are now or may be hereafter contracted or acquired, or owing to, of the Company or any Guarantor to the Purchasers, including, without limitation, all obligations under this Guarantee, the Notes, the Documents, and any other instruments, agreements or other documents executed and/or delivered in connection herewith or therewith, in each case, whether now or hereafter existing, voluntary or involuntary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether or not jointly owed with others, and whether or not from time to time decreased or extinguished and later increased, created or incurred, and all or any portion of such obligations or liabilities that are paid, to the extent all or any part of such payment is avoided or recovered directly or indirectly from any of the Purchasers as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise as such obligations may be amended, supplemented, converted, extended or modified from time to time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term Obligations shall include, without limitation: (i) principal of, interest, and any other amounts owed on the Notes as set forth in the Notes; (ii) any and all obligations due under the Documents; (iii) any and all other fees, indemnities, costs, obligations and liabilities of the Company or any Guarantor from time to time under or in connection with this Guarantee, the Notes, the Documents, and any other instruments, agreements or other documents executed and/or delivered in connection herewith or therewith; (iv) all amounts (including but not limited to post-petition interest) in respect of the foregoing that would be payable but for the fact that the obligations to pay such amounts are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Company or any Guarantor; and (v) all foreign assets of the Company or any Guarantor. 

2 4158-1528-3538.1 2. Guarantee. (a) Guarantee. (i) The Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantee to the Purchasers and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations. (ii) Anything herein or in the Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the Documents shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws, including laws relating to the insolvency of debtors, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or laws affecting the rights of creditors generally (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2(b)). (iii) Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of the Purchasers hereunder. (iv) The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until all the Obligations and the obligations of each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been satisfied by indefeasible payment in full. (v) No payment made by the Company, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Purchasers from the Company, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or any payment received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full. (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Guarantee, with respect to any defaulted non- monetary Obligations the specific performance of which by the Guarantors is not reasonably possible (e.g. the issuance of the Company s Common Stock), the Guarantors shall only be liable for making the Purchasers whole on a monetary basis for the Company s failure to perform such Obligations in accordance with the Documents. (b) Right of Contribution. Subject to Section 2(c), each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor s right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2(c). The provisions of this Section 2(b) shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Purchasers and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Purchasers for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder. (c) No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by any Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor by the Purchasers, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Purchasers against the Company or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Purchasers for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Company or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Purchasers by the Company on account of the Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust 

3 4158-1528-3538.1 for the Purchasers, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Purchasers in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Purchasers, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Purchasers may determine. (d) Amendments, Etc. With Respect to the Obligations. Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Purchasers may be rescinded by the Purchasers and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Purchasers, and the Purchase Agreement and the Documents and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Purchasers may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Purchasers for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. The Purchasers shall have no obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by them as security for the Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or any property subject thereto. (e) Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Purchasers upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Section 2; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2; and all dealings between the Company and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2. Each Guarantor waives to the extent permitted by law diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Company or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment and performance without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of the Purchase Agreement or any of the Documents, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Purchasers, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance or fraud by Purchasers) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Company or any other Person against the Purchasers, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Company or such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Company for the Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Purchasers may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as they may have against the Company, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Purchasers to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Company, any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Company, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Purchasers against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof, demand shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. (f) Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Purchasers upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Company or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. 

4 4158-1528-3538.1 (g) Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Purchasers without set-off or counterclaim in U.S. dollars at the address set forth or referred to in the signature pages to the Purchase Agreement. 3. Representations and Warranties. Each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Purchasers as of the date hereof: (a) Organization and Qualification. The Guarantor is an entity duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction set forth on Schedule 1, with the requisite power and authority to own and use its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted. The Guarantor is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case may be, could not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) adversely affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of this Guarantee in any material respect, (y) have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, assets, prospects, or financial condition of the Guarantor or (z) adversely impair in any material respect the Guarantor s ability to perform fully on a timely basis its obligations under this Guarantee (a Material Adverse Effect ). (b) Authorization; Enforcement. The Guarantor has the requisite power and authority to enter into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee, and otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Guarantee by the Guarantor and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the Guarantor. This Guarantee has been duly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or similar laws relating to, or affecting generally the enforcement of, creditors rights and remedies or by other equitable principles of general application. (c) No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee by the Guarantor and the consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or formation documents, or (ii) conflict with, constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture or instrument to which the Guarantor is a party that has not been waived, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or other restriction of any court or governmental authority to which the Guarantor is subject (including Federal and State securities laws and regulations), or by which any material property or asset of the Guarantor is bound or affected that has not been waived, except in the case of each of clauses (ii) and (iii), such conflicts, defaults, terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations as could not, individually or in the aggregate, have or result in a Material Adverse Effect. The business of the Guarantor is not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any governmental authority, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, do not have a Material Adverse Effect. (d) Consents and Approvals. The Guarantor is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court or other federal, state, local, foreign or other governmental authority or other person in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this Guarantee. (e) Purchase Agreement. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Purchase Agreement as they relate to such Guarantor, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, are true and correct as of each time such representations are deemed to be made pursuant to such Purchase Agreement, and the Purchasers shall be entitled to rely on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein, provided that each reference in each such representation and warranty to the Company s knowledge shall, for the purposes of this Section 3, be deemed to be a reference to such Guarantor s knowledge. 

5 4158-1528-3538.1 4. Covenants. (a) Each Guarantor covenants and agrees with the Purchasers that, from and after the date of this Guarantee until the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full, such Guarantor shall take, and/or shall refrain from taking, as the case may be, each commercially reasonable action that is necessary to be taken or not taken, as the case may be, so that no Event of Default is caused by the failure to take such action or to refrain from taking such action by such Guarantor. (b) So long as any of the Obligations are outstanding, unless the Holders shall otherwise consent in writing, each Guarantor will not directly or indirectly on or after the date of this Guarantee: i. enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind, including but not limited to, a guarantee, on or with respect to any of its property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, other than Permitted Indebtedness; ii. enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens of any kind, on or with respect to any of its property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, other than Permitted Liens; iii. amend its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter documents so as to adversely affect any rights of any Purchaser; iv. repay, repurchase or offer to repay, repurchase or otherwise acquire more than a de minimis number of shares of its securities or debt obligations; v. pay cash dividends on any equity securities of the Company; vi. enter into any transaction with any Affiliate of the Guarantor which would be required to be disclosed in any public filing of the Company with the Commission, unless such transaction is made on an arm s-length basis and expressly approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company (even if less than a quorum otherwise required for board approval); or vii. enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. 5. Miscellaneous. (a) Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this Guarantee may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in writing by the Holders and the Company. (b) Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Company, the Guarantors or the Purchasers hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in the Purchase Agreement, provided that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to the Company at its notice address set forth Section 5.4 of the Purchase Agreement. (c) No Waiver By Course Of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. The Purchasers shall not by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 5(a)), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any default under the Documents or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Purchasers, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Purchasers of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Purchasers would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. (d) Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (i) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, or reimburse the Purchasers for, all its costs and expenses incurred in collecting against such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in Section 2 or otherwise enforcing or preserving any rights under this Guarantee and the Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Purchasers. 

6 4158-1528-3538.1 (ii) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Purchasers harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise, sales or other taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee.
