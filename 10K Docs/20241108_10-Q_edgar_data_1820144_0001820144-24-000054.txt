 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Some of the statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, current expectations or projections concerning, among other things, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the markets in which we operate. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as anticipates, approximately, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, goal, intends, may, outlook, plans, potential, predicts, seeks, should, will or the negative version of these words or other comparable words or phrases. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our current views about our business and future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. There are no guarantees that any transactions or events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements: 
 our ability to retain existing users and add new users; 
 the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment, including maintaining compliance with privacy, data protection, and user safety laws and regulations; 
 our ability to address privacy concerns and protect systems and infrastructure from cyber-attacks and prevent unauthorized data access; 
 our success in retaining or recruiting directors, officers, key employees, or other key personnel, and our success in managing any changes in such roles; 
 our ability to respond to general economic conditions; 
 competition in the dating and social networking products and services industry; 
 our ability to adapt to changes in technology and user preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner; 
 our ability to successfully adopt generative artificial intelligence processes and algorithms into our daily operations, including by deploying generative artificial intelligence and machine learning into our products and services; 
 our dependence on the integrity of third-party systems and infrastructure; 
 our ability to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties; 
 whether the concentration of our stock ownership and voting power limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters; and 
 the effects of macroeconomic and geopolitical events on our business, such as health epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, and wars or other regional conflicts. 
 In addition, statements that Grindr believes or we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subjects as of the date of any such statement. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date they are made, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and such statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we are under no obligation (and expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or revise our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause our future results, performance, or transactions to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see the section titled Risk Factors included under Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended (our Annual Report ), as supplemented by the section titled Risk Factors included under Part II, Item 1A, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us (or to third parties making the forward-looking statements).

 operating leases for office space that have lease periods expiring in 2025 and 2026, each with an option to renew. Renewal options are not recognized as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as it was not reasonably certain at the lease commencement dates that the Company would exercise either or both of these options to extend the leases. The Company has signed a third operating lease for office space. However, the Company has not taken possession of the office space and, as such, no right-of use asset and lease liability has been recognized for this operating lease. 
 The Company elected certain practical expedients under ASC Topic 842, Leases, which allows for the combination of lease and non-lease components of lease payments in determining right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities. The Company also elected the short-term lease exception. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Additionally, the Private Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

The Company has an obligation to issue a variable number of shares based on a fixed dollar value divided by the volume weighted-average price per share of the Company s common stock for a period preceding each market capitalization achievement date. These awards are liability-classified and require fair value remeasurement at the end of each reporting period. No market condition awards were granted, forfeited, or issued during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company s annual estimated effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the nondeductible fair value adjustments on the change in the warrant liabilities and also by the change in valuation allowance, nondeductible officer compensation, the foreign derived intangible income deduction, and the research and development credit. Due to the ongoing market volatility of the fair value adjustments on the warrant liabilities, the adjustments are not estimable and as a result, the Company continues to apply the tax effect of the fair value adjustment to the warrant liabilities as a discrete item in the current quarter.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 Grindr Inc. s Grindr or the Company mission is to build the Global Gayborhood in Your Pocket , and, through its success, to make a world where the lives of our global community are free, equal, and just. We manage and operate the Grindr platform, a global social network platform serving and addressing the needs of gay, bi, and sexually explorative people around the world. We had 14.6 million Average MAUs and 1,111 thousand Average Paying Users for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.5 million Average MAUs and 962 thousand Average Paying Users for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We had 14.1 million Average MAUs and 1,057 thousand Average Paying Users for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.1 million Average MAUs and 919 thousand Average Paying Users for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Grindr mobile application is free to download and provides certain services and features to Grindr s users at no cost. We also offer a variety of additional controls and features for users who enroll in our paid subscriptions and add-on products, including Grindr XTRA and Grindr Unlimited. A substantial portion of our revenue is from direct revenue, representing 86.1 and 85.5 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Direct revenue is derived directly from users in the form of subscription fees, providing our users access to a variety of features for the period of their subscription, or in the form of add-ons for pay-per-use access to premium features. Leveraging strong brand awareness and our significant user network stemming from our first mover advantage in the GBTQ social networking industry, our historical growth in number of users has been driven primarily by word-of-mouth referrals and other organic means. Through gayborhood expansion initiatives, we are developing new products for users to engage with the Grindr platform, which include new partnership-based digital versions of services typically found in physical gayborhoods. Our social impact division, Grindr for Equality, advances human rights, health, and safety for millions of LGBTQ people in partnership with organizations in every region of the world. 
 In addition to our revenue generated from subscription fees and premium add-ons, we also generate indirect revenue, representing 13.9 and 14.5 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Indirect revenue includes both first-party and third-party advertising. We provide advertisers with the opportunity to directly target and reach our community. Advertisers on our Grindr platform span across many different industries, including healthcare, entertainment, gaming, travel, and consumer goods. We offer our partners a diverse range of advertising opportunities, including in-app banners, full-screen interstitials, and other customized units, typically sold on a number of impressions basis. Additionally, we contract with a variety of third-party advertising platforms to market and sell digital advertising inventory available on the Grindr platform. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to increase advertising inventory by both enhancing and differentiating our advertising offerings in addition to scaling our advertising volume. 
 While we have users in over 190 countries and territories, our core markets are currently North America and Europe, from which together we derived 84.8 and 85.2 of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We intend to grow our user base and revenues by continuing to introduce new and innovative products and services to all of our users across the globe. 
 We generated 89.3 million and 70.3 million of revenue, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and we generated 247.0 million and 187.6 million of revenue, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, representing period-over-period growth of 27.0 and 31.7 as compared to the corresponding three-month and nine-month periods in 2023, respectively. 
 We had 1,111 thousand and 962 thousand Average Paying User, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and we had 1,057 thousand and 919 thousand Average Paying Users, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, representing period-over-period growth of 15.5 and 15.0 as compared to the corresponding three-month and nine-month periods in 2023, respectively.

 Certain Labor Matters 
 In July 2023, the Communications Workers of America AFL-CIO CWA filed an election petition with the National Labor Relations Board NLRB seeking to hold a representation election for certain classifications of our employees. CWA subsequently filed several unfair labor practice charges against us with the NLRB, including a request for injunctive relief under Sec. 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act. Regarding the election petition, the NLRB conducted a secret mail-ballot election and held partial vote counts in November and December 2023. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the NLRB has not completed tallying all the votes from the election as there are numerous outstanding challenged ballots. On November 1, 2024, the local regional office of NLRB issued a complaint on the unfair labor practice charges, which is scheduled for a hearing in March 2025. This complaint is the first step in the administrative process and is not a finding of any wrongdoing, nor is it a decision or ruling of the NLRB. 
 Recent Developments 
 In September 2024, we merged our Engineering, Product, and Design teams under the leadership of our Chief Product Officer. By combining these three complementary teams into one, we expect to streamline decision-making, enable faster iteration, and create a better experience for our users. 

Consolidated Results for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more details on the calculations and reconciliations.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated: 
 Revenue of 247.0 million and 187.6 million, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 59.4 million, or 31.7 .

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more details on the calculations and reconciliations. 
 
 The Business Combination and Public Company Costs 
 On May 9, 2022, Grindr, Tiga Acquisition Corp. Tiga and Tiga Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiga Merger Sub I entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Original Merger Agreement ), as amended by that certain First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2022, by and among Grindr, Tiga, Merger Sub I and Tiga Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tiga Merger Sub II (together with the Original Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Grindr was merged with and into Merger Sub I, with

Grindr as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiga (the First Merger ), and promptly afterwards and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, the merger of such surviving company with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiga (the Second Merger ), in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The transaction was completed on November 18, 2022 (the Business Combination ). Grindr was deemed the accounting predecessor and the combined entity is the successor registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), meaning that Grindr s condensed consolidated financial statements for previous periods will be disclosed in Grindr s future periodic reports filed with the SEC. 
 While the legal acquirer in the Merger Agreement was Tiga, for financial accounting and reporting purposes under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), Legacy Grindr was the accounting acquirer and the Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. A reverse recapitalization (i.e., a capital transaction involving the issuance of stock by Tiga for the stock of Grindr) did not result in a new basis of accounting, and the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Legacy Grindr in many respects. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of Legacy Grindr became the historical consolidated financial statements of Grindr, and Tiga s assets, liabilities, and results of operations were consolidated with Legacy Grindr beginning on the acquisition date. Operations prior to the Business Combination are presented as those of Legacy Grindr and will be presented as such in future reports. The net assets of Tiga were recognized at historical cost (which was consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded upon execution of the Business Combination. 
 As a consequence of the Business Combination, Grindr became the successor to an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company, which required Grindr to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. Grindr has incurred and expects to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees. The Company is classified as an Emerging Growth Company, as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Act (the JOBS Act ), which was enacted on April 5, 2012. As a result of the Business Combination, the Company is provided certain disclosure and regulatory relief, provided by the SEC, as an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company. 
 Grindr s future results of consolidated operations and financial position may not be comparable to historical results as a result of the Business Combination. 
 
 How We Generate Revenue 
 We currently generate revenue from two revenue streams Direct Revenue and Indirect Revenue both of which are driven by the Grindr platform. Direct Revenue is generated by our users who pay for subscriptions or add-ons to access premium features. Indirect Revenue is generated by third parties who pay us to advertise to our users. 
 Direct Revenue is driven by our subscription revenue and premium add-ons. Our current subscription offerings are Grindr XTRA and Grindr Unlimited. Our subscription revenue has grown through organic user acquisition and the viral network effects enabled by our brand and the quality of our platform. We utilize a freemium model to drive increased user acquisition, subscriber conversions, and monetization on the Grindr platform. We offer premium add-ons on a pay-per-use, or a-la-carte, basis, such as Boost, Roam , and Right Now. By introducing subscription and premium add-on offerings, we continue to increase our Average Paying Users. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Direct Revenue accounted for 86.1 and 85.5 of our total revenue, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Direct Revenue accounted for 87.6 and 86.8 of our total revenue, respectively. 
 Indirect Revenue primarily consists of revenue generated by third parties who pay to advertise to our users. Our advertising offerings provide advertisers with the opportunity to target and directly reach the GBTQ community, a group with significant global purchasing power and economic potential. We have attracted advertisers from a diverse array of industries, including healthcare, entertainment, gaming, travel, and consumer goods. We offer a diverse range of advertising opportunities to advertisers, such as in-app banners, full-screen interstitials, and other customized units, typically on a cost per mille CPM basis. We contract with a variety of third-party advertising platforms to market and sell a portion of our advertising inventory available on the Grindr platform. We intend to continue to grow our Indirect Revenue through advertising, partnerships, and other non-direct initiatives. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Indirect Revenue accounted for 13.9 and 14.5 of our total revenue, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Indirect Revenue accounted for 12.4 and 13.2 of our total revenue, respectively.

 Average Paying Users. A Paying User is a user that has purchased or renewed a Grindr subscription and/or purchased a premium add-on on the Grindr platform. We calculate Average Paying Users by adding up the number of Paying Users in each day and then dividing that number by the number of days in the relevant measurement period. A Paying User who is both a subscriber and an add-on purchaser in the same day will be counted as one Paying User. Duplicate Paying Users may exist if the same individual holds more than one Grindr subscription during the same period. We are focused on building new products and improving on existing ones to drive payer conversion. We believe Average Paying Users is a useful metric for assessing the health of our business. 
 Average MAUs. A Monthly Active User MAU is a unique device that demonstrates activity on the Grindr platform during any given calendar month. Activity on the platform is defined as opening the app, sending or receiving a chat, or viewing another person's profile. We also exclude devices with linked profiles banned for spam. We calculate Average MAUs as a monthly average, by counting the total number of MAUs in each calendar month and then dividing by the number of months in the relevant period. We use Average MAUs to measure the number of active users on our platform on a monthly basis. We believe Average MAUs is a useful metric for assessing the health of our business and our growth in users. 
 Average Paying User Penetration. We calculate Average Paying User Penetration by dividing Average Paying Users by our Average MAUs for any measurement period. We believe Average Paying User Penetration is a useful metric for assessing the overall health of our business. 
 ARPPU. We calculate Average Revenue Per Paid User ARPPU based on Direct Revenue in any measurement period, divided by Average Paying Users in such a period and then divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPPU is a useful metric for assessing the growth of our business and future revenue trends.

Table of Contents 

ARPU. We calculate Average Revenue Per User ARPU based on total revenue in any measurement period, divided by our Average MAUs in such a period divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPU is a useful metric for assessing the growth of our business and future revenue trends. 
 
 Non-GAAP Profitability 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, and free cash flow conversion, which are non-GAAP measures, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of the operational performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding income tax provision (benefit); interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; transaction-related costs; gain (loss) in fair value of warrant liability; and severance expense, litigation-related costs, and other items, in each case, that are unrelated to our core ongoing business operations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional information and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. 
 Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capitalized software, and purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow conversion is calculated by dividing free cash flow for a period by Adjusted EBITDA for the same period. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional information and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities and operating cash flow conversion to free cash flow and free cash flow conversion, respectively. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section titled Risk Factors included under Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended. 
 Growth in User Base and Paying Users 
 We acquire new users through word of mouth as well as through investing in generating brand awareness and affinity. We convert these users to Paying Users by offering premium features that increase the probability of developing meaningful connections, improve the user experience, offer greater control over the experience, and provide the ability to have an ad-free experience. We had 1,111 thousand and 1,057 thousand Average Paying Users for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing period-over-period growth of 15.5 and 15.0 as compared to the three-month and nine-month periods in 2023, respectively. We grow Paying Users by converting new and existing users to purchasers of one of our subscription plans and/or our premium add-on offerings. As we scale and our community grows larger, we are able to facilitate more meaningful interactions as a result of the wider selection of potential connections. This, in addition to the continuous offering of premium features, increases our product value and can increase conversion to one of our paid products. Our revenue growth depends on growth in Paying Users. While we believe we are in the early days of our opportunity, at some point we may face challenges increasing our Paying Users, including competition from alternative products and services and lower adoption of certain product features. 
 Growth in ARPPU 
 We continually work to develop new monetization features and improve existing features in order to increase adoption of premium add-ons and our subscription programs. Many variables will impact our ARPPU, including paid product mix, the geographic location of Paying Users, and the revenue generated from subscription versus premium add-on revenue. Our pricing is in local currency and may vary between markets. As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, transactions carried out in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar could negatively impact revenue and distort year-over-year

Table of Contents 

comparability of operating results. To the extent our ARPPU growth slows, our revenue growth will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase our Average Paying Users. 
 Investing in Growth While Driving Long-Term Profitability 
 Key investment areas for us include continuing to expand and enhance our team as well as enhancing our platform and increasing the value we provide our users. Part of our efforts are focused on introducing new products, improving pricing and packaging, and localizing our products in international markets. We are also harnessing artificial intelligence and machine learning, which we refer to as AI/ML, along with prioritizing security and privacy, and improving matching capabilities for successful connections. 
 Attracting and Retaining Talent 
 Our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talent, including, but not limited to, engineers, data scientists, product designers and product managers. As of September 30, 2024, we had 148 employees globally, 144 of which were full-time employees. We believe that many people want to work at a company committed to creating a world that is fair, equal, and just for the global LGBTQ community and that aligns with their personal values, and therefore our ability to recruit and retain talent is aided by our mission and brand reputation. We compete for talent within the technology industry. 
 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results 
 Temporary variability and general advertising demand 
 Our ability to maintain consistently high advertiser demand for our platform can be affected by temporary trends in advertisers appetites to engage with our users or our brand. For example, events that result in temporary positive or negative publicity for our company (even if unfounded) may play a significant role in our advertisers desire to continue to advertise on our platform. Further, general economic conditions may lead to changes in advertising spending in general, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such fluctuations in advertising demand are often unpredictable and likely temporary, but nevertheless could have a significant impact on the financial condition of our business. 
 Return-to-Office 
 In 2023 our leadership team announced a transition to a hybrid work model involving a multi-phase return-to-office plan RTO Plan beginning in the fall of 2023. Our hybrid work model requires employees to work two days per week in offices where their respective teams are based. The RTO Plan provided employees with a one-time relocation package to support relocation if necessary, or separation packages for employees who chose not to relocate or participate in our RTO Plan. The RTO Plan has temporarily resulted in lower headcount, resulting in a higher reliance on contractors and other services, higher severance expenses in 2023, and lower people related costs. During 2024 and 2025, we are expanding and enhancing our team while selectively supplementing immediate capacity and product development needs with contractors, particularly in supporting our engineering function. 
 International market pricing and changes in foreign exchange rates 
 The Grindr platform has MAUs in over 190 countries and territories. Our international revenue represents 43.1 and 42.5 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 42.4 and 41.5 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We vary our pricing to align with relative value to local purchasing power and competitors while also maximizing our monetization opportunities. Our international revenue is typically earned in local currencies. In addition, the mobile app platforms we work with utilize internally generated foreign exchange rates that may differ from other foreign exchange rates, which could impact our results of operations. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We currently generate revenue from two revenue streams Direct Revenue and Indirect Revenue. Direct revenue is revenue generated by our users who pay for subscriptions or premium add-ons to access premium features. Indirect revenue is generated by third parties who pay us to advertise to our users. As we continue to expand our revenue streams, we anticipate increasing monetization from premium add-ons and subscription offerings, contributing to an increase in

Table of Contents 

direct revenue over time, and increasing our advertising inventory, contributing to an increase in indirect revenue over time. 
 Direct Revenue. Direct revenue is reported gross of distribution fees for subscriptions and premium add-ons as we are the primary party obligated in our transactions with customers, and we act as the principal. Our subscription revenue is generated through the sale of subscriptions that are currently offered or renewed in one-week, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month periods. Subscribers pay in advance through third-party platforms, including Apple, Google Play, and Stripe, according to our terms and conditions. Subscription revenues, net of taxes and chargebacks, are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Premium add-on revenue is generated through the sale of an add-on feature on a pay-per-use, or a-la-carte, basis. Premium features are activated upon purchase and are available for a short duration, generally, within one day. Revenue from premium add-ons is recognized upon purchase of the premium add-on. Direct revenue is recorded net of taxes, credits, and chargebacks. Customers pay in advance, primarily through mobile app stores, and, subject to certain conditions identified in the Company s terms and conditions, generally all purchases are final and nonrefundable. 
 Indirect Revenue . Indirect revenue primarily consists of revenue generated by third parties who pay us to advertise to our users. We provide advertisers with the opportunity to target and directly reach the GBTQ community, a group with significant global purchasing power and economic potential. We have attracted advertisers from a diverse array of industries, including healthcare, gaming, travel, entertainment, and consumer goods. We offer a diverse range of advertising opportunities to advertisers, such as in-app banners, full-screen interstitials, and other customized units, typically on a CPM basis. Revenue from advertising transactions with advertising service providers is recognized net of the amounts retained by the advertising service provider as we do not know and expect not to know the gross amount paid by advertisers. 
 Cost of revenue and operating expenses 
 Cost of revenue . Cost of revenue consists primarily of the distribution fees we pay to Apple and Google Play, infrastructure costs associated with supporting the Grindr platform, which stem largely from our use of Amazon Web Services, and costs associated with content moderation, which involve ensuring that users are complying with our community standards. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs, professional fees, sales and marketing expenditures, and general and administrative expenses, including facilities, insurance, and information technology support. We plan to continue efforts to attract new users, retain existing users and increase monetization of both our new and existing users, which may result in increased sales and marketing expenses in future periods. 
 Product development expense. Product development expense consists primarily of employee-related and contractor costs for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing, enhancement of product offerings, related technology, and related software costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is primarily related to computers, equipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization is primarily related to capitalized software, acquired definite-lived intangible assets (customer relationships, technology, etc.). 
 Other income (expense) 
 Interest expense, net . Interest expense, net consists of interest expense incurred in connection with our long-term debt and revolving credit facility, net of interest income received on a promissory note to a member. 
 Other income (expense), net . Other income (expense), net consists of realized and unrealized exchange rate gains or losses. 
 Gain (loss) in fair value of warrant liability. Gain (loss) in fair value of warrant liability represents the change in fair value of our public and private warrants. As the private warrants are substantially similar to the public warrants, all of the warrants are remeasured from the publicly traded quotes from the active market. 
 Income tax provision 
 Income tax provision represents the income tax expense associated with our operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rates will vary depending on changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, fluctuations in permanent differences, and changes in tax laws.

 Revenue 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 89.3 million and 70.3 million, respectively. The increase in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 19.0 million, or 27.0 . 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct revenue was 76.9 million and 61.6 million, respectively. The increase in direct revenue of 15.3 million, or 24.8 , was driven by year-over-year increases in ARPPU of 1.74 and in Average Paying Users of 149 thousand. Year-over-year growth for both ARPPU and Averaging Paying Users is a result of (i) higher conversion of free to paid users as more users responded favorably to shorter duration subscription offerings through the roll out of our weekly Unlimited subscription offerings to all of our users worldwide, (ii) the launch of various packaging and marketing initiatives intended to drive conversation, and (iii) continued MAU growth. Weekly Unlimited was introduced late in the first quarter of 2024, giving our users a second lower priced option in addition to the weekly XTRA subscription. ARPPU increased by 8.2 , or 1.74, to 23.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our ARPPU increased as a result of improved product mix, with higher revenue generated by subscription products with higher average monthly-equivalent price, such as weekly Unlimited. We expect ARPPU to fluctuate in the near-term as we continue to test different subscription options across different price points and focus on generating more Paying Users. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Average Paying Users increased by 149 thousand, from 962 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,111 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, indirect revenue was 12.4 million and 8.7 million, respectively. The increase in indirect revenue of 3.7 million, or 42.5 , was primarily driven by growth in revenue from interstitial advertising from our third-party advertising platforms as new partners were added and use of interstitial advertising continued, as well as growth in direct brand sales as the number of direct brand advertisers on the platform grew. 
 Revenue from North America increased by 10.8 million, or 25.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 53.3 million as compared to 42.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During this same period,

revenue from Europe increased by 5.4 million, or 30.8 , to 22.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from the remainder of the world increased by 2.9 million, or 28.6 , to 13.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 247.0 million and 187.6 million, respectively. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 59.4 million increase, or 31.7 . 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, direct revenue was 211.2 million and 162.9 million, respectively. The increase in direct revenue of 48.3 million, or 29.7 was driven by the year-over-year increase in ARPPU of 2.51 and in Average Paying Users of 138 thousand. Year-over-year growth for both ARPPU and Averaging Paying Users is largely a result of rolling out our weekly XTRA and weekly Unlimited subscription offerings Weeklies ), to all of our users worldwide, the launch of various packaging and marketing initiatives to drive conversion, as well as a result of continued MAU growth. Weekly XTRA was introduced late in the second quarter of 2023 and weekly Unlimited was introduced late in the first quarter of 2024. Introducing our shorter duration Weeklies products gave our users lower priced options for both XTRA and Unlimited subscriptions. ARPPU increased by 12.7 , or 2.51, to 22.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 19.69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our ARPPU increased mainly as a result of improved product mix with higher revenue from subscription products with higher average monthly price. We expect ARPPU to fluctuate in the near-term as we continue to test different subscription options across different price points and focus on generating more Paying Users. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Average Paying Users increased by 138 thousand, from 919 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,057 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, indirect revenue was 35.8 million and 24.7 million, respectively. The increase in indirect revenue of 11.1 million, or 44.9 was primarily driven by growth in revenue from third-party advertising platforms.

During this same period, revenue from Europe increased by 16.0 million, or 36.0 , to 60.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 44.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from the remainder of the world increased by 9.7 million, or 35.0 , to 37.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 27.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 22.9 million and 18.2 million, respectively.

 Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 63.5 million and 49.2 million, respectively. The 14.3 million increase, or 29.1 , was primarily due to growth in app store distribution fees of 11.0 million (consistent with direct revenue growth), and increased infrastructure costs of 3.6 million. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 25.0 million and 16.4 million, respectively.

Product development expense 
 Product development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 8.8 million and 13.3 million, respectively. The 4.5 million decrease, or 33.8 is primarily related to a 5.9 million decrease in personnel-related expenses, primarily driven by 6.5 million of severance expense incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the RTO Plan. This decrease is partially offset by a 1.7 million increase in contractor fees to support the engineering function while scaling the size of our team. 
 Product development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 22.3 million and 25.0 million, respectively.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, and free cash flow conversion as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of the operational performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding income tax provision (benefit); interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; transaction-related costs; gain (loss) in fair value of warrant liability; and severance expense, litigation-related costs, and other items, in each case, that are unrelated to our core ongoing business operations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period. 
 Management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which management and other employees are compensated. We exclude the above items as some are non-cash in nature and others may not be representative of normal operating results. While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capitalized software and purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is an indicator of liquidity that provides information to our management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations, after capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment, that can be used to repay debt obligations and/or for strategic initiatives. Free cash flow conversion is calculated by dividing free cash flow for a period by Adjusted EBITDA for the same period. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion do not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments.

Cash flows provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities is primarily dependent on our revenues and is affected by timing of receipts from subscription and advertising sales. It is also dependent on managing our operating expenses, such as salaries and employee-related costs, selling and marketing expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. We expect to maintain strong operating cash flows given our historical performance. We will continue to try to invest in the right resources to support longer term profitable growth. Our operating cash flows should continue to cover our operating and financing costs. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operations provided 65.4 million of cash, which was primarily attributable to our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, which include 45.6 million in loss in fair value of warrant liability, stock-based compensation of 22.6 million, and 12.6 million in depreciation and amortization; partially offset by a decrease in net working capital of 8.3 million, primarily from a 9.4 million increase in account receivables due to the increase in direct revenue and indirect revenue during the year. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operations provided 23.1 million of cash, which was primarily attributable to our net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, which include 21.8 million in depreciation and amortization, 11.6 million in the fair value change in warrant liability and 6.0 million in other non-cash adjustments; partially offset by a decrease in net working capital of 5.3 million, primarily from a 10.4 million increase in account receivables due to the increase in direct revenue and indirect revenue during the year. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of additions to capitalized software of 3.4 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of additions to capitalized software of 3.2 million. 
 Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of principal payments of debt of 47.1 million, payments to tax authorities for employee equity awards of 5.6 million, net of 2.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 19.4 million in proceeds from repayment of a promissory note to a member and related interest, and 2.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, partially offset by 18.7 million related to the principal paydown of our long-term debt. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, and the sale of equity. To the extent existing cash, investments, and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked, or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain additional covenants that restrict operations, including our ability to raise additional capital. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders. We may also enter into investment or acquisition transactions in the future, which could require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 39.1 million. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated by operations, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 See Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 In November 2023, we refinanced our existing credit facility with a new 300.0 million term loan and 50.0 million revolving credit facility. We entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (the 2023 Credit Agreement that governs the term loan and revolving credit facility. We borrowed the full amount of the 300.0 million term loan and 44.4 million under the revolving credit facility upon closing 
 36 

Table of Contents 

of the new credit agreement and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay in full all outstanding obligations under, and terminate, our prior credit agreement with Fortress Credit Corp. As of November 5, 2024, 285.8 million was outstanding under the term loan and 11.6 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In January 2024, April 2024, and June 2024, we repaid 22.0 million, 7.0 million, and 3.8 million, respectively, under our revolving credit facility. We have the option to request that lenders increase the amount available under the revolving credit facility by, or obtain incremental term loans of, up to 100.0 million, subject to the terms of the 2023 Credit Agreement and only if existing or new lenders choose to provide additional term or revolving commitments. 
 Our wholly owned subsidiary, Grindr Capital LLC, is the borrower under the 2023 Credit Agreement and all obligations of Grindr Capital LLC under the 2023 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Grindr Inc. and, subject to certain limited exceptions, our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the assets of Grindr Inc., Grindr Capital LLC, and the guarantor subsidiaries. 
 Borrowings under our the 2023 Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans) bear interest at a rate equal to either, at our option, (i) the highest of the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement), the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) plus 0.50 , or one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) plus 1.00 (the Alternate Base Rate or (ii) Term SOFR, in each case, plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.75 to 3.25 with respect to Term SOFR borrowings and 1.75 to 2.25 with respect to Alternate Base Rate borrowings. The applicable margin will be based upon our total net consolidated leverage ratio. Swingline loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin. We are also required to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which will range from 0.375 to 0.50 per annum, depending on our total consolidated net leverage ratio. 
 The term loan will amortize on a quarterly basis at 1.25 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of the initial closing date of the 2023 Credit Agreement, until the final maturity date on November 28, 2028. Any borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time without any other premium or penalty, and any amounts repaid under the revolving credit facility may be reborrowed, in each case, until the maturity date on November 28, 2028. 
 Mandatory prepayments are required under the revolving credit facility when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed the aggregate revolving commitments of all lenders. Mandatory prepayments are also required under the term loan in connection with (i) certain asset dispositions and casualty events, in each case, to the extent the proceeds of such dispositions or casualty events exceed certain individual and aggregate thresholds and are not reinvested, and (ii) unpermitted debt transactions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were not required to make any mandatory repayments. 
 The 2023 Credit Agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants including a maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The 2023 Credit Agreement also contains customary restrictive covenants regarding indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments, restricted payments, disposition of assets, transactions with affiliates, hedging transactions, certain prepayments of indebtedness, amendments to organizational documents, and sale and leaseback transactions. The 2023 Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default. If an event of default has occurred and continues beyond any applicable cure period, all outstanding obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement may be accelerated or the commitments may be terminated, amongst other remedies. Additionally, the lenders are not obligated to fund any new borrowing under the 2023 Credit Agreement while an event of default is continuing. 
 
 Uses of Cash 
 
 Contractual obligations and other uses of cash 
 Our principal commitments have not materially changed from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consist of obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement, operating leases for office space, and our payments for the use of cloud services. In addition, we are subject to pending legal proceedings from time to time, including a potential Norwegian Data Protection Authority fine. See Note 6, Note 7 and Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of 
 37 

Table of Contents 

assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from our estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our discussion of critical accounting estimates from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that such information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as a result of the material weakness that existed in our payroll processes as of September 30, 2024, as discussed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended. 
 Remediation Plan 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have designed and implemented controls and processes to remediate the material weakness indicated above. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various claims, lawsuits, government investigations, settlements and proceedings relating to our operations. Although the results of the claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe the final outcome of certain matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than those proceedings for which it is too early to determine the materiality and probability of outcome. Information relating to various commitments and contingencies is described in Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In the future, we may be subject to additional legal proceedings, the scope and severity of which is unknown and which could adversely affect our business. In addition, from time to time, others may assert claims against us and we may assert claims and legal proceedings against other parties, including in the form of letters and other forms of communication. 
 The results of any current or future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and, regardless of the outcome, can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended. 
 Our integration of artificial intelligence-driven features, including Wingman, may expose us to a variety of legal, reputational, operational, and regulatory risks. 
 We are in the process of building artificial intelligence AI technologies into our services, including generative AI and machine learning ML ). For example, we are creating the Grindr Wingman, which is intended to be an assistant helping users navigate our app and enhance their overall user experience. The adoption of AI processes and algorithms into our daily operations and our app, including through offerings like Wingman, may result in adverse effects to our operations, legal liability, reputation, and competitive risks. See Risks Related to our Brand, Products and Services, and Operations We use generative artificial intelligence and machine learning in our products and services which may result in operational challenges, legal liability, reputational concerns, competitive risks and regulatory concerns that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. in Item 1A Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report. 
 AI chat and other AI-driven features, particularly in socially intimate contexts, have come under heightened legal and regulatory scrutiny. The cost of compliance or potential non-compliance with new or existing regulations could be significant and could require us to adjust our features or face penalties. In addition, the risks we face from a potential narrowing of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are exacerbated as we increasingly use AI, ML, and other algorithmic approaches to suggest specific users that other users may be interested in connecting with. We may face lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other adverse actions seeking to hold us liable for harms suffered by a user as a result of online or physical interactions with other users with whom our systems or Wingman suggested that they consider connecting. See R isks Related to Regulation and Litigation Activities of our users or content made available by such users could subject us to liability, including with respect to user safety. and Online applications are subject to various laws and regulations relating to children s privacy and protection, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions. in Item 1A Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report. 
 Moreover, the move to AI content generation through our development of Wingman and other AI features brings additional risks and responsibility. Known risks of generative AI currently include risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy, security, and data provenance, including intellectual property issues. AI-driven features within the Grindr app may generate responses that are perceived as inappropriate, inaccurate, insensitive, or harmful, impacting user satisfaction and safety. AI-generated messages, despite safeguards, may suggest or lead to interactions or user behaviors that could be harmful or offensive. This could lead to user dissatisfaction, increased support costs, potential claims against us, or reputational harm. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation will require additional investment in the licensing or development of proprietary datasets; AI and ML models; and systems to test for accuracy, bias, and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin. If we are unable to successfully adapt or scale Wingman and other AI features in a manner that enhances rather than diminishes user experience, our investment in this area could fail to yield anticipated returns, or may even impact user trust, discourage engagement, and ultimately lead to decreased retention. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

Wingman and other AI-driven features require data processing that could also expose us to data privacy and security risks, or subject us to increased regulatory obligations. See Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation The varying and rapidly evolving regulatory framework on privacy and data protection, including across jurisdictions and other obligations, could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business. in Item 1A Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report. 
 We are developing and may develop Wingman and other AI technologies in part via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements. If these third-party platforms fail to meet performance expectations, it could result in degraded user experiences or system disruptions that may harm user satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, if we lose access to third-party large language models or other AI- or ML-related technologies that we rely on, we may be unable to maintain key features or may incur substantial costs to transition to alternative solutions. Any interruptions or loss of functionality resulting from our reliance on these third-parties could adversely impact our business, reputation, and financial results. 
 Failure to effectively manage these risks associated with Wingman and other AI-driven features could harm our reputation; reduce user engagement; and materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
