reverse stock split of Acorn s Common Stock (the Reverse
Stock Split ). Acorn filed the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 6, 2023,
and the Reverse Stock Split became effective at 5:00 p.m. EDT on September 7, 2023. At the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split,
every sixteen issued and outstanding shares of Acorn s Common Stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding
share of Common Stock, without any change in the par value per share. Stockholders who would have otherwise been entitled to fractional
shares of Common Stock, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, received a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares. The value
of the fractional shares repurchased was and equated to fifty-eight shares. All share and per share amounts of common stock, options
and warrants contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and related footnotes have been restated for all periods to give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split and the related fractional
share repurchase for all prior periods presented. Accordingly, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity (Deficit) reflects
the impact of the Reverse Stock Split by reclassifying from Common Stock to Additional paid in capital an
amount equal to the aggregate par value of the number of shares by which the total number of shares outstanding decreased as a result
of the Reverse Stock Split. 

at September 30, 2024. The Company does not believe there is a significant risk of non-performance by its counterparties. For the
nine- and three-month period ended September 30, 2024, there was one customer that represented 
and ,
respectively, of the Company s total invoiced sales. At September 30, 2024, the Company had one customer that represented 
of its total accounts receivable due by December 29, 2024 based on the customer s payment terms.
The customer with this concentration of both invoiced sales and accounts receivable is the customer under the material contract that
was executed in June 2024. See Note 10 for further discussion. Approximately 
of the accounts receivable at December 31, 2023 was due from one customer which was subsequently collected in full. Credit risk with
respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company s
customer base. Although we do not believe there is significant risk of non-performance by these counterparties, any failures or
defaults on their part could negatively impact the value of our financial instruments and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operations or financial condition.

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of . Its working capital includes of cash and deferred revenue
of . Such deferred revenue does not require a significant cash outlay for the revenue to be recognized. Total deferred revenue
decreased by , from at December 31, 2023 to at September 30, 2024, as a result of the sales mix of products
sold. Based on the current products being sold, the Company expects continued decreases in the deferred revenue balance in the foreseeable
future. The balance of deferred hardware revenue at September 30, 2024 will continue to be amortized over the months remaining in the
three-year period since the hardware s original date of shipment. Net cash increased during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 by , with provided by operating activities, used in investing activities, and provided by financing
activities. 

As
of November 5, 2024, the Company had cash of . The Company believes that such cash, plus the cash expected to be generated
from operations, will provide sufficient liquidity to finance the corporate activities of Acorn and operating activities of OmniMetrix
at their current level of operations for at least the twelve-month period from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. The Company may, at some point, elect to obtain financing to fund additional investments in the business. If the
Company decides to pursue additional financing in the future, it may be in the form of a bank line, a new loan or investment by others,
an equity raise by Acorn which could then facilitate a loan by Acorn to OmniMetrix, or any combination thereof. Whether alternative funds,
such as third-party loans or investments, will be available at the time and on terms acceptable to Acorn and OmniMetrix cannot be determined
at this time. 

The
Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life
of its receivables considering current market conditions and estimates for supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company measures
expected credit losses on its trade receivables on an entity-by-entity basis. The estimate of expected credit losses considers a historical
loss experience rate that is adjusted for delinquency trends, collection experience, and/or economic risk where appropriate. Additionally,
management develops a specific allowance for trade receivables known to have a high risk of expected future credit loss. 

The
Company has historically experienced immaterial write-offs given the nature of the customers that receive credit. As of September 30,
2024, the Company had gross receivables of and an allowance for credit losses of .

Buford, Georgia, for a monthly sublease payment of (plus an annual escalator each year of 3 which includes the base rent plus
a pro-rata share of utilities, property taxes and insurance. Fifty percent of any excess rent received above the per square foot amount
that the Company pays will be remitted to the Company s landlord less the allocation of any shared expenses and leasehold improvements
specific to the sublease. During each of the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, after the offset of the
investment in leasehold improvements and other expenses related to the sublease, the Company paid its landlord and , respectively.

(b)
Summary Employee Option Information 

The
Company s stock option plans provide for the grant to officers, directors and employees of options to purchase shares of common
stock. The purchase price may be paid in cash or, if the option is in-the-money at the end of the option term, it is automatically
exercised net . In a net exercise of an option, the Company does not require a payment of the exercise price of the option
from the optionee but reduces the number of shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of the option by the smallest number of whole
shares that has an aggregate fair market value equal to or in excess of the aggregate exercise price for the option shares covered by
the option exercised. Each option is exercisable for one share of the Company s common stock. Most options expire within five to
ten years from the date of the grant, and generally vest over a three-year period from the date of the grant. 

At
September 30, 2024, options were available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and no options were
available for grant under the 2006 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024,
 options were issued of which all were issued in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. options were issued in the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024. The options were issued as follows: an aggregate of to directors (excluding the CEO), to
the CEO, to the CFO and an aggregate of to employees. In the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, there
were grants to non-employees (other than the directors, CEO and CFO). 

During
the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, options were exercised, all of which were exercised in the three-month
period ended March 31, 2024. No options were exercised in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to estimate fair value, utilizing the following assumptions for the respective years (all in weighted averages):

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements relating to the Company which represent the Company s current expectations
or beliefs including, but not limited to, statements concerning the Company s operations, performance, financial condition and
growth. For this purpose, any statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as may , anticipate , intend , could ,
 estimate or continue or the negative or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, such as credit losses, dependence on management
and key personnel, variability of quarterly results, and the ability of the Company to continue its growth strategy and the Company s
competition, certain of which are beyond the Company s control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize
or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, or any of the other risks set out under the caption Risk Factors 
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 occur, actual outcomes and results could differ
materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. 

Any
forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect
the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such
factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 

All
dollar amounts in the discussion below are rounded to the nearest thousand, except per share data, and, thus, are approximate.

BACKLOG 

As
of September 30, 2024, OmniMetrix had a backlog of 4,384,000, primarily comprised of deferred revenue, of which 3,572,000 is expected
to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months. This compares to a backlog of 6,211,000 at September 30, 2023. Now that we are
selling hardware units that are capable of operating distinctly from our monitoring and control software, the hardware backlog will no
longer continue to grow and will be fully amortized by August 31, 2026, while the monitoring backlog will continue to be deferred and
amortized over the period of service. 

RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS 

On
June 1, 2024, we entered into a contract with one of the nation s largest cell phone providers to provide monitoring hardware and
services. Under the contract, OmniMetrix will provide monitoring devices and related remote monitoring and control services for between
5,000 to 10,000 cell tower backup generators in the U.S. The monitoring hardware and monitoring services, which will be deployed over
a two-year period, commenced in the third quarter during which we recognized 724,000 in hardware revenue from this contract. We expect
to generate total revenue over the life of the contract of approximately 5 million which encompasses the revenue from the sales of the
hardware and the first year of monitoring. 

On
January 12, 2024, we entered into a new contract with our current primary data provider for Internet of Things (IoT) wireless services
for a 36-month contract term with automatic one-year extensions, subject to termination notice. The pricing structure involves account
setup, SIM charges, monthly revenue obligations, and various rate plans based on data usage and regions along with other optional services.
The monthly expense obligation is 10,000 for the first 6 months and 15,000 thereafter. We are also eligible for volume discounts based
on total monthly service revenue. Additionally, the agreement includes an IoT Enhanced Support and Priority Care Services Rate Plan with
various support service types and pricing tiers based on the number of devices and terms for SIM migrations, including tiered pricing
and conditions for waiver of certain charges during migration. This agreement allows us to migrate our customers to higher tier data
plans for nominal additional cost.

OVERVIEW
AND TREND INFORMATION 

Acorn
Energy, Inc. Acorn or the Company is a holding company focused on technology-driven solutions for energy
infrastructure asset management. We provide the following services and products through our OmniMetrix TM , LLC OmniMetrix subsidiary: 

Power
 Generation PG ). OmniMetrix s PG services provide wireless remote monitoring and control systems and IoT
 applications for residential and commercial/industrial power generation equipment. This includes OmniMetrix s TrueGuard power
 generator monitors and AIRGuard product, which remotely monitors and controls industrial air compressors, and its Smart Annunciator
 product, which is typically sold to commercial customers that require a visual representation of the generator s status and
 has a touchscreen display that indicates the current state of that generator. 

Cathodic
 Protection CP ). OmniMetrix s CP services provide remote monitoring and control products for cathodic protection
 systems on gas pipelines serving the gas utilities market and pipeline operators. The CP product lineup includes solutions to remotely
 monitor and control rectifiers, test stations and bonds. OmniMetrix also offers the industry s first RAD TM (Remote
 AC Mitigation Disconnect) that mounts onto existing Solid-state Decouplers in the field and can remotely disconnect/connect these
 AC mitigation tools, which can drastically reduce a company s expense while increasing employee safety. 

Each
of our PG and CP activities represents a reportable segment. The following analysis should be read together with the segment and revenue
information provided in Notes 9 and 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report. 

OmniMetrix 

OmniMetrix
is a Georgia limited liability company based in Buford, Georgia that develops and markets wireless remote monitoring and control systems
and services for multiple markets in the Internet of Things IoT ecosystem: critical assets (including stand-by power
generators, pumps, pumpjacks, light towers, turbines, compressors, and other industrial equipment) as well as cathodic protection for
the pipeline industry (gas utilities and pipeline companies). Acorn owns 99 of OmniMetrix with 1 owned by the former CEO of OmniMetrix. 

Following
the emergence of machine-to-machine (M2M) and IoT applications, whereby companies aggregate multiple sensors and monitors into a simplified
dashboard for customers, OmniMetrix believes it plays a key role in this new economic ecosystem. In addition, OmniMetrix sees a rapidly
growing need for backup power infrastructure to secure critical military, government, and private sector assets against emergency events
including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, and other issues related to the reliability of the electric power
grid. As residential and industrial standby generators, turbines, compressors, pumps, pumpjacks, light towers and other industrial equipment
are part of the critical infrastructure increasingly monitored in IoT applications and given that OmniMetrix monitors all major brands
of critical equipment, OmniMetrix believes it is well-positioned as a competitive participant in this market. 

OmniMetrix
sells monitoring hardware devices and data monitoring services. On September 1, 2023, we launched an updated version of our products
that includes new functionality in our TrueGuard, AIRGuard, Patriot and Hero products that allows our customers to have options as it
relates to obtaining and utilizing the data that is provided by our hardware devices. This new functionality allows for SIM card options,
configuration options regarding IP address endpoints and DNS routes, and access to our over-the-air data protocol. This product update
allows customers to have the option to purchase our monitoring service, monitor the products themselves if they have the ability in-house,
or choose another monitoring provider if they so desire, whereas, historically, our standard products only functioned with our monitoring
services. The modification to the circuit boards and embedded firmware of hardware enclosures in stock as of August 31, 2023 were made
such that only the new version of these products was sold subsequent to this date. Prior to such product modification, revenue (and related
costs) associated with sale of equipment was recorded to deferred revenue (and deferred charges) upon shipment for PG and CP monitoring
units. This deferred revenue and the deferred cost of the hardware with respect to the sale of new equipment was recognized over the
life of the units, which was estimated to be three years. Revenue from hardware sales subsequent to August 31, 2023 is recognized upon
shipment, instead of being deferred. Revenues from the prepayment of monitoring fees (generally paid in advance) are initially recorded
as deferred revenue upon receipt of payment from the customer and then amortized to revenue over the monitoring service period (typically
twelve-month, renewable periods).

Revenue
for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue
increased by 1,648,000, or 28.4 , from 5,809,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 7,457,000 in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024. Hardware revenue increased by 1,470,000, or 55.7 , from 2,637,000 in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 to 4,107,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. During the nine-month period ended September 30,
2024, we recognized 724,000 in hardware revenue pursuant to sales under the Material Contract discussed above under Recent
Developments . See the reconciliation of hardware revenue below. Monitoring revenue
increased by 178,000, or 5.6 , from 3,172,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 3,350,000 in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024. The monitoring revenue under the Material Contract is not permitted to be invoiced until the
hardware is installed and the customer has accepted the monitoring services in their spend management software portal; thus, the
increase in hardware and monitoring revenue will not align. The increase in monitoring revenue was due to an increase in the number
of connections being monitored in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month-period ended September
30, 2023. 

As
discussed above, OmniMetrix has two reportable segments, PG and CP. Of the 7,457,000 in revenue recognized in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, 6,681,000 was generated by PG activities and 776,000 was generated by CP activities. This represents an increase
in revenue from PG activities of 1,687,000, or 33.8 , from 4,994,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, and a decrease
in revenue from CP activities of 39,000, or 4.8 , from 815,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase in PG revenue was due to the revenue contribution from the Material Contract, an increase in the revenue recognized from TG
Pro and TG2 products, and an increase in PG monitoring revenue due to an increase in the number of connections being monitored. The
decrease in CP revenue was due to a decrease in installation income as we recognized 38,000 in CP installation income in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 which was nonrecurring. Other than this item, the period-over-period CP revenue was flat, with a decrease of 8,000 in monitoring
revenue offset by a 7,000 increase in revenue from hardware and other accessories. The new version of the PG and CP hardware was sold
in 2024; thus, the revenue was recognized when the units were shipped instead of being deferred and amortized over three years as had
been the case prior to the September 1, 2023 product modification. 

Revenue
increased by 963,000, or 46.1 , from 2,087,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 3,050,000 in the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024. Of the 3,050,000 in revenue recognized in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, 2,826,000
was generated by PG activities and 224,000 was generated by CP activities. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, revenue from PG activities increased 1,028,000, or 57.2 , from 1,798,000, and revenue
from CP activities decreased 65,000, or 22.5 , from 289,000. 

Hardware
revenue during the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is further detailed in the table below (in thousands):

Gross
profit for the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Gross
profit for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 5,443,000, reflecting a gross margin of 73.0 , compared with a gross
profit of 4,356,000, reflecting a gross margin of 75.0 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The gross margin was
lower in the current period due to a greater volume of hardware sales which have a lower gross margin than monitoring. 

Gross
margin on hardware revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 55.5 compared to 53.4 for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. Gross margin on monitoring revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 94.5 compared to 93.0. 
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross
profit for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 2,187,000, reflecting a gross margin of 71.7 , compared with a gross
profit for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 1,550,000, reflecting a gross margin of 74.3 . The gross margin was lower
in the current period due to a greater volume of hardware sales which have a lower gross margin than monitoring. Gross margin on hardware
revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 58.1 compared to 54.1 for the three-month period ended September 30,
2023 which was due to the change in the product mix positively impacted by the Material Contract. Gross margin on monitoring revenue
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 94.5 compared to 93.0 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating
expenses for the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

R D
expense. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, R D expense was 698,000 and 614,000, respectively.
During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, OmniMetrix recorded 234,000 of R D expense as compared to 212,000 in the
three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R D expense is primarily related to the increased salaries of our engineering
staff that were effective October 1, 2023 and the continued investment to redesign and expand our product line to continue to increase
our level of innovation ahead of our competitors. 

Selling,
general and administrative expense. SG A expense of the consolidated entities in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2024 reflected a decrease of 93,000, or 2.5 , as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. OmniMetrix s
SG A expense decreased 50,000, or 1.7 , from 2,932,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 2,882,000 in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of (i) 35,000 in personnel expenses due
to two sales roles that have been unfilled for a portion of 2024 and that we are considering eliminating offset by annual salary
increases that were effective October 1, 2023, (ii) 34,000 in sales tax and other business tax related expenses, (iii) 24,000 in
depreciation expense, (iv) 29,000 in travel and trade show expenses, and (v) 13,000 in commission expense offset by increases of
 82,000 in technology expenses for software and IT professional fees and a net increase in other business expenses of 3,000.
Corporate SG A expense decreased 43,000, or 5.3 , from 814,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 771,000
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to a decrease of 102,000 in expenses related to the
reverse stock split executed in September 2023 which were not reoccurring in 2024 and net aggregate decreases in other
administrative expenses of 13,000 offset by increases of (i) 18,000 in legal fees due to an increase in our monthly retainer
effective January 1, 2024, (ii) 18,000 in audit fees due to an increase in engagement fees year over year of 14 and also to the
timing of when the services were performed, (iii) 12,000 in tax professional fees primarily due to the preparation of our 2023 tax
provision, (iv) 12,000 in stock compensation expense due to options issued at higher exercise prices, and (v) 12,000 in officer
fees due to a 3 increase effective January 1, 2024 

23 

SG A
expense of the consolidated entities in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 reflected a decrease of 133,000, or 10.0 , as
compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. OmniMetrix s SG A expense decreased 30,000, or 3.0 , from 990,000
in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 960,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was
primarily due to a decrease of (i) 46,000 in personnel expenses due to two sales roles that were unfilled in the third quarter of 2024
offset by annual salary increases that were effective October 1, 2023, (ii) 18,000 in travel and trade show expenses, (iii) 17,000
in sales tax and other business tax related expenses, and (iv) 12,000 in commission expense offset by an increase of 59,000 in technology
expenses for software and IT professional fees and a 4,000 net increase, in the aggregate, across other expense categories. Corporate
SG A expense decreased 103,000, or 30.3 , from 340,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 237,000 in the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to a decrease of 102,000 in expenses related to the reverse stock split executed
in September 2023 which were not reoccurring in 2024 and net aggregate decreases in other administrative expenses of 16,000 offset by
increases of 6,000 in legal fees due to an increase in the monthly retainer effective January 1, 2024 and 9,000 in audit fees due to
an increase in engagement fees year over year of 14 and also to the timing of when the services were performed. 

Net
income attributable to Acorn Energy. We recognized net income attributable to Acorn stockholders of 1,061,000 in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income attributable to Acorn stockholders of 35,000 in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net income attributable to Acorn stockholders
of 725,000, compared to a net income attributable to Acorn stockholders of 24,000 for the three- month period ended September 30, 2023.
Our net income during the nine- and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of the components listed in the

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 277,000. Our working capital includes 2,153,000 of cash and deferred revenue of 3,572,000.
The deferred revenue does not require a significant cash outlay for the revenue to be recognized. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our OmniMetrix subsidiary provided 1,647,000 from operations while our corporate headquarters
used 908,000 during the same period. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 48,000 in technology and other capital projects and received proceeds of 13,000
from financing activities related to the exercise of options. 

Other
Liquidity Matters 

Intercompany 

OmniMetrix
owes Acorn 2,158,000 for amounts loaned, accrued interest and expenses paid by Acorn on OmniMetrix s behalf as of September 30,
2024 as compared to 2,657,000 as of December 31, 2023. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the intercompany amount
due to Acorn from OmniMetrix decreased by 499,000. This included repayments of 784,000 offset by interest of 96,000, dividends of
 57,000 due to Acorn and 132,000 in shared expenses paid by Acorn. These intercompany balances and amounts are eliminated in consolidation. 

24 

Liquidity 

As
of November 5, 2024, we had cash of 2,087,000. We believe that such cash, plus the cash generated from operations, will provide
sufficient liquidity to finance the operating activities of Acorn and OmniMetrix at their current level of operations for the twelve
months from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We may, at some point, elect to obtain financing
to fund additional investments in the business. If we decide to pursue additional financing in the future, it may be in the form of a
bank line, a new loan or investment by others, an equity raise by Acorn which could then facilitate a loan by Acorn to OmniMetrix, or
any combination thereof. Whether alternative funds, such as third-party loans or investments, will be available at the time and on terms
acceptable to Acorn and OmniMetrix cannot be determined at this time.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our CEO
and CFO concluded that, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

As
noted in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we employ a decentralized internal control methodology,
coupled with management s oversight, whereby our subsidiary is responsible for mitigating its risks to financial reporting by implementing
and maintaining effective control policies and procedures and subsequently translating that respective risk mitigation up and through
to the parent level and to the Company s external consolidated financial statements. Also, as the Company s subsidiary is
not large enough to effectively mitigate certain risks by segregating incompatible duties, management must employ compensating mechanisms
throughout the Company in a manner that is feasible given the constraints within which it operates. 

25 

The
material weaknesses management identified were caused by an insufficient complement of resources at our OmniMetrix subsidiary and limited
IT system capabilities, such that individual control policies and procedures could not be implemented, maintained, or remediated when
and where necessary. More specifically, there were material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting related
to ineffective design and implementation of information technology general controls ITGCs in the areas of user access,
program change management and vendor management controls. 

As
a result, a majority of the significant process areas management identified for our OmniMetrix subsidiary had three material weaknesses
present. This condition was further exacerbated as the Company could not demonstrate that each of the principles described within COSO s
(the Committee of Sponsoring Organization s) document Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) were present
and functioning. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we have implemented the following (i) a process pursuant to which System and Organization
Controls (SOC) reports are obtained from third-party vendors on a recurring schedule and such reports are evaluated for any issues, (ii)
provisioning/termination controls with signed and authenticated authorizations, and (iii) change controls for development processes that
require authorizations, peer review, quality assurance documentation, ticket matching of changes to work authorizations and overall change
controls. It is our belief that these added controls and related actions will effectively remediate the existing material weaknesses.
The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of
time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Other
than the remediation actions described above, there
were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
