 million, net of million of cash acquired. Prior to the Fanatec acquisition, another of our subsidiaries, Corsair Components Ltd CCL ), entered into a Bridge Loan Agreement Bridge Loan in May 2024 and a Debtor-In-Possession Loan Agreement DIP Loan in September 2024 with Endor to provide short-term financing for Endor's operations in connection with our intent to acquire the Fanatec Business through a German restructuring process. Pursuant to the terms of the APA, the total principal and interest owed by Endor to CCL as of the Fanatec Acquisition Date for the Bridge Loan and DIP Loan of approximately million, in aggregate, was set-off against the purchase price, and accordingly, on the Fanatec Acquisition Date, GmbH paid CCL million cash to settle the Bridge Loan and DIP Loan (including interest of million) on behalf of Endor. GmbH paid the remaining million purchase consideration to Endor in cash on the Fanatec Acquisition Date. Because the Fanatec acquisition met the definition of a business, it has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Fanatec s results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations with effect from September 19, 2024. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Fanatec Acquisition Date. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized consist of income tax and indirect tax considerations and the validation of certain inventory values, accounts payables and accrued liabilities. We will continue to reflect measurement period adjustments to purchase price allocation, if any, in the period in which the adjustments are recognized.

million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, upon the sale of the acquired inventory. The goodwill of million represents the expansion of our market presence by utilizing Fanatec's strength and brand in the sim racing market. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes and is assigned to our Peripherals reporting unit. The million identifiable intangible assets acquired include trade name of million and product technology of million. The fair values of the identified intangible assets were estimated primarily using the income approach and were based on inputs that are not observable in the market which we consider to be Level 3 inputs. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from to years, using the straight-line method of amortization. The identifiable intangible assets acquired are deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition-related costs incurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively, and these amounts are primarily reported within sales and general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

On January 29, 2024, in connection with a joint release letter executed between us and Drop's seller, we received a refund of million from escrow funds in relation to a purchase price adjustment for net working capital. With this refund, total purchase consideration, net of cash acquired, decreased to million. Drop, a community-based e-commerce company was headquartered in San Francisco, California, and specialized in customized DIY keyboards and keycaps. We expect this acquisition to give Corsair a leading presence in the personalized keyboards market which is one of the fastest growing trends in the gaming peripherals space as well as allow us to offer specialized Corsair and Elgato products to the enthusiast community that Drop is engaged with.

million. As of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023, we had million unused capacity under the Revolving Facility. The Credit Agreement has a variable rate structure. According to the provisions in the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement Third Amendment ), beginning 2024, the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility carry interest at our election at either (a) Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate BSBY plus a percentage spread (ranging from to based on our total net leverage ratio, or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement as the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus and (iii) one-month BSBY plus plus a percentage spread (ranging from to based on our total net leverage ratio. Additionally, the commitment fees on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility ranges from to based on our total net leverage ratio. On August 19, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provides for, among other things, (i) effectuates the transition of the underlying variable interest rate from the BSBY to a forward-looking interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), with no change to the applicable margin percentage spread, but with the addition of a rate spread adjustment in the amount of per annum, (ii) increases the letter of credit sublimit from million to million and (iii) the issuance of letters of credit denominated in Euro. The effective interest rate of our Term Loan, inclusive of the debt discount and debt issuance costs, was approximately and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and was approximately and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains covenants with which we must comply during the term of the agreement, which we believe are ordinary and standard for agreements of this nature, including the maintenance of a maximum Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio CTNL Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio CIC Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). According to the provisions in the Third Amendment, beginning 2024, we are required to maintain a maximum CTNL Ratio of to 1.00 and a minimum CIC ratio of to 1.00, with the provision that the maximum CTNL Ratio can be temporarily increased to to 1.00 upon the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in, and subject to the requirements of the Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, we were not in default under the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries and secured by a security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions detailed in the Credit Agreement and related ancillary documentation.

Letters of Credit There were letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. amounts have been drawn upon the letters of credit for all periods presented. Legal Proceedings We may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of business. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations, and the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred and we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that existing claims or proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, or the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on our operations or financial position, liquidity of results of operations. Indemnification In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms with respect to certain transactions. We have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require Corsair, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon Corsair to provide indemnification under such agreements, and thus, there are claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, or statements of cash flows. We currently have directors and officers insurance .

The compensation expense associated with PSUs is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, and it is based on the estimated number of shares that is considered probable of vesting. Adjustments to the compensation expense will be made in each reporting period based on changes in our estimate of the number of PSUs that are probable of vesting. We measure and recognize compensation for all stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock units RSU and PSU, based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards. The grant-date fair value of our stock options and stock purchase rights is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of our RSUs and PSUs are calculated based on the market value of our stock at the grant date.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to United States income, the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, changes in geographic mix of income and expense, changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. We assess our deferred tax assets and liabilities to determine if it is more likely than not they will be realized; if not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have reached a cumulative loss position over the previous three years, and with consideration of other negative evidence, we concluded that U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realizable. As a result of the foregoing, a full valuation allowance was recorded in the current quarter. The deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived assets was excluded from sources of future taxable income, as the timing of its reversal cannot be predicted due to the nature of its indefinite life. Our effective tax rates were tax expense of and tax benefit of for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The change in our effective rate in the three-month period was primarily due to an income tax provision of million for valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, partially offset by a tax benefit recognized for the transfer of customer relationship intangible asset from Hong Kong to United Kingdom as a result of our global tax restructuring initiative completed on July 1, 2024. Our effective tax rates were tax expense of and tax benefit of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The change in our effective rate in the nine-month period was primarily due to a change in the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, an income tax provision of million for valuation allowance recorded

million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023, respectively, and if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. On December 15, 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation, including United Kingdom which approved the legislation on July 11, 2023 with a full effective date of January 1, 2024. We have evaluated the potential impact from the OECD Pillar Two rules and determined that there is no impact to our financial position for the year 2024.

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, represented and interest in Elgato iDisplay Holdings LTD. and its related companies (together iDisplay ), respectively, that were not acquired by Corsair. In addition, we have nonredeemable noncontrolling interest Non-RNCI in iDisplay recorded at carrying value which do not have redemption features and are classified within permanent equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheet of million as of December 31, 2024, representing interest in iDisplay not acquired by Corsair. We do t have any Non-RNCI outstanding at September 30, 2024. RNCI that is redeemable and not solely within our control is classified within temporary equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. RNCI is measured at the greater of the redemption value, or the carrying value before giving effect to the redemption feature. The redemption value is calculated based on the formula stipulated in the Shareholders Agreement between the iDisplay Seller and Corsair and including the amounts for dividends not currently declared or paid, for which the payment is not solely within our control. The redemption value is remeasured each quarter and changes in the value are recognized immediately. Any resulting change in the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized through retained earnings and this adjustment also impacts the net income or loss attributable to common stockholders of Corsair Gaming, Inc used in the net income (loss) per share calculation. On January 1, 2022, we acquired a controlling interest in iDisplay and entered into a Shareholders Agreement (the SHA with the iDisplay Seller which provided a put option to the iDisplay Seller to sell and a call option for us to purchase up to of the remaining interests in iDisplay. The exercise price of the put and call option under the SHA is based on certain prescribed multiples of iDisplay s historical TTM EBITDA less any debt. Corsair and the iDisplay Seller did not exercise their call or put option under the SHA, but instead on (the Execution Date ), Corsair entered into a Share Purchase Amendment Agreement (the SPAA with the iDisplay Seller to purchase an additional ownership stake in iDisplay for a cash consideration of million (the Additional Purchase Transaction ). The closing conditions of the SPAA were completed on (the Closing Date along with our payment of the cash consideration. As a result, our total ownership stake in iDisplay increased from to , and correspondingly, iDisplay Seller's ownership interest in iDisplay decreased from to . The SPAA also replaced the call option and put option in the SHA with new options. Under the SPAA, a put option (the Put Option was provided to the iDisplay Seller to sell up to of the remaining ownership interest in iDisplay to Corsair within one year after the fifth anniversary date of the Execution Date, and a call option (the Call Option was provided to Corsair to purchase up to of the remaining ownership interest in iDisplay at any time after the second anniversary of the Execution Date. The exercise price of the Put Option and Call Option remain the same as the terms defined in the SHA. In addition, if the founder of iDisplay ceases to serve as the manager of iDisplay, voluntarily or with cause, we are entitled to an irrevocable call option to purchase up to ownership interest in iDisplay at any time during the after the Execution Date and the exercise price is based on a prescribed multiple of TTM EBITDA. According to the applicable accounting guidance, purchase of noncontrolling interest that does not result in a change in control of the subsidiary is accounted for as equity transaction.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in conjunction with the Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 27, 2024. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those discussed under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

On September 19, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the Fanatec Business for a purchase consideration of 43.7 million. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations-Fanatec Acquisition for more information on this transaction. The Fanatec sim racing product line, which fully complements our sim racing chassis, gaming PCs, gaming and streaming peripherals, and monitors, will expand our product offerings in these markets. Fanatec s results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations with effect from September 19, 2024. 
 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 Our net revenue was 304.2 million and 363.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our gross margin was 22.9 and 24.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had a net loss of 51.6 million and 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and restricted cash, in the aggregate of 61.6 million and the principal balance outstanding on our Term Loan was 177.8 million. Cash used in operations was 19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and cash provided by operations was 32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Business 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, including those discussed under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and those described below. 
 Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. We continue to face global macroeconomic challenges including the ongoing effects of geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing war between Russia and 
 Corsair Gaming, Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 22 

Table of Contents 

Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, including the heightened tensions in the Red Sea, and any potential conflicts between China and Taiwan, supply chain constraints, uncertainty in key financial markets and the risk of a recession, inflationary trends, volatility in exchange rates and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment. We also experience seasonality in the sale of our products, which may be affected by general economic conditions. The extent of the impact of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are not within our control and are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We will continue to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and further our mitigation plans. 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result of our foreign sales and operations, we have revenue, payroll and other operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies, in particular the Chinese Yuan, Euro and British Pound. Unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the currencies we conduct sales or operate in may negatively impact our financial results. While the foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact to our operating results for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, there can be no assurance that future foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material impact to our operating results. 
 Impact of Industry Trends 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are impacted by industry trends in the gaming market, including: 
 Increasing gaming engagement. We believe that gaming s increasing time share of global entertainment consumption will drive continued growth in spending on both games and gaming products. Gaming continues to become increasingly social, as streaming viewership becomes more widely adopted along with increasing numbers of content creators. More members of the younger generation are gamers and spend more time on gaming related activities than older generations. We believe these trends will over time bring more gamers and creators to purchase dedicated hardware and help grow the market for peripheral products. The growth of these markets will not be linear, as these markets are impacted by macro-economic and consumer confidence conditions, amongst other conditions. Our Gaming Components and Systems segment makes components used for self-built PCs and full gaming systems. The self-built PC market is heavily influenced by the timing of release of new game titles and next-gen CPUs and GPUs, as discussed in the bullet below. As for the peripherals market, during the first nine months of 2024, our Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment benefited from a slight improvement in the peripherals market compared to the same period last year. We were also able to increase our sales in this segment through expanding our product offerings by adding new products such as our teleprompter offerings, new PC controllers and mobile controllers, and several new keyboards. We expect this trend in peripheral market improvement and expansion to continue into late 2024 and in 2025. 

Introduction of new high-performance computing hardware and sophisticated games . We believe that the introduction of more powerful CPUs and GPUs that place increased demands on other system components, such as memory, power supply or cooling, has a significant effect on increasing the demand for our products. In addition, we believe that the introduction and success of games with sophisticated graphics that place increasing demands on system processing speed and capacity and therefore require more powerful CPUs or GPUs, drives demand for our high-performance gaming components and systems, such as PSUs and cooling solutions, and our gaming PC memory. As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by the timing of, and the rate at which computer hardware companies introduce, new and enhanced CPUs and GPUs, the timing of, and rate at which computer game companies and developers introduce sophisticated new and improved games that require increasingly high levels of system and graphics processing power, and whether these new products and games are widely accepted by gamers. During 2023, we experienced overall demand increase for our gaming components and systems products primarily driven by the self-built PC market expansion from the increase in availability in late 2022 of new and reasonably priced GPUs and CPUs as well as the release of new game titles. In 2024, we are mid-cycle for new GPU platforms, and as a result, we do not expect a similar increase in demand driven by these new GPU platforms and some highly anticipated game title releases until the next substantial GPU launch which is now expected in early 2025. The slowdown in the self-built PC market activity in the first nine months of 2024, led to a decrease in demand for our products in the Gaming Components and Systems segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Impact of Customer Concentration 
 We operate a global sales network that consists primarily of retailers (including e-retailers), as well as distributors we use to access certain retailers. Further, a limited number of retailers and distributors represent a significant portion of our net revenue, with e-retailer Amazon accounting for 31.5 and 29.2 of our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and sales to our ten largest customers accounting for approximately 53.4 and 54.9 of our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our customers, including Amazon, typically do not enter into long-term agreements to purchase our products but instead enter into purchase orders with us. As a result of this concentration and the lack of long-term agreements with our customers, a primary driver of our net revenue and operating performance is maintaining good relationships with these retailers and distributors. To help maintain good relationships, we implement initiatives such as our updated packaging design which helps e-retailers such as Amazon process our packages more efficiently. Further, given our global operations, a significant percentage of our expenses relate to shipping costs. Our ability to effectively optimize these shipping costs, for example 
 Corsair Gaming, Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 23 

Table of Contents 

utilizing expensive shipping options such as air freight for smaller packages and more urgent deliveries and more cost-efficient options, such as ground or ocean freight, for other shipments, has an impact on our expenses and results of operations. 
 Impact of New Product Introductions 
 Gamers demand new technology and product features, and we expect our ability to accurately anticipate and meet these demands will be one of the main drivers for any future sales growth and market share expansion. We have continued to enter new markets both through acquisitions, for example the sim racing market from the Fanatec Acquisition, and through extending our product lines. We launched 108 and 65 new products in 2023 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. While we intend to continue to develop and release new products, there can be no assurance that our new product introductions will have a favorable impact on our operating results or that customers will choose our new products over those of our competitors. 
 Impact of Seasonal Sales Trends 
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in sales due to the buying patterns of our customers and spending patterns of gamers. Our net revenue has generally been lower in the first and second calendar quarters due to lower consumer demand following the fourth quarter holiday season and because of the decline in sales that typically occurs in anticipation of the introduction of new or enhanced CPUs, GPUs, and other computer hardware products, which usually take place in the second calendar quarter, and which tend to drive sales in the following two quarters. Further, our net revenue tends to be higher in the third and fourth calendar quarters due to seasonal sales such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday as well as Singles Day in China, as retailers tend to make purchases in advance of these sales. Our sales also tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to the introduction of new consoles and high-profile games in connection with the holiday season. As a consequence of seasonality, our net revenue for the second calendar quarter is generally the lowest of the year followed by the first calendar quarter. Historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and may be further impacted in the future, by macroeconomic factors, increasing supply constraints, GPU shortages, and shifts in customer behavior. For example, our revenue seasonality for the third quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted due to a lower demand for our products in the Gaming Components and Systems segment which was primarily attributable to the push out of the launch of new, reasonably priced GPUs and CPUs, as well as the release of new game titles to early 2025. 
 Impact of Product Mix 
 Our Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment has a higher gross margin than our Gaming Components and Systems segment. As a result, our overall gross margin is affected by changes in product mix. External factors can have an impact on our product mix, such as popular game releases that can increase sales of peripherals and availability of new CPUs and GPUs that can impact component sales. In addition, within our Gamer and Creator Peripherals and Gaming Components and Systems segments, gross margin varies between products, and significant shifts in product mix within either segment may also significantly impact our overall gross margin. 
 Impact of Fluctuations in Integrated Circuits Pricing 
 Integrated circuits, or ICs, account for most of the cost of producing our high-performance memory products. IC prices are subject to pricing fluctuations which can affect the average sales prices of memory modules, and thus impact our net revenue, and can have an effect on gross margins. The impact on net revenues can be significant as our high-performance memory products, included within our Gaming Components and Systems segment, represent a significant portion of our net revenue. 
 Components of our Operating Results 
 Net Revenue 
 We generate materially all of our net revenue from the sale of gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems to retailers, including e-retailers, gamers and distributors worldwide. Our revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, discounts, sales incentives and any taxes collected from customers. 
 Cost of Revenue

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of sales, general and administrative expenses and product development expenses. 
 Sales, general and administrative. Sales, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist of distribution costs, sales, marketing and other general and administrative costs. Distribution costs include outbound freight and the costs to operate our distribution hubs. Sales and marketing costs relate to the costs to operate our global sales force that works in conjunction with our channel partners, gaming team and event sponsorships, advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services, costs of maintaining our web store and credit card processing fees related to sales on our webstore, personnel-related cost and allocated overhead costs. General and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, IT and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services related to these functions and allocated overhead costs. 
 Product development . Product development costs are generally expensed as incurred. Product development costs consist primarily of the costs associated with the design and testing of new products and improvements to existing products. These costs relate primarily to compensation of personnel and consultants involved with product design, definition, compatibility testing and qualification, as well as depreciation costs of equipment used, prototype material costs and allocated overhead costs. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest associated with our debt financing arrangements, including our revolving line of credit, and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on interest-bearing bank deposits and interest-bearing Bridge Loan, net of amortization of Bridge Loan origination costs. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other expense, net consists primarily of our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relating to transactions and remeasurement of asset and liability balances denominated in foreign currencies, and net fair value gains and losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to United States income, the utilization of foreign tax credits and changes in tax laws. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance, if, based upon available evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the share of the net income of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100 of the equity attributable to the ownership interest that we did not acquire.

Higher spending on promotional activities as a proportion of net revenue resulted in a 1.8 decrease in gross margin, while higher product costs from suppliers and factory underutilization accounted for 1.7 of the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 1.7 in gross margin from an improved product mix shift with more sales in the Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment. 
 Gross margin decreased by 0.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year. Higher spending on promotional activities as a proportion of net revenue accounted for 1.3 of the decrease, and higher inventory reserves accounted for 0.7 of the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 1.5 in gross margin from an improved product mix shift with more sales in the Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment.

SG A expenses remained relatively consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year with a 1.5 million increase in distribution costs and a 0.5 million increase in professional fees being largely offset by lower bonus payments and marketing spend. 
 SG A expenses increased by 13.2 million, or 6.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year primarily due to a 8.4 million increase in legal expense, which were mainly attributable to a one-time settlement and the Fanatec Acquisition, as well as a 3.7 million increase in distribution costs, which was largely attributable to rationalization costs for distribution hubs, as well as increased freight costs.

Interest expense decreased by 29.5 and 22.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower principal balance on our Term Loan combined with lower interest rates on our Term Loan in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest income decreased by 83.0 and 41.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year primarily due to lower cash balance in our interest-bearing account. 
 Other expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign exchange gains and losses on cash, accounts receivable and intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily driven by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchanges rates of the Euro, British Pound and the Chinese Yuan.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to United States income, the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, changes in geographic mix of income and expense, changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. 
 We assess our deferred tax assets and liabilities to determine if it is more likely than not they will be realized; if not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have reached a cumulative loss position over the previous three years, and with consideration of other negative evidence, we concluded that U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realizable. As a result of the foregoing, a full valuation allowance was recorded in the current quarter. The deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived assets was excluded from sources of future taxable income, as the timing of its reversal cannot be predicted due to the nature of its indefinite life. 
 Our effective tax rates were tax expense of (110.0) and tax benefit of 3.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in our effective rate in the three-month period was primarily due to an income tax provision of 28.0 million for valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, partially offset by a tax benefit recognized for the transfer of customer relationship intangible asset from Hong Kong to United Kingdom as a result of our global tax restructuring initiative completed on July 1, 2024. 
 Our effective tax rates were tax expense of (32.7) and tax benefit of 26.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in our effective rate in the nine-month period was primarily due to a change in the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, an income tax provision of 28.0 million for valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, partially offset by a tax benefit recognized for the transfer of customer relationship intangible asset from Hong Kong to United Kingdom as a result of our global tax restructuring initiative completed on July 1, 2024. 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation, including United Kingdom which approved the legislation on July 11, 2023 with a full effective date of January 1, 2024. We have evaluated the potential impact from the OECD Pillar Two rules and determined that there is no impact to our financial position for the year of 2024.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals Segment 
 Net revenue of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment increased by 12.8 and 17.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. The increase was primarily driven by the success of recent new product launches, increased demand for most of the products in this segment and the inclusion of post-acquisition revenues from our July 2023 acquisition of Drop, a community-based e-commerce company. 
 Gaming Components and Systems Segment 
 Net revenue of the Gaming Components and Systems segment decreased 25.9 and 23.6 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. The demand for our products in this segment is largely driven by the activity in the self-built PC market, which is heavily influenced by the launch of new, reasonably priced GPUs and CPUs, as well as the release of new game titles. However, in 2024, we are mid-cycle for new GPU platforms, resulting in a relatively flat-to-low market trajectory for the self-built PC market since the beginning of the year. This has led to a greater than anticipated decrease in demand for our products in this segment during both the three- and nine-month periods. Additionally, we experienced a downward adjustment in inventory levels at our channel partners during the three- and nine-month periods compared to an increase in channel inventory levels during the same periods last year, contributing to the lower net revenues for those periods.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals Segment 
 The gross margin of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment increased by 5.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 4.2 increase from a more favorable product mix within this segment and lower product costs from suppliers and successful launches of new products with higher average margins, and a 2.2 increase due to lower costs to process inventory returns in the three months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a 1.0 decrease due to higher spending on promotional activities as a proportion of net revenue. 
 The gross margin of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment increased by 7.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 4.7 increase from a more favorable product mix within this segment and lower product costs from suppliers and successful launches of new products with higher average margins, a 2.3 increase from lower inventory reserve, and a 1.1 increase due to lower costs to process inventory returns. These increases were partially offset by a 0.9 decrease due to higher air freight costs.

Gaming Components and Systems Segment 
 The gross margin of the Gaming Components and Systems segment decreased by 6.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 2.3 decrease from an unfavorable product mix within this segment and pricing pressures from market competition, a 2.2 decrease from increased promotional activities as a proportion of net revenue, and a 2.2 decrease from higher inventory reserves. 
 The gross margin of the Gaming Components and Systems segment decreased by 5.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period last year.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have financed our operations and acquisitions through cash from operations, and when applicable, through debt facilities and issuance of equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and restricted cash, in aggregate of 61.6 million, and our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) of 100.0 million. 
 We have a shelf-registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC, which allows us to offer securities, including common stock, preferred stock and warrants, through August 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, 216.7 million remained available for issuance under the shelf-registration statement. 
 Our principal uses of cash generally include purchases of inventory, payroll and other operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our products, capital expenditure, repayments of debt and related interest, income tax payments, future investments in business and technology, and selective mergers and acquisitions. 
 We believe that the anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash balances at September 30, 2024, supplemented with the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Facility, if and as needed, will be sufficient to fund our principal uses of cash for at least the next twelve months. In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on the demand for our products. We may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that any such equity or debt financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.7 million and consisted of a net loss of 86.1 million and a net cash outflow of 10.3 million from changes in our net operating assets and liabilities, offset partially by non-cash adjustments of 76.8 million. The net cash outflow from changes in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments and a decrease in other liabilities and accrued expenses mainly due to a reduction in the accruals needed for sales returns and customer incentives with lower revenues, and lower bonus, as well as an increase in inventories as we ramp up for year-end sales. These net cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable from lower revenue. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of amortization of intangibles, depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, as well as changes in deferred income taxes. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 32.1 million and consisted of non-cash adjustments of 56.0 million, offset partially by a net loss of 8.6 million and a net cash outflow of 15.4 million from changes in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of amortization, depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, which were partially offset by changes in deferred income taxes. The net cash outflow from

Table of Contents 

changes in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable from timing of receipts and an increase in inventories due to higher purchases. These net cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of 43.1 million cash used for the Fanatec Acquisition (refer to Note 5, Business Combinations for more information on the Fanatec Acquisition), 8.4 million of capital expenditure, partially offset by 1.0 million cash received from escrow for the purchase price adjustment related to the Drop Acquisition. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of 14.2 million cash used for the Drop Acquisition and 10.8 million of capital expenditure primarily for equipment and software. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 46.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of 21.3 million repayment of debt, 19.8 million purchase of additional ownership interest in iDisplay (refer to Note 15, "Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest" for more information on the additional ownership interest purchase), 4.9 million settlement of deferred consideration related to a prior business acquisition in 2019, 5.2 million payment of dividends to noncontrolling interest, and 0.6 million payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by 5.1 million proceeds received from the issuance of shares through the employee equity incentive plans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 21.5 million from our Revolving Facility to fund our operations and the full amount was repaid within the same period. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily consisted of 16.3 million repayment of debt, 1.3 million payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, as well as 1.0 million payment of dividends to noncontrolling interest, which were partially offset by 6.8 million proceeds received from the issuance of shares through the employee equity incentive plans. We did not borrow from our Revolving Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital Resources 
 On September 3, 2021, we refinanced the First Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a new Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a total commitment of 350.0 million, consisting of a 100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and a 250.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan ). The Credit Agreement is available for a period of five years, maturing September 2026, and provides for additional incremental facilities up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 250.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We may prepay the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility at any time without premium or penalty. We prepaid 11.9 million and 34.1 million of the Term Loan principal in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal outstanding of the Term Loan was 177.8 million and the available and uncommitted capacity under the Revolving Facility was 100 million. 
 The Credit Agreement has a variable rate structure. According to the provisions in the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement Third Amendment ), beginning 2024, the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility carry interest at our election at either (a) Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate BSBY plus a percentage spread (ranging from 1.25 to 2.25 based on our total net leverage ratio, or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement as the greatest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 and (iii) one-month BSBY plus 1.0 plus a percentage spread (ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 based on our total net leverage ratio. Additionally, the commitment fees on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 based on our total net leverage ratio. 
 On August 19, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provides for, among other things, (i) effectuates the transition of the underlying variable interest rate from the BSBY to a forward-looking interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), with no change to the applicable margin percentage spread, but with the addition of a rate spread adjustment in the amount of 0.10 per annum, (ii) increases the letter of credit sublimit from 15 million to 65 million and (iii) the issuance of letters of credit denominated in Euro. 
 The Credit Agreement contains covenants with which we must comply during the term of the agreement, which we believe are ordinary and standard for agreements of this nature, including the maintenance of a maximum Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio CTNL Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio CIC Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). According to the provisions in the Third Amendment, beginning 2024, we are required to maintain a maximum CTNL Ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a minimum CIC ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, with the provision that the maximum CTNL Ratio can be temporarily increased to 3.50 to 1.00

(1) Amounts represent the principal cash payments as of September 30, 2024 of our Term Loan based on the repayment schedule according to the Credit Agreement and the expected interest payments associated with the Term Loan. See Note 8, Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.

As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.5 million in non-current income tax payable, including interest and penalties, related to our income tax liability for uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the contractual cash obligation table above. 
 Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates 
 A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), which requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and restricted cash of 61.6 million, which consisted primarily of bank deposits. Our cash is held for working capital purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, under the Credit Agreement, we had 177.8 million Term Loan outstanding (face value), and the Term Loan bears variable market rates, primarily SOFR, effective from September 2024. See Note 8, Debt - Credit Agreement to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Credit Agreement. A significant change in these market rates may adversely affect our operating results. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a change to annual interest expense by approximately 1.7 million. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Approximately 20.2 of our net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Euro, and to a lesser extent, the British Pound. Any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign countries could have an adverse impact on our net revenue and gross margins as we may have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures if there is significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily in the United States, Europe, China and Taiwan. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 We enter into forward currency contracts to reduce the short-term effects of currency fluctuations on Euro, British Pound, and Chinese Yuan denominated cash, accounts receivable, and intercompany receivable and payable balances. These forward contracts generally mature within two to four months, and we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes. The outstanding notional principal amount was 19.5 million and 44.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The gains or losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings based on the changes in fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts. 
 The impact of changes in foreign currency rates, including the gains or (losses) on the forward currency contracts, recognized in other expense, net was (1.9) million and (1.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A hypothetical ten percent change in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar would increase or decrease our gains or losses on foreign currency exchange of approximately 3.1 million in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but there can be no assurance that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We may from time to time be involved in various legal proceedings of a character normally incident to the ordinary course of our business. Although the outcome of any pending matters, and the amount, if any, of our ultimate liability and any other forms of remedies with respect to these matters, cannot be determined or predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 We have disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed.

The parties hereto 
 65 

expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the L/C Issuer (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination, and that:

 (ii)the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and without regard to any non-documentary condition in such Letter of Credit; 
 (iii)the L/C Issuer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and

 Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of (A) any presentation that includes forged or fraudulent documents or that is otherwise affected by the fraudulent, bad faith, or illegal conduct of the beneficiary or other Person, (B) the L/C Issuer declining to take-up documents and make payment, (C) against documents that are fraudulent, forged, or for other reasons by which that it is entitled not to honor, (D) following a Borrower s waiver of discrepancies with respect to such documents or request for honor of such documents or (E) the L/C Issuer retaining proceeds of a Letter of Credit based on an apparently applicable attachment order, blocking regulation, or third-party claim notified to the L/C Issuer. 
 (j)	 Applicability of ISP . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued by it, the rules of the ISP shall apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the L/C Issuer s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 
 (k)	 Benefits . The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of 
 66 

Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 
 (l)	 Letter of Credit Fees . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any standby Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06 . Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) payable on the first Business Day following the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (ii) accrued through and including the last day of each calendar quarter in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
 (m)	 Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer . At any time there is more than one Lender, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum equal to the percentage separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the L/C Issuer, computed on the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable no later than the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in the most recently- ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Maturity Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06 . In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 
 (n)	 Disbursement Procedures . The L/C Issuer for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by Applicable Laws or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. The L/C Issuer shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of such demand for payment if the L/C Issuer has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer and the Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. 
 (o)	 Interim Interest . If the L/C Issuer for any standby Letter of Credit shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans; provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such L/C Disbursement when due pursuant to clause (f of this Section 2.03 , then Section 2.08(b shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this 
 67 

clause (p shall be for account of the L/C Issuer, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to clause (f of this Section 2.03 to reimburse the L/C Issuer shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (p)	 Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse, indemnify and compensate the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the Borrower. The Borrower irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
 (q)	 Conflict with Issuer Documents . In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 
 2.04 	 Swingline Loans.

Each such Swingline Loan may be made, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to the Borrower, in Dollars, from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swingline Sublimit; provided , however , that (i) after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility at such time, and (B) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender at such time shall not exceed such Lender s Revolving Commitment, (ii) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan, and (iii) the Swingline Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swingline Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04 , prepay under Section 2.05 , and reborrow under this Section 2.04 . Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest only at a rate based on the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan. 
 (b)	 Borrowing Procedures . 
 Each Swingline Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by: (ii) telephone or (iii) a Swingline Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swingline Loan Notice. Each such Swingline Loan Notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (A) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of 100,000, and (B) the requested date of the Borrowing (which shall be a 
 68 

Business Day). Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing (1) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a ), or (2) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swingline Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Borrower at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swingline Lender in immediately available funds. 
 (c)	 Refinancing of Swingline Loans . 
 (i)	The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02 , without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 . The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii ), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. 
 (ii)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i (including, without limitation, the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 ), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
 (iii)	If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i ), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender 
 69 

(acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c)(iii shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (iv)	Each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (d)	 Repayment of Participations . 
 (i)	At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender. 
 (ii)	If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 (e)	 Interest for Account of Swingline Lender . The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Revolving Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender. 
 70

For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the Revolving Facility for purposes of determining the commitment fee.

 (a)	 Computation of Interest and Fees . All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the BSBY Rate Term SOFR shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365 day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a ), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 (b)	 Financial Statement Adjustments or Restatements . If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or for any other reason, the Borrower, or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper 
 76 

calculation of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This clause (b shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under any provision of this Agreement to payment of any Obligations hereunder at the Default Rate or under Article VIII .

 (a)	 Maintenance of Accounts . The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender in the ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in accordance with Section 11.06(c ). The accounts or records maintained by each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
 (b)	 Maintenance of Records . In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a ), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans.

 2.12 	 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent s Clawback. 
 (a)	 General . All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 
 77 

Subject to Section 2.07(a and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
 (b)	(i)	 Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of BSBY Rate Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii)	 Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this clause (b shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 78 

(c)	 Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (d)	 Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c ). 
 (e)	 Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (f)	 Pro Rata Treatment . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing (other than Swingline Borrowings) shall be made from the Appropriate Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.09 and clauses (l) and (m) of Section 2.03 shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Appropriate Lenders. 
 2.13 	 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . 
 If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the 
 79 

Lenders at such time, then, in each case under clauses (a and b above, the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and sub-participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facilities then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that: 
 (i)	if any such participations or sub-participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or sub-participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
 (ii)	the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender or Disqualified Institution), (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.14 , or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or sub-participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall apply). 
 Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to Section 2.15(a)(v ), after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(v and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).

Subject to Section 11.20 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 (v)	 Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans .

 (i)	adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR including, without limitation, because the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 
 (ii)	 Bloomberg CME or any successor administrator of the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or Bloomberg or such administrator with respect to its publication of BSBY Term SOFR , in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR or the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such representative interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of BSBY Term SOFR or the BSBY Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date ); 
 then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the B SBY Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date Interest Payment Date , as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, BSBY Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with , subject to the proviso below, the first available alternative set forth in the order below Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate : .

 (y) Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment; 
 provided that, if initially BSBY is replaced with the rate contained in clause (y) above (Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment) and subsequent to such replacement, the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR has become available and is administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and each Lender of such availability, then from and after the beginning of the Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, in each case, commencing no less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, the Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment.

For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments , shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guaranteed Obligations shall include any such indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities, or portion thereof, which may be or hereafter become unenforceable or compromised or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against any debtor under any Debtor Relief Laws. The Administrative Agent s books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Secured Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Secured Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Secured Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Secured Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantors, or any of them, under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 
 136 

10.02 	 Rights of Lenders.

 No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Secured Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated.

The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.11 shall remain in full force and effect until the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Each Loan Party intends this Section 10.11 to constitute, and this Section 10.11 shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.
