by SEER, and PelleChar is owned by SEER. 

PWS
developed specific opportunities to deploy and commercialize patented technologies for a non-thermal plasma-assisted oxidation process
that makes possible the clean and efficient destruction of solid hazardous chemical and biological waste i.e ., regulated medical
waste, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and refinery tank waste, etc .) without landfilling or traditional incineration and without harmful
emissions. Additionally, this technology cleans and conditions emissions and gaseous waste streams i.e ., volatile
organic compounds and other greenhouse gases) generated from diverse sources such as refineries, oil fields, and many others. In July
2022, the Company exchanged its patents and related technology, to its joint venture, Paragon Southwest Medical Waste PSMW ),
in exchange for units in PSMW. (See Note 9) 

PelleChar
was established in September 2018 and is owned by SEER. Pellechar has secured third-party pellet manufacturing capabilities from
one of the nation s premier pellet manufacturers. Working closely with Biochar Now, LLC, Pellechar commenced sales in late 2019
of its proprietary pellets containing the proven and superior Biochar Now product starting with the landscaping and big agriculture markets.
At this time, Pellechar is the only company able to offer a soil amendment pellet containing the Biochar Now product that is produced
using the patented pyrolytic process. 

Principals
of Consolidation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SEER, its wholly owned subsidiaries, SEM, and MV, and its majority-owned
subsidiaries PWS and PelleChar, since their respective acquisition or formation dates. All material intercompany accounts, transactions,
and profits have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has non-controlling interest in joint ventures, which are reported on
the equity method. 

Going
Concern 

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit
of approximately million as of September 30, 2024, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss from
continuing operations of approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by
approximately million. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue to operate as a going
concern. 

Realization
of a major portion of the Company s assets as of September 30, 2024, is dependent upon continued operations. The Company is dependent
on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately million from the issuance of short-term and long-term debt, offset by
payments of principal on short term notes of million, for a net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million.
In addition, the Company has undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. The Company continues to
focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing,
aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be the ability to license and or sell, permit
and operate through the Company s joint ventures. The Company has increased business development efforts to address opportunities
identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations. In addition,
the Company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure
additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from
operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company
be unable to report on a going concern basis. 

Basis
of Presentation Unaudited Interim Financial Information 

The
accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position
and results of operations as of and for the periods presented. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year or any future period. 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC ). The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the interim information presented
not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Report on Form 10-K filed on April 16, 2024, for the year ended December
31, 2023.

adjustments for uncertain tax positions. 

The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions were recognized as of September 30, 2024, and 2023. The Company expects no material changes to unrecognized

The
Company has filed federal and state tax returns through December 31, 2023. The tax periods for the years ending December 31, 2021, through
2023 are open to examination by federal and state authorities.

in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to
date and are recognized as a current asset. Revenue contract liabilities represent the excess of billings to date over the amount of
contract costs and profits recognized to date and are recognized as a current liability.

to years, and often
include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from year to month-to-month and are included in
the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in Right
of use assets on the Company s September 30, 2024, Consolidated Balance Sheets and represent the Company s right to
use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company s obligation to make lease payments are included in Current portion
of lease liabilities and Lease liabilities net of current portion on the Company s September 30, 2024, Consolidated
Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, total right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities were approximately and ,
respectively. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately in operating lease costs for right-of-use assets. 

Because
the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present
value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which
it has elected to treat as a single lease component.

the further development and construction of various prototypes and commercial waste destruction units. No members of PWS have made capital
contributions or other funding to PWS other than SEER. The intent of the operating agreement is to provide the funding as an advance
against future earnings distributions made by PWS. 

Paragon
Southwest Medical Waste 

On
July 20, 2022, PWS transferred all patents owned covering medical waste destruction, and related technology, to its joint venture, Paragon
Southwest Medical Waste PSMW ), in exchange for units in PSMW. The units in PSMW transferred in connection with this transaction
increased SEER s equity in PSMW to approximately , on a total consolidated basis, and SEER was granted back an international
license to use the patented technology in any territory outside of North America. This transaction also canceled the irrevocable license
and royalty agreement, and the management agreement between PWS and PSMW. 

On
June 30, 2023, the Company exchanged its interest in PSMW in exchange for a interest in Amlon Holdings when PSWM was acquired by Amlon

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of our operations. It should be read in
conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report as well as
our Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2024. Certain statements made in our discussion
may be forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results
or outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, the risks
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other risks described in this
Quarterly Report. Unless the context requires otherwise, when we refer to we, us and our, we
are describing Strategic Environmental Energy Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

SEER
BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

Strategic
Environmental Energy Resources, Inc. the Company or SEER was originally organized under the laws
of the State of Nevada on February 13, 2002, for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses under the name of Satellite Organizing
Solutions, Inc. SOZG ). In January 2008, SOZG changed its name to Strategic Environmental Energy Resources, Inc.
SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that provide safe, innovative, cost-effective,
and profitable solutions in the environmental, waste management, and renewable energy industries. SEER currently operates four companies
with its headquarters in Broomfield, Colorado. Through its operating companies, SEER provides environmental products and solutions throughout
North America and is pursuing international markets for its technologies and products. SEER s operating companies are discussed
in more detail below. 

The
Company s domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER s subsidiaries that have well-established revenue streams
and, simultaneously, establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for
renewable energy, waste management/treatment, emissions capture and conditioning, and environmental soil amendments and organic fertilizers.
The focus of the SEER family of companies, however, is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patent-pending
technologies and then leveraging its 25-plus-year service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets
of renewable biogas, emission capture and control, renewable green gas capture and sale, organic soil amendments and fertilizers,
as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical waste destruction. Many of SEER s current operating companies share customer
bases and each provides synergistic services, technologies and products. 

Subsidiaries 

Wholly
owned 

MV,
LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies), MV : (operating since 2003) MV designs and sells patented and/or proprietary,
dry scrubber solutions for management of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) in biogas, landfill gas, and petroleum processing operations. These system
solutions are marketed under the product names H2SPlus and OdorFilter . The markets for these products include landfill
operations, agricultural and food product processors, wastewater treatment facilities, and petroleum product refiners. MV also develops
and designs proprietary technologies and systems used to condition biogas for use as renewable natural gas RNG ), for a
number of applications, such as transportation fuel and natural gas pipeline injection. 

SEER
Environmental Materials, LLC SEM ): (formed September 2015) is a wholly owned Colorado limited liability company registered
to do business in Texas. It was established as a materials technology development business with its sole operating facility in central
Texas. Initially, its primary purpose was developing advanced chemical absorbents and catalysts that enhance the capability of biogas
produced from landfills, wastewater treatment operations, and agricultural digester operations. SEM s central Texas media operations
were discontinued during the year ended December 31, 2023. SEM s current objective is to arrange the manufacturing and sale of
biochar production kilns and related equipment, as well as own and operate a biochar production facility in northeast Texas under a joint
venture license agreement from Biochar Now, LLC. 

19 

Majority
owned 

Paragon
Waste Solutions, LLC PWS ): (formed late 2010) PWS is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction
technology using a pyrolytic heating process combined with non-thermal plasma assisted oxidation. This technique involves
gasification of solid waste by heating the waste in a low-oxygen environment, followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in
the presence of plasma. This technology, commercially referred to as CoronaLux , is designed and intended for the clean 
destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste (i.e ., medical waste) thereby eliminating the need for costly segregation,
transportation, incineration or landfill (with their associated legacy liabilities). In 2023 SEER sold its North American patent rights
in a stock transaction and now holds a small, minority interest in Amlon Holdings. SEER continues to have the rights to develop the technology
internationally (outside of North America) and continues to promote and market the CoronaLux technology in international markets. 

PelleChar,
LLC PelleChar ): (formed September 2018) owned 51 by SEER. PelleChar has secured third-party pellet manufacturing
capabilities from one of the nation s premier pellet manufacturers. Working closely with Biochar Now, LLC, PelleChar commenced
sales in 2019 of its proprietary pellets containing the proven and superior Biochar Now product starting with the landscaping and big
agriculture markets. At this time, PelleChar is the only company able to offer a soil amendment pellet containing the Biochar Now product
that is produced using the patented pyrolytic process. PelleChar activity to date relates to promoting both domestic and international
sales. Revenue and expenses of PelleChar were not material for the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Joint
Ventures 

Eco
SEER Saudi : On December 17, 2022, SEER and Eco Tadweer ET ), a business entity incorporated in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia KSA entered into a joint venture with SEER owning a minority, non-controlling 49 interest in the joint venture.
The purpose of the joint venture is to market and monetize SEER s technologies in and around the KSA. While SEER is entitled to
appoint one of three managers, ET is responsible for funding, operation and management of the joint venture. Eco SEER has had minimal
operations as of September 30, 2024. 

SEER s
Financial Condition and Liquidity 

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has accumulated a deficit
of approximately 35.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and 33.7 million as of September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of approximately 1.5 million. The Company had a working capital
deficit of approximately 13.1 million as of September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company
to continue to operate as a going concern. 

Realization
of a major portion of the Company s assets as of September 30, 2024, is dependent upon continued operations. The Company is dependent
on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately 0.8 million from the issuance of short-term, for a net cash provided by financing
activities of approximately 0.6 million. In addition, the Company has undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as
a going concern. The Company continues to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross and net margins
through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions, including discontinuing the media production
of SEM, a specific line of business with historically insufficient margins. The Company has limited common shares available for issue
which may limit the ability to raise capital or settle debt through issuance of shares. The Company continues to own a small amount of
equity in Biochar Now, LLC (less than 1 which it intends to leverage or sell back. The Company has increased business development efforts
to address opportunities identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control
regulations. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it. There can be no assurance
that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income
and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would
be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Total
revenues were consistent at 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Operating
expenses, which include cost of products, general and administrative (G A) expenses, and salaries and related expenses, were consistent
at approximately 1.1 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Total
other income and expense was a net expense of approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately
 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of other income and expense is interest expense, which was consistent
at 0.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

There
is no provision for income taxes for both the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to our net losses for both periods
and we continue to maintain full allowances covering our net deferred tax benefits as of September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Loss
from continuing operations was approximately 0.5 million and 0.6 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The net loss attributable to SEER after deducting 800 for the non-controlling interest was approximately 0.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, which was consistent compared to a net loss of approximately 0.5 million, after adding 2,200 in non-controlling
interest and deducting 400 loss from discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Total
revenues were 2.6 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately
 0.4 million, or 18 in revenues comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is
attributable to our product percent-complete contract revenue increasing due to several material projects being postponed from prior
periods due to site preparation delays, coming online, and the delivery of ordered kilns to BioChar. 

Operating
expenses, which include cost of products, general and administrative (G A) expenses, and salaries and related expenses, were approximately
 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Product costs increased 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
due to above mentioned kiln deliveries in the second quarter of 2024, and increased activity in our percent-complete contracts. G A
expenses decreased 0.1 million, primarily due to reduced professional and accounting fees. 

Total
other income and expense was a net expense of approximately 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately
 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of other income and expense is interest expense, which was consistent
at 0.7 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we also had
approximately 0.2 million in other income, a result of selling equity units the Company owned in Biochar Now, LLC. 

There
is no provision for income taxes for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to our net losses for both periods
and we continue to maintain full allowances covering our net deferred tax benefits as of September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

21 

Loss
from continuing operations was approximately 1.5 million and 1.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The net loss attributable to SEER after deducting 3,200 for the non-controlling interest, and adding a gain from discontinued operations
of 3,700 was approximately 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of approximately 1.7
million, after adding 1,500 in non-controlling interest and adding 159,900 gain from discontinued operations, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Results
of Discontinued Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

As
of January 1, 2023, the Company abandoned its media production operations of its SEM subsidiary. All revenue and expenses of our SEM

Changes
in Cash Flow 

Operating
Activities 

The
Company had net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.7 million, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 of 0.9 million. Cash used by operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items
as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation and amortization of intangible
assets, and gain on the sale of fixed assets, bad debt, as well as fixed assets held for sale. Net loss of 1.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 decreased to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Non-cash adjustments increased
cash provided of 6,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used of 0.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

In
addition to the non-cash adjustments to net income, changes in assets and liabilities include: 

a) 
 changes
 in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and customer deposits provided 1.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared
 to providing 0.4 million in the first nine months of 2023, 
 
 b) 
 changes
 in deferred revenue provided 0.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to providing 14,600 in the first nine months
 of 2023, 
 
 c) 
 changes
 in accounts receivable used 0.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to providing 0.3 million in the first nine months
 of 2023, 

22 

d) 
 changes
 in prepaid expenses and other assets used 0.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to providing 0.1 million in the
 first nine months of 2023, 
 
 e) 
 changes
 in contract liabilities used 0.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to providing 14,600 in the first nine months
 of 2023, and 
 
 f) 
 changes
 in contract assets used 17,300 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to providing 0.1 million in the first nine months of
 2023. 

Investing
activities 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 36,800 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to providing 0.3 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company sold fixed assets held for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
collecting 0.1 million. The Company sold fixed assets held for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, collecting 0.3
million. Purchase of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 22,700. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with providing
 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s financing activities for both periods consist of new borrowing,
net of any principal payments made during the period. 

Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(U.S. GAAP) requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the forecasted cash flows
used in the impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets. The carrying amount of intangible assets; valuation allowances and
reserves for receivables; revenue recognition related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method; and the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts
Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable. We determine the allowance for
doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable, historical experience and management judgment. Accounts receivable balances
are reviewed individually for collectability, and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that the potential
for recovery is remote. An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately 24,200 has been reserved as of both September 30, 2024,
and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company is exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable. Our customers operate primarily
in the food, beverage, and agricultural space, as well as water treatment and landfill industries in the United States. Accordingly,
we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the United States. To limit
credit risk, management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we do not believe that we have significant credit risk. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates
their fair value due to their short-term maturities. We believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties, including
their current portion, approximate their fair value, as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial
condition and liquidity. We believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value, as their carried interest rates
are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties. 

23 

Long-lived
Assets 

The
Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future
cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference
between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount
and timing of estimated future cash flows. No impairments were determined as of September 30, 2024. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized under FASB guidelines, which requires an evaluation of revenue arrangements with customers following a five-step approach:
(1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price;
(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the company satisfies each
performance obligation. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised services are transferred to the customers in an amount that
reflects the expected consideration in exchange for those services. A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the
use of and obtain the benefits from the services. Other major provisions of the guidance include capitalization of certain contract costs,
consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before
contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure based on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, and under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and the person performing the similar function as Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

We
carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and Interim CFO, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) .
Based on that assessment and on those criteria, our CEO and Interim CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective as of September 30, 2024. The principal basis for this conclusion is (i) failure to engage sufficient resources regarding
our accounting and reporting obligations during our startup and (ii) failure to fully document our internal control policies and procedures. 

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. The management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary
rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management s report in this quarterly report. 

The
Company s management, including the Company s CEO and Interim CFO, does not expect that the Company s internal control
over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The
 500,000 secured short-term note issued on February 1, 2019, was past due as of September 30, 2024. We have accrued 100,000 shares of
Company stock per month, recorded as interest, as penalty shares per agreement with the lender, until paid, through December 31, 2020,
in accordance with a verbal agreement with the lender. No further share accrual is being made. A total of 1,850,000 penalty shares are
accrued, and due on demand, in accordance with this borrowing. Unpaid interest is approximately 30,000 as of the date of this report. 

The
 100,000 secured short-term note issued on July 2, 2019, was past due as of September 30, 2024. We are continuing to accrue interest
at the stated rate of 12 per annum, which is a total of approximately 60,000 as of the date of this report, until the loan is paid
in full, or an extension agreement is reached with the lender. We are in on-going discussions with our lenders regarding the terms and
conditions of the respective loans. Although we have not obtained a written waiver(s) or entered into an amendment(s) formally extending
or revising debt terms in all instances, the lenders, most of whom are also shareholders, have and are continuing to cooperate with the
company in order to resolve the matters in the best interest of all parties. 

The
