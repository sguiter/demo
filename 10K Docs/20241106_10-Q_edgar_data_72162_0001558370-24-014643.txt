 NL INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (unaudited) of our outstanding common stock and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran Corporation held approximately of Valhi s outstanding common stock. A majority of Contran s outstanding voting stock is held directly by Lisa K. Simmons and by family stockholders (Thomas C. Connelly (the husband of Ms. Simmons late sister), a family-owned entity and various family trusts established for the benefit of Ms. Simmons, Mr. Connelly and their children) who are required to vote their shares of Contran voting stock in the same manner as Ms. Simmons. Such voting rights are personal to Ms. Simmons and last through April 22, 2030. The remainder of Contran s outstanding voting stock is held by another trust (the Family Trust ), which was established for the benefit of Ms. Simmons and her late sister and their children and for which a third-party financial institution serves as trustee. Consequently, at September 30, 2024 Ms. Simmons and the Family Trust may be deemed to control Contran, and therefore may be deemed to indirectly control the wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran, Valhi and us. of Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (Kronos). CompX (NYSE American: CIX) and Kronos (NYSE: KRO) each file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report have been prepared on the same basis as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that we filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). In our opinion, we have made all necessary adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) in order to state fairly, in all material respects, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented. We have condensed the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 contained in this Quarterly Report as compared to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date, and we have omitted certain information and footnote disclosures (including those related to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023) normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our results of operations for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024 may not be indicative of our operating results for the full year. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2023 Annual Report. Cash dividends in 2024 include a per share special dividend.

Prior to the acquisition, LPC was operated as a joint venture between Kronos and Venator, and through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Kronos held a joint venture interest in LPC. Following the acquisition, and as a result of obtaining full control, LPC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kronos. Obtaining control of LPC and its estimated additional metric tons annually of TiO 2 production volume allows Kronos to better serve the North American TiO 2 marketplace. Kronos acquired the joint venture interest that it did not already own for consideration of million less a working capital adjustment of million. An additional earn-out payment of up to million based on Kronos aggregate consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA, during a period comprising calendar years 2025 and 2026 may be required. The aggregate EBITDA tiers for the earn-out period are million and million, with million of the earnout payable if Kronos achieves million in aggregate consolidated EBITDA, and a maximum of million payable if aggregate consolidated EBITDA is million or greater for the period. If Kronos achieves aggregate consolidated EBITDA between million and million, the payment of the additional million is pro-rated between the two targets. The earn-out is payable at the earliest in April 2027. The estimated fair value of the earn-out at the Acquisition Date is million and was determined using a weighted probability of potential outcomes based on estimated future EBITDA and volatility factors, among other variables and estimates. The acquisition was financed through borrowings of million under Kronos revolving credit facility and the remainder paid with cash on hand. Kronos recognized a non-cash gain of million million,

 cases over a period for which we were previously a party and for which we have been dismissed without any finding of liability. 
 Accordingly, we have not accrued any amounts for any of the pending lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation cases filed by or on behalf of states, counties, cities or their public housing authorities and school districts, or those asserted as class actions. In addition, we have determined that liability to us which may result, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because there is no prior history of a loss of this nature on which an estimate could be made and there is no substantive information available upon which an estimate could be based. In the terms of the County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Company, et al. (Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, Case No. 1-00-CV-788657) global settlement agreement, we have one installment payment of million remaining which is due in September 2025. Our remaining installment will be made with funds already on deposit at the court, which are included in current restricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, that are committed to the settlement, including all accrued interest at the date of payment, with amounts on deposit in excess of the final payment returned to us. See Note 16 to our 2023 Annual Report. New cases may continue to be filed against us. We do not know if we will incur liability in the future in respect to any of the pending or possible litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings. In the future, if new information regarding such matters becomes available to us (such as a final, non-appealable adverse verdict against us or otherwise ultimately being found liable with respect to such matters), at that time we would consider such information in evaluating any remaining cases then-pending against us as to whether it might then have become probable we have incurred liability with respect to these matters, and whether such liability, if any, could have become reasonably estimable. The resolution of any of these cases could result in the recognition of a loss contingency accrual that could have a material adverse impact on our net income for the interim or annual period during which such liability is recognized and a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and liquidity.

 Additions charged to expense, net Payments, net ) Balance at the end of the period Amounts recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the end of the period: Current liability Noncurrent liability Balance at the end of the period On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the potential range of our liability for environmental remediation and related costs at sites where we have been named as a PRP or defendant, including sites for which our wholly-owned environmental management subsidiary, NL Environmental Management Services, Inc. (EMS), has contractually assumed our obligations. At September 30, 2024, we had accrued approximately million related to approximately sites associated with remediation and related matters we believe are at the present time and/or in their current phase reasonably estimable. The upper end of the range of reasonably possible costs to us for remediation and related matters for which we believe it is possible to estimate costs is approximately million, including the amount currently accrued. These accruals have not been discounted to present value. We believe it is not reasonably possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites. At September 30, 2024, there were approximately sites for which we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of costs. For these sites, generally the investigation is in the early stages, and we are unable to determine whether or not we actually had any association with the site, the nature of our responsibility, if any, for the contamination at the site, if any, and the extent of contamination at and cost to remediate the site. The timing and availability of information on these sites is dependent on events outside of our control, such as when the party alleging liability provides information to us. At certain of these previously inactive sites, we have received general and special notices of liability from the EPA and/or state agencies alleging that we, sometimes with other PRPs, are liable for past and future costs of remediating environmental contamination allegedly caused by former operations. These notifications may assert that we, along with any other alleged PRPs, are liable for past and/or future clean-up costs. As further information becomes available to us for any of these sites, which would allow us to estimate a range of costs, we would at that time adjust our accruals. Any such adjustment could result in the recognition of an accrual that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations and liquidity. Insurance coverage claims We are involved in certain legal proceedings with a number of our former insurance carriers regarding the nature and extent of the carriers obligations to us under insurance policies with respect to certain lead pigment and asbestos lawsuits. The issue of whether insurance coverage for defense costs or indemnity or both will be found to exist for our lead pigment and asbestos litigation depends upon a variety of factors and we cannot assure you that such insurance coverage will be available. We have agreements with certain of our former insurance carriers pursuant to which the carriers reimburse us for a portion of our future lead pigment litigation defense costs, and one such carrier reimburses us for a portion of our future asbestos litigation defense costs. We are not able to determine how much we will ultimately recover from these carriers for defense costs incurred by us because of certain issues that arise regarding which defense costs qualify for reimbursement. While we continue to seek additional insurance recoveries, we do not know if we will be successful in obtaining reimbursement for either defense costs or indemnity. Accordingly, we recognize insurance recoveries in income only when receipt of the recovery is probable and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of the recovery.

 Technology related disruptions (including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks; software implementation, upgrades, or improvements; technology processing failures; or other events) related to our technology infrastructure that could impact our ability to continue operations, or at key vendors which could impact our supply chain, or at key customers which could impact their operations and cause them to curtail or pause orders;

 Results of operations Net income (loss) overview Quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 Our net income attributable to NL stockholders was 36.0 million, or .74 per share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss attributable to NL stockholders of .1 million, or nil per share, in the third quarter of 2023. As more fully described below, the increase in our net income attributable to NL stockholders from 2023 to 2024 is primarily due to the net effects of: 
 equity in earnings of Kronos of 21.9 million in 2024 compared to equity in losses of 6.2 million in 2023; 
 an unrealized gain in the relative value of marketable equity securities of 18.6 million in 2024 compared to .4 million in 2023; lower income from operations attributable to CompX of 3.3 million in 2024 compared to 6.6 million in 2023; and higher insurance recoveries of 1.1 million in 2024 compared to .3 million in 2023. Our 2024 net income per share attributable to NL stockholders includes: 
 income of .25 per share, net of tax, due to Kronos recognition of a non-cash gain resulting from the remeasurement of its investment in the TiO 2 manufacturing joint venture; and income of .02 per share, net of tax, related to insurance recoveries. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 Our net income attributable to NL stockholders was 50.7 million, or 1.04 per share, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a net loss attributable to NL stockholders of 9.9 million, or .20 per share, in the first nine months of 2023. As more fully described below, the increase in our earnings attributable to NL stockholders from 2023 to 2024 is primarily due to: 
 equity in earnings of Kronos of 30.4 million in 2024 compared to equity in losses of 13.4 million in 2023; an unrealized gain in the relative value of marketable equity securities of 21.8 million in 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 10.5 million in 2023; 
 lower income from operations attributable to CompX of 12.1 million in 2024 compared to 18.0 million in 2023; 
 a non-cash loss on the termination of our U.K. pension plan of 4.9 million in 2023; higher interest and dividend income of 7.9 million in 2024 compared to 6.5 million in 2023; and 
 higher insurance recoveries of 1.3 million in 2024 compared to .4 million in 2023. Our 2024 net income per share attributable to NL includes: 
 income of .25 per share, net of tax, due to Kronos recognition of a non-cash gain resulting from the remeasurement of its investment in the TiO 2 manufacturing joint venture; income of .02 per share, net of tax, related to insurance recoveries; and a loss of .01 per share due to Kronos recognition of an aggregate charge related to a write-off of deferred financing costs. Our 2023 net loss per share attributable to NL stockholders includes: 
 a loss of .08 per share, net of tax, due to the termination of our U.K. pension plan, and income of .01 per share, net of tax, due to Kronos recognition of a pre-tax insurance settlement gain related to a business interruption insurance claim arising from Hurricane Laura in 2020.

 Net sales Net sales decreased 6.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower Security Products sales to a government security customer and to a lesser extent lower Marine Components sales primarily to the towboat market. Net sales decreased 10.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower Marine Components sales to the towboat market. See discussion of reporting units below. Cost of sales and gross margin Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased 3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased over the same period. Gross margin percentage decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower gross margin percentages at both Security Products and Marine Components reporting units. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased 2 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined over the same period. The decline in gross margin percentage for the nine-month comparative period is primarily due to lower gross margin percentage at Marine Components. See discussion of reporting units below. Operating costs and expenses Operating costs expenses consist primarily of sales and administrative-related personnel costs, sales commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales and administrative costs relating to business unit and corporate management activities, as well as any gains and losses on property and equipment. Operating costs and expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were comparable to the same period in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, operating costs and expenses increased .6 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher employee salaries and benefits at Security Products during the first half of the year. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to decreased coverage of operating costs and expenses as a result of lower sales. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales increased for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to decreased coverage of operating costs and expenses as a result of lower sales and higher operating costs as noted above. Income from operations As a percentage of net sales, income from operations for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 was primarily impacted by the factors affecting sales, cost of sales, gross margin and operating costs and expenses. See discussion of reporting units below. Results by reporting unit The key performance indicators for CompX s reporting units is the level of their gross margin and income from operations (see discussion below). Reporting unit results exclude CompX corporate expenses.

Relative to prior year, sales were 5.0 million lower to the government security market and 1.4 million lower to the transportation market, partially offset by 1.2 million higher sales to the healthcare market. Security Products net sales in the first nine months of 2024 were comparable to the same period in 2023, as 1.5 million higher sales to the healthcare market and .6 million higher sales to the tool storage market were offset by 1.1 million lower sales to the transportation market, .7 million lower sales to distributors and .4 million lower sales to the government security market. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower sales, higher materials costs (primarily brass and electronics), higher labor costs and decreased coverage of fixed costs as a result of lower sales. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the factors impacting gross margin as well as decreased coverage of operating costs and expenses on lower sales.

 margin as a percentage of net sales for the first nine months of 2024 is comparable to the same period in 2023. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to increased operating costs and expenses including higher employee salaries and benefits of .4 million, primarily in the first half of the year.

Relative to prior year, the decrease in third quarter sales was primarily due to 1.3 million lower sales to the towboat market and .5 million lower sales to the industrial market. Marine Components net sales decreased 32 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Relative to prior year, the decrease in sales for the first nine months was primarily due to 8.7 million lower sales to the towboat market, 1.1 million lower sales to the industrial market and .6 million lower sales to each the engine builder market and distributors. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower sales and decreased coverage of fixed costs as a result of lower sales, partially offset by a more favorable customer and product mix as well as lower employee salaries and benefits of approximately .5 million related to headcount reductions. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the factors impacting gross margin as well as decreased coverage of operating costs and expenses on lower sales, partially offset by slightly reduced operating costs and expenses, including lower employee salaries and benefits of approximately .1 million. For the first nine months of 2024, gross margin as a percentage of net sales declined compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher cost inventory produced during the fourth quarter of 2023 and sold in the first quarter of 2024 and decreased coverage of fixed costs as a result of lower sales, partially offset by a more favorable customer and product mix as well as lower employee salaries and benefits of approximately 1.7 million related to headcount reductions. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the factors impacting gross margin as well as decreased coverage of operating costs and expenses on lower sales, partially offset by reduced operating costs and expenses, including lower employee salaries and benefits of .2 million. Outlook As previously noted, beginning in the third quarter of 2023 CompX s Security Products reporting unit had significant sales from a pilot project to a government security customer. Excluding these sales in 2023, Security Products sales would have increased in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to increased sales across a variety of markets, particularly increased sales of mechanical locks to the government security market. At CompX s Marine Components reporting unit, the decline in sales to the towboat market as a result of the contraction in the recreational marine industry that began late in the first quarter of 2023 has continued. CompX is focused on aligning its resources with current demand levels, and particularly at Marine Components, CompX is adjusting inventory levels, operating expenses and labor resources to align with current orders while also preserving its ability to respond quickly when demand increases. Raw material prices have been relatively stable during the first nine months of 2024; however, CompX is beginning to experience price increases in certain raw materials. CompX s supply chains are stable and transportation and logistical delays are minimal. CompX has adjusted its order patterns in response to its customer demand levels and the stability of its raw materials supplies. CompX expects Security Products sales comparisons for the remainder of the year will be challenged by lower government security sales as the 2023 pilot project to a government security customer will not repeat. CompX expects its recurring Security Products sales for the remainder of the year to continue to be strong relative to the prior year. Overall, CompX expects Security Products gross margin and operating income margin for 2024 will be lower than 2023 primarily due to reduced coverage of fixed, selling, general and administrative costs as a result of lower expected sales as well as a less favorable product mix and higher materials and labor costs in the current economic environment. CompX expects Marine Components net sales for the full year of 2024 will be lower as compared

 to 2023 due to decreased demand in the towboat market. The recreational marine industry faces strong headwinds due to higher interest rates and broader market weakness. Overall, CompX expects Marine Components gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2024 to be lower than 2023 due to lower coverage of fixed overhead as a result of lower expected sales, and operating income as a percentage of net sales to be similarly lower as a result of reduced coverage of selling, general and administrative expenses due to lower expected sales. CompX ended 2023 with elevated inventory balances at its Marine Components segment as a result of increased orders of certain raw materials due to previously long lead times coupled with the rapidly changing towboat demand which created a misalignment of its raw materials with near term demand. CompX made significant progress in aligning its Marine Components inventory balances with current demand in the first nine months of 2024; however, we expect further reduction of inventory quantities will be offset by higher raw materials costs for certain projects in the industrial and other marine components markets, outside of the towboat market, which in many instances are more expensive than the stainless steel inventory used in towboat products. CompX s expectations for its operations and the markets it serves are based on a number of factors outside its control. CompX has experienced global and domestic supply chain challenges, and any future impacts on its operations will depend on, among other things, any future disruption in its operations or its suppliers operations, the impact of economic conditions and geopolitical events on demand for its products or its customers and suppliers operations, all of which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted . General corporate and other items Corporate expense Corporate expenses were 2.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, .9 million lower than in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to lower litigation fees and related costs and lower environmental remediation and related costs. Included in corporate expense in the third quarter of 2023 and 2024 are: 
 litigation fees and related costs of .6 million in 2024 compared to 1.2 million in 2023, and environmental remediation and related costs of .1 million in 2024 compared to .3 million in 2023. Corporate expenses were 9.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, .1 million higher than in the first nine months of 2023 as lower litigation fees and related costs were offset by higher environmental remediation and related costs. Included in corporate expense in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024 are: 
 litigation fees and related costs of 2.6 million in 2024 compared to 3.7 million in 2023, and environmental remediation and related costs of 1.4 million in 2024 compared to .4 million in 2023. The level of our litigation fees and related costs varies from period to period depending upon, among other things, the number of cases in which we are currently involved, the nature of such cases and the current stage of such cases (e.g. discovery, pre-trial motions, trial or appeal, if applicable). See Note 13 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. If our current expectations regarding the number of cases in which we expect to be involved during 2024 or the nature of such cases were to change, our corporate expenses could be higher than we currently estimate. Obligations for environmental remediation costs are difficult to assess and estimate and it is possible that actual costs for environmental remediation will exceed accrued amounts or that costs will be incurred in the future for sites in which we cannot currently estimate our liability. If these events were to occur in 2024, our corporate expenses would be higher than we currently estimate. In addition, we adjust our environmental accruals as further information becomes available to us or as circumstances change. Such further information or changed circumstances could result in an increase in our accrued environmental costs. See Note 13 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Overall, we currently expect that our net general corporate expenses in 2024 will be higher than in 2023 primarily due to higher expected environmental remediation and related costs. Interest and dividend income Interest and dividend income increased in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily due to higher average interest rates and increased investment balances, somewhat offset by lower average balances on CompX s revolving promissory notes receivable from Valhi. See Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Marketable equity securities We recognized an unrealized gain of 18.6 million on the change in value of our marketable equity securities in the third quarter of 2024 compared to .4 million in the third quarter of 2023. We recognized an unrealized gain of 21.8 million on the change in value of our marketable equity securities in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 10.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. See Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Income tax expense We recognized income tax expense of 8.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of .9 million in the third quarter of 2023 and income tax expense of 10.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 6.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize deferred income taxes on our undistributed equity in earnings of Kronos. Because we and Kronos are part of the same U.S. federal income tax group, any dividends we receive from Kronos are nontaxable to us. Accordingly, we do not recognize and we are not required to pay income taxes on dividends from Kronos. Therefore, our full-year effective income tax rate will generally be lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate in years during which we receive dividends from Kronos and recognize equity in earnings of Kronos. Conversely, our effective income tax rate will generally be higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate in years during which we receive dividends from Kronos and recognize equity in losses of Kronos. During interim periods, our effective income tax rate may not necessarily correspond to the foregoing due to the application of accounting for income taxes in interim periods which requires us to base our effective rate on full year projections. We received dividends from Kronos of 20.1 million and 15.1 million in the first nine month periods of 2023 and 2024, respectively. Our effective tax rate attributable to our equity in earnings of Kronos, including the effect of the nontaxable dividends we received from Kronos, was an effective tax rate of 12.7 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an effective rate of 50 in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in our effective rate from 2023 to 2024 is primarily attributable to Kronos anticipated higher full year earnings offset by the effect of lower anticipated full year dividends in 2024 as compared to 2023. See Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our 2024 income tax items, including a tabular reconciliation of our statutory tax expense to our actual expense. Noncontrolling interest Noncontrolling interest in net income of CompX decreased during the third quarter of 2024 and for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same prior year periods. The noncontrolling interest we recognize in each period is directly related to the level of earnings at CompX for the period.

 Thousands of metric tons As previously reported, effective July 16, 2024, Kronos acquired the 50 joint venture interest in Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. LPC previously held by Venator Investments, Ltd. Venator ). Prior to the acquisition, LPC was operated as a manufacturing joint venture between Kronos and Venator, and through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Kronos held a 50 joint venture interest in LPC. Following the acquisition, LPC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kronos. Kronos acquired the 50 joint venture interest that it did not already own for consideration of 185 million less a working capital adjustment of 11.0 million. An additional earn-out payment of up to 15 million based on Kronos aggregate consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA, during a two-year period comprising calendar years 2025 and 2026 may be required. The acquisition was financed through borrowings of 132.1 million under Kronos revolving credit facility and the remainder paid with cash on hand. Kronos accounted for the acquisition of LPC s interest as a business combination. See Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Kronos key performance indicators are its TiO 2 average selling prices, its level of TiO 2 sales and production volumes and the cost of titanium-containing feedstock purchased from third parties. TiO 2 selling prices generally follow industry trends and prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures.

 Current industry conditions Kronos and the TiO 2 industry experienced an extended period of significantly reduced demand across all major markets which was reflected in its sales volumes throughout 2023. While demand has improved in 2024 resulting in increased sales volumes across all major markets compared to the prior year, overall demand remains below average historical levels and during the third quarter of 2024, demand moderated as compared to the first half of the year. Kronos started 2024 with average TiO 2 selling prices 13 lower than at the beginning of 2023 and its average TiO 2 selling prices increased 4 during the first nine months of 2024. Kronos average TiO 2 selling prices in the first nine months of 2024 were 7 lower than average prices during the first nine months of 2023. Kronos operated its production facilities at 71 of practical capacity utilization in the first nine months of 2023 in response to decreased demand and higher production costs. As a result of increased demand experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first nine months of 2024, along with more favorable production costs, Kronos began increasing its production rates during the first quarter of 2024 and it operated at near practical capacity in the second and third quarters of 2024 resulting in 93 of practical capacity utilization in the first nine months of 2024. The following table shows Kronos capacity utilization rates during 2023 and 2024. 

Production Capacity Utilization Rates 2023 2024 First Quarter 76 87 Second Quarter 64 99 Third Quarter 73 92 Excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, Kronos cost of sales per metric ton of TiO 2 sold in the first nine months of 2024 was significantly lower as compared to the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to significant decreases in per metric ton production costs (primarily feedstock and energy). In response to the extended period of reduced demand in 2023, discussed above, Kronos took measures to reduce its operating costs and improve its long-term cost structure such as the implementation of certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions during the third quarter of 2023 that primarily impacted its European operations. A substantial portion of Kronos workforce reductions were accomplished through voluntary programs, for which eligible workforce reduction costs are recognized at the time bo t h t h e e m p lo y e e a n d e m p lo y e r a r e i rr e vo ca b l y c o m mitte d t o t h e te r ms o f the sep a rati o n.

Kronos recognized a total of approximately 6 m illi on i n c h ar g es pr im a r il y i n t h e f o ur t h qu a rter o f 2023 r elated to work f orc e re d uctio n s it implement e d during the sec ond h a l f o f t h e y e a r. Kronos has paid approximately 4 million through the end of the third quarter. The majority of the remaining related cash payments will be paid by the end of 2024 . In the third quarter of 2024, Kronos closed its sulfate process line at its plant in Varennes, Canada. As a result of the sulfate process line closure, Kronos recognized charges to cost of sales in the first nine months of 2024 of approximately 2 million related to workforce reductions for employees impacted of which approximately .6 million was paid through the end of the third quarter. Kronos also recognized a total of approximately 14 million in non-cash charges primarily related to accelerated depreciation in the second and third quarters of 2024. 

Net sales Kronos net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 22 , or 87.8 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the effects of a 21 increase in sales volumes (which increased net sales by approximately 83 million) partially offset by a 1 decrease in average TiO 2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately 4 million). The effects of changes in currency exchange rates in the third quarter of 2024 were comparable to the third quarter of 2023. TiO 2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs. Kronos sales volumes increased 21 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to higher overall demand across all major markets. Incremental sales volumes generated from the LPC acquisition did not materially impact quarter to quarter comparisons. Kronos net sales in the first nine months of 2024 increased 16 , or 197.6 million, compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the effects of a 26 increase in sales volumes due to improved overall demand across all major markets (which increased net sales by approximately 329 million) partially offset by a 7 decrease in average TiO 2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately 89 million). Changes in product mix negatively contributed to net sales, primarily due to changes in product sales mix in export markets in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, Kronos estimates that changes in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) increased its net sales by approximately 5 million in the first nine months of 2024 as

 compared to the first nine months of 2023. TiO 2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures and changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs. Incremental sales volumes resulting from the LPC acquisition did not materially impact period to period comparisons in the respective nine-month periods. Cost of sales and gross margin Kronos cost of sales increased by 21.0 million, or 6 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to the net effects of a 21 increase in sales volumes, higher production rates and lower production costs of approximately 24 million (primarily energy and raw materials). Kronos cost of sales in the third quarter of 2024 also includes approximately 4 million in non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation in connection with the closure of its sulfate process line in Canada. Kronos cost of sales in the third quarter of 2023 includes 20 million of unabsorbed fixed production and other manufacturing costs associated with production curtailments at its facilities during the third quarter of 2023 as it adjusted its TiO 2 production volumes to align inventory levels with lower demand. Kronos third quarter production volumes include approximately 13,000 metric tons of incremental production resulting from the LPC acquisition. Kronos cost of sales as a percentage of net sales improved to 79 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 91 in the same period of 2023 primarily due to the favorable effects of lower production costs and higher production volumes resulting in increased coverage of fixed production costs. Kronos gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 21 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 9 in the third quarter of 2023. As discussed and quantified above, Kronos gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to higher sales and production volumes and lower production costs, which were partially offset by lower average TiO 2 selling prices. Kronos cost of sales increased 34.0 million, or 3 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to the net effects of a 26 increase in sales volumes, higher production rates resulting in reduced unabsorbed fixed production costs, and lower production costs of approximately 108 million (primarily raw materials and energy). Kronos unabsorbed fixed production costs in the first nine months of 2024 were 12 million (incurred in the first quarter) compared to 74 million in the first nine months of 2023 related to curtailments in 2023 and continuing into the first quarter of 2024, as discussed above. Kronos cost of sales in the first nine months of 2024 includes a charge of approximately 2 million related to workforce reductions and approximately 14 million in non-cash charges primarily related to accelerated depreciation in connection with the closure of its sulfate process line in Canada. Sales and production volumes resulting from the LPC acquisition did not materially impact comparisons to the prior year. Kronos cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 81 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 91 in the same period of 2023 primarily due to the favorable effects of lower production costs and higher production volumes resulting in increased coverage of fixed production costs. Kronos gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 19 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 9 in the first nine months of 2023. As discussed and quantified above, Kronos gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to higher sales and production volumes as well as lower production costs, partially offset by lower average TiO 2 selling prices. Selling, general and administrative expense Kronos selling, administrative expense increased 8.7 million, or 16 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher distribution costs related to higher sales volumes during the quarter. Kronos selling, general, and administrative expense in the third quarter of 2024 also includes 2.2 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the LPC acquisition. Kronos selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 13 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Kronos s elling, general and administrative expense increased 17.5 million, or 11 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher distribution costs related to higher sales volumes. Kronos selling, general and administrative expense in the first nine months of 2024 also includes 2.2 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the LPC acquisition . Kronos selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales remained consistent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 . Income (loss) from operations Kronos had income from operations of 38.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a loss from operations of 25.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the factors impacting gross margin discussed above. Kronos estimates that changes in currency exchange rates increased its income from operations by approximately 13 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as discussed in the effects of currency exchange rates section below. Kronos had income from operations of 94.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a loss from operations of 50.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 as a result of the factors impacting gross margin discussed above. Kronos recognized a

Table of Contents 
 gain of 2.5 million in the first nine months of 2023 related to cash received from the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim. Kronos estimates that changes in currency exchange rates increased its income from operations by approximately 10 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as further discussed below. Other non-operating income (expense) Kronos recognized a gain on the remeasurement of its investment in LPC of 64.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the acquisition. Kronos interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 increased 7.5 million compared to interest expense in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the February 2024 exchange of 325 million of its 3.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 for newly issued 276.174 million of 9.50 Senior Secured Notes due March 2029 plus additional cash consideration, the July 30, 2024 issuance of an additional 75 million of 9.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2029, and as a result of the 53.7 million subordinated, unsecured term loan from Contran due September 2029 at an interest rate of 11.5 which Kronos entered into in February 2024 in connection with the exchange and which interest rate was amended to 9.54 in August 2024 in conjunction with the issuance of the additional 75 million of 9.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2029. Kronos recognized an unrealized gain of 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 related to the change in market price of its marketable equity securities . There was no change in the relative market value of Kronos marketable equity securities in the third quarter of 2023. Kronos other components of net periodic pension and OPEB cost in the third quarter of 2024 decreased .6 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets. Kronos interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 increased 18.0 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to higher interest rates on the debt exchange and the issuance of new notes noted above. As a result of the exchange, interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 includes a charge of 1.5 million for the write-off of deferred financing costs. Kronos recognized a gain of 2.6 million on the change in value of its marketable equity securities in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a loss of 1.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. Kronos other components of net periodic pension and OPEB cost in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 3.1 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets and a non-recurring 1.3 million in settlement costs related to the termination and buy-out of its U.K. pension plan in the second quarter of 2023. Income tax expense (benefit) Kronos recognized income tax expense of 22.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 8.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The difference is primarily due to higher earnings in the third quarter of 2024 and the jurisdictional mix of such earnings. Kronos earnings and losses are subject to income tax in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to the pre-tax earnings (losses) of its non-U.S. operations are generally higher than the income tax rates applicable to its U.S. operations. Kronos would generally expect its overall effective tax rate, excluding the effect of any increase or decrease in its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance or changes in its reserve for uncertain tax positions, to be higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily because of its sizeable non-U.S. operations. Kronos recognized income tax expense of 34.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 19.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The difference is primarily due to higher earnings in 2024 and the jurisdictional mix of such earnings. Kronos earnings are subject to income tax in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to the pre-tax earnings (losses) of its non-U.S. operations are generally higher than the income tax rates applicable to its U.S. operations. Kronos would generally expect its overall effective tax rate, excluding the effect of any increase or decrease in its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance or changes in its reserve for uncertain tax positions, to be higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily because of its sizeable non-U.S. operations. However, in the first nine months of 2024, Kronos consolidated effective income tax rate, excluding the effect of the valuation allowance and change in reserve for uncertain tax positions, is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to the effect of lower earnings and tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain high tax jurisdictions. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD ), the European Union and other countries have committed to enacting the OECD s Pillar Two initiative that would provide a global minimum level of taxation for multinational companies to be applied on a country-by-country basis. Currently, many countries are drafting or have enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two rules effective for years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Based on legislation currently enacted, Kronos does not anticipate any material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements; however, until all the jurisdictions it operates in enact legislation, the full impact of Pillar Two to Kronos is unknown. Effects of currency exchange rates Kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the United States (primarily in Germany, Belgium, Norway and Canada). The majority of Kronos sales from non-U.S. operations are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, other major European currencies and the Canadian dollar. A portion of Kronos sales generated from its non-U.S. operations is denominated in the U.S. dollar (and consequently Kronos non-U.S. operations will generally hold U.S. dollars from time to time). Certain raw materials used in all Kronos production facilities, primarily titanium-containing feedstocks, are purchased primarily in U.S.

 dollars, while labor and other production and administrative costs are incurred primarily in local currencies. Consequently, the translated U.S. dollar value of Kronos non-U.S. sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period-to-period operating results. In addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time, Kronos non-U.S. operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to (i) the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non-local currency sales or operating costs (primarily U.S. dollar denominated) are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non-local currency, and (ii) changes in currency exchange rates during time periods when Kronos non-U.S. operations are holding non-local currency (primarily U.S. dollars). Overall, Kronos estimates that fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on its sales and income (loss) from operations for the periods indicated.

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone in 2024 did not have a significant effect on Kronos net sales, as a substantial portion of the sales generated by its Canadian and Norwegian operations is denominated in the U.S. dollar. The 13 million increase in income from operations was comprised of the following: 
 Lower net currency transaction losses of approximately 7 million primarily caused by relative changes in currency exchange rates at each applicable balance sheet date between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone, and between the euro and the Norwegian krone, which causes increases or decreases, as applicable, in U.S. dollar-denominated receivables and payables and U.S. dollar currency held by Kronos non-U.S. operations, and in Norwegian krone denominated receivables and payables held by its non-U.S. operations, and Approximately 6 million from net currency translation gains primarily caused by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone, as local currency-denominated operating costs were translated into fewer U.S. dollars in 2024 as compared to 2023. The effect of the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro was nominal in 2024 as compared to 2023.

 The 10 million increase in income from operations was comprised of the following: 
 Higher net currency transaction gains of approximately 1 million primarily caused by relative changes in currency exchange rates at each applicable balance sheet date between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone, and between the euro and the Norwegian krone, which causes increases or decreases, as applicable, in U.S. dollar-denominated receivables and payables and U.S. dollar currency held by Kronos non-U.S. operations, and in Norwegian krone denominated receivables and payables held by its non-U.S. operations, and Approximately 9 million from net currency translation gains primarily caused by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone, as local currency-denominated operating costs were translated into fewer U.S. dollars in 2024 as compared to 2023. The effect of the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro was nominal in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Outlook Overall Kronos customer demand has improved in 2024 compared to the historical low demand it experienced during 2023, although overall demand levels remain below historical averages and, during the third quarter of 2024, customer demand moderated as compared to the first half of the year across all major markets. Kronos expects demand to further soften in the fourth quarter; however, based on the improved demand experienced through the first nine months, along with the severe demand contraction it experienced during most of 2023, Kronos continues to expect sales volumes in 2024 will exceed 2023 sales volumes. Kronos is operating its facilities at production rates in line with the current and expected near-term demand and believes its production rates for the remainder of 2024 will continue to be higher than comparable periods in 2023. Kronos has had limited success implementing TiO 2 selling price increases, which need to continue to be realized to achieve margins more in-line with historical levels. Throughout 2023, Kronos implemented cost reduction initiatives designed to improve its long-term cost structure, including targeted workforce reductions. In the third quarter of 2024, to further improve gross margins through the optimization of production of its purified grades, Kronos closed its sulfate process line at its facility in Canada. Raw material, energy and other input costs have generally improved compared to 2023. While the full positive impact of input cost improvements and cost reduction efforts are not yet fully reflected in Kronos gross margin, during the second quarter gross margin began to improve and has continued to improve as it replaces higher cost inventory with lower cost inventory produced in 2024. Overall, due to improved demand, modest increases in selling prices and lower production costs, including lower unabsorbed fixed costs, Kronos expects to report higher operating results for the full year of 2024 as compared to 2023. As noted above, Kronos acquired control of LPC in July 2024. Kronos believes this acquisition is a unique opportunity to immediately add value to its customers and better serve the North American marketplace by allowing it to expand its product offerings and increase sales to new and existing customers while recognizing significant synergies, including commercial, overhead and supply chain optimization. Kronos is in the process of fully integrating the additional LPC production capacity and it expects the acquisition will have a positive impact on its earnings, although the potential positive impact in 2024 will be limited by competitive pressures, demand moderation in North America and by the additional debt service costs associated with the increase in borrowings to complete the transaction. With the increased borrowing availability under Kronos revolving credit facility, as well as cash on hand, Kronos is well positioned to finance the required working capital build needed to fully integrate the acquired LPC production capacity, which it expects to be complete by the end of the year. Beginning in the third quarter, Kronos reduced its quarterly dividend rate from .19 per share to .05 per share to provide the flexibility to absorb increased debt service costs, working capital needs and capital improvements from the LPC acquisition. Kronos expectations for the TiO 2 industry and its operations are based on a number of factors outside its control. Kronos has experienced global market disruptions, including high energy costs, and future impacts on its operations will depend on, among other things, future energy costs and the impact economic conditions and geopolitical events have on its operations or its customers and suppliers operations, all of which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated cash flows Operating activities Trends in cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of deferred taxes and relative changes in assets and liabilities, are generally similar to trends in our income from operations.

Table of Contents 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 16.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 15.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 includes: higher net cash provided for relative changes in receivables, inventories, prepaids, payables and accrued liabilities in 2024 of 8.8 million; higher interest income received in 2024 of 3.1 million due to higher interest rates and increased investment balances, partially offset by lower average balances on loan to affiliate; higher insurance recoveries received of .9 million; lower dividends received from Kronos in 2024 of 5.0 million; lower income from operations from CompX in 2024 of 5.9 million; and higher cash paid for taxes in 2024 of .5 million due to the relative timing of tax payments . 
 We do not have complete access to CompX s cash flows in part because we do not own 100 of CompX. A detail of our consolidated cash flows from operating activities is presented in the table below. Intercompany dividends have been eliminated. The reference to NL Parent in the table below is a reference to NL Industries, Inc., as the parent company of CompX and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

As shown below, average days sales outstanding increased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of relative changes in the timing of sales and collections relative to the end of the quarter. Total average number of days in inventory increased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily because days in inventory at December 31, 2023 is lower than usual due to the fulfillment and shipping of a significant order during the fourth quarter of 2023. Total average number of days in inventory decreased from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to planned inventory reductions. For comparative purposes, we have provided December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 numbers below.

During the first nine months of 2024, Valhi repaid a net 2.7 million under the promissory note 17.7 million of gross borrowings and 20.4 million of gross repayments). During the first nine months of 2023, Valhi repaid a net 1.2 million under the promissory note 20.7 million of gross borrowings and 21.9 million of gross repayments). During the first nine months of 2024, we received gross proceeds from U.S. treasury bill maturities totaling 54.0 million. During the first nine months of 2023, we had gross purchases of U.S. treasury marketable securities aggregating 61.4 million and received gross proceeds totaling 54.0 million related to U.S. treasury bill maturities.

 Financing activities Our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of .08 per share in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024, and our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of .07 per share in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we paid aggregate quarterly dividends to NL shareholders of 11.7 million and 10.3 million, respectively. Additionally, in August 2024 our board of directors declared a special dividend of .43 per share on our common stock 21.0 million). The declaration and payment of future dividends, and the amount thereof, is discretionary and is dependent upon our financial condition, cash requirements, contractual obligations and restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. The amount and timing of past dividends is not necessarily indicative of the amount or timing of any future dividends which might be paid. There are currently no contractual restrictions on the amount of dividends which we may pay. Cash flows from financing activities in the first nine months of each of 2023 and 2024 also include CompX dividends paid to its stockholders other than us. Outstanding debt obligations At September 30, 2024, NLKW had outstanding debt obligations of .5 million under its secured revolving credit facility with Valhi, and CompX did not have any outstanding debt obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our secured revolving credit facility with Valhi at September 30, 2024. See Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. At September 30, 2024, Kronos had 25 million outstanding on its 300 million global revolving credit facility (the Global Revolver ). Availability under the Global Revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation, as defined in the agreement, and at September 30, 2024, approximately 268 million was available for borrowings. Effective July 17, 2024, Kronos completed an amendment to its Global Revolver (the Second Amendment ). Among other things, the Second Amendment increased the maximum borrowing amount from 225 million to 300 million, extended the maturity date to July 2029 and expanded the facility to include LPC and LPC s receivables and certain of its inventories in the borrowing base. The LPC acquisition was financed through borrowings of 132.1 million under Kronos Global Revolver with the remainder paid with cash on hand. In February 2024, Kronos exchanged 325 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.75 Senior Secured Notes due in September 2025 (the Old Notes for newly issued 276.174 million aggregate outstanding 9.50 Senior Secured Notes due March 2029 (the New Notes and together with the Old Notes, the Senior Secured Notes plus additional cash consideration of 48.75 million 52.6 million). In connection with the exchange, Kronos entered into a 53.7 million unsecured term loan from Contran Corporation due in September 2029 (the Contran Term Loan ). On July 30, 2024, Kronos wholly-owned subsidiary, KII, issued an additional 75 million principal amount of 9.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the Additional New Notes ). The Additional New Notes were issued at a premium of 107.50 of their principal amount, plus accrued interest from February 12, 2024, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 90 million, after fees and estimated expenses. The Additional New Notes will be fungible with the New Notes, will be treated as a single series with the New Notes, and will have the same terms as the New Notes, other than their date of issuance and issue price. The proceeds from the Additional New Notes were used to pay down borrowings under Kronos Global Revolver. Subsequent to the issuance of the Additional Notes, in August 2024, the Contran Term Loan was amended to change the interest rate from 11.5 to 9.54 . The amended rate reflects the effective interest rate of the Additional New Notes plus an additional interest rate spread of 2 which is based upon comparable debt transactions at the time of issuance of the Additional New Notes. The Contran Term loan is subordinated in right of payment to Kronos Senior Secured Notes and its Global Revolver. Kronos Senior Secured Notes, the Contran Term Loan and Kronos Global Revolver contain a number of covenants and restrictions which, among other things, restrict its ability to incur or guarantee additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer substantially all of its assets to, another entity, and contain other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of these types. Kronos credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with typical financial or payment covenants. For example, the credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control (as defined in the agreement) of the borrower. In addition, the credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business. Kronos is in compliance with all of its debt covenants at September 30, 2024. Kronos believes it will be able to continue to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility through its maturity.

 Future cash requirements Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our cash flow from operating activities and credit facilities with affiliates as further discussed below. We generally use these amounts to fund capital expenditures (substantially all of which relate to CompX), pay ongoing environmental remediation and litigation costs and provide for the payment of dividends (if declared). At September 30, 2024, we had aggregate restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 176.2 million, all of which was held in the U.S. A detail by entity is presented in the table below. 

Amount (In millions) CompX 58.8 NL Parent and wholly-owned subsidiaries 117.4 Total 176.2 In addition, at September 30, 2024 we owned approximately 1.2 million shares of Valhi common stock with an aggregate market value of 40.0 million. See Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We also owned approximately 35.2 million shares of Kronos common stock at September 30, 2024 with an aggregate market value of 438.5 million. See Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We routinely compare our liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows we expect to receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result of this process, we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital, incur debt, repurchase indebtedness in the market or otherwise, modify our dividend policies, consider the sale of our interests in our subsidiaries, affiliates, business, marketable securities or other assets, or take a combination of these and other steps, to increase liquidity, reduce indebtedness and fund future activities. Such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of interests in or combinations with companies (including related companies) perceived by management to be undervalued in the marketplace. These companies may or may not be engaged in businesses related to our current businesses. We intend to consider such acquisition activities in the future and, in connection with this activity, may consider issuing additional equity securities and increasing indebtedness. From time to time, we also evaluate the restructuring of ownership interests among our respective subsidiaries and related companies. Based upon our expectations of our operating performance, and the anticipated demands on our cash resources we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term obligations (defined as the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025) and long-term obligations (defined as the five-year period ending September 30, 2029) including any amounts CompX might loan from time to time under the terms of its revolving loan to Valhi (which loans would be solely at CompX s discretion). If actual developments differ materially from our expectations, our liquidity could be adversely affected. In this regard, Valhi has agreed to loan us up to 50 million on a revolving basis. At September 30, 2024, we had .5 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility, and we had 49.5 million available for future borrowing. See Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures Firm purchase commitments for capital projects in process at September 30, 2024 totaled .6 million. CompX expects to spend 2.1 million during 2024 on capital investments, primarily those expenditures required to meet CompX s existing customer demand and to properly maintain its facilities and technology infrastructure. Repurchases of common stock At September 30, 2024, CompX has 523,647 shares available for repurchase under a stock repurchase program authorized by its board of directors. Dividends Because our operations are conducted primarily through subsidiaries and affiliates, our long-term ability to meet parent company-level corporate obligations is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and

 affiliates. A detail of annual dividends we expect to receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates in 2024, based on the number of shares of common stock of these affiliates we own as of September 30, 2024 and their current regular quarterly dividend rate, is presented in the table below. In July of 2024, Kronos announced a decrease in its regular quarterly dividend from .19 per share to .05 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2024. The amount shown in the table below for Kronos reflects aggregate dividends we expect to receive from Kronos during 2024 (including actual receipts in the first, second and third quarters). Additionally, CompX s board of directors declared a special dividend on its Class A common stock of 2.00 per share that was paid on August 28, 2024. We received 21.5 million from this dividend which is not included in the table below because it is not expected to be recurring.

We base our purchase decisions on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the optimal use of our capital, taking into account the market value of the securities and the relative value of expected returns on alternative investments. In connection with these activities, we may consider issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness. We may also evaluate the restructuring of ownership interests of our businesses among our subsidiaries and related companies. Commitments and contingencies There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since we filed our 2023 Annual Report and we refer you to that report for a complete description of these commitments. We are subject to certain commitments and contingencies, as more fully described or referenced in our 2023 Annual Report, or in Note 13 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or in Part II, Item 1 of this report, including certain legal proceedings. In addition to such legal proceedings, various legislation and administrative regulations have, from time to time, been proposed that seek to (i) impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead-based paint (including us) with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and (ii) effectively overturn court decisions in which we and other pigment manufacturers have been successful. Examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share, rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations. While no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date that are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity, enactment of such legislation could have such an effect. Recent accounting pronouncements See Note 15 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Part I, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2024. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk, including currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity security prices. There have been no material changes in these market risks since we filed our 2023 Annual Report, and we refer you to Part I, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report. See also Note 14 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures which, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit to the SEC under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions to be made regarding required disclosure. Each of Courtney J. Riley, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Amy Allbach Samford, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, these executive officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this evaluation. Internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting which, as defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) means a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets, Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of an unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Other As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting excludes (i) internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees and (ii) internal control over the preparation of any financial statement schedules which would be required by Article 12 of Regulation S-X. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In addition to the matter discussed below, refer to Note 13 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, our Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 4, 2024 and filed on September 5, 2024, our June 30, 2024 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report for descriptions of certain legal proceedings. Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. In October 2024, we were served in Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. Consolidated Edison Co . of New York, et al. (United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Case No. 1:24-cv-06993). This complaint asserts claims under CERCLA and New York law against NL and a number of other private parties, federal and state agencies, and agencies of the City of New York. The plaintiff, a former gas manufacturer, seeks to recover a portion of investigation and remediation costs it allegedly incurred to address contamination at the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. NL intends to deny liability and will vigorously defend against all claims .
