of the voting interest
of Ta-nooma. 

Product
Development 

The
company flagship product is AppySleep A Biofeedback snoring treatment wristband, combined with the AppySleep App AppySleep ). 

The
AppySleep product is currently in serial manufacturing and commercial stage. The AppySleep IOS and Android versions were launched during
the third quarter of 2024. During the first 6 months of 2024 the company didn t invest substantial capital in marketing AppySleep
in order to invest it once the IOS version will be available for download, since the Company saw significant demand in the US market
for the AppySleep IOS version. 

Financial
position 

The
financial statements are presented on a going-concern basis. To date, the Company has not generated any significant revenues, experienced
recurring losses from operations, incurred negative cash flows from operating activities, and is dependent upon external sources for
financing its operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and a stockholders deficiency
of . These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends
to continue to finance its operating activities by raising capital. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in obtaining
an adequate level of financing needed for its long-term research and development activities on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
If the Company will not have sufficient liquidity resources, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its product candidates
or may be required to implement cost reduction measures and may be required to delay part of its development programs. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments for the values of assets and liabilities and their classification that may be necessary
in the event that the Company is no longer able to continue its operations as a going concern .

The statements herein and their implications are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties,
assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance levels of activity, or our achievements, or industry results
to be materially different from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation
to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Further information on potential factors that could affect
our business is described under the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on April 1, 2024, as subsequently amended. As used in this
quarterly report, the terms we , us , our , the Company and AppYea 
mean AppYea, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries Sleepx LTD and Ta-Nooma LTD unless otherwise indicated or as otherwise required by
the context. 

Overview 

AppYea,
Inc. is a digital health company, focused on the development of accurate wearable monitoring solutions to monitor and treat sleep apnea
and snoring and fundamentally improve quality of life. 

Our
solutions are based on our proprietary intellectual property portfolio comprised of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies
for the tracking, analysis, and diagnosis of vital signs and other physical parameters during sleep time, offering extreme accuracy at
affordable cost. 

AI
is a broad term generally used to describe conditions where a machine mimics cognitive functions associated with human
intelligence, such as learning and problem solving. Basic AI includes machine learning, where a machine uses algorithms
to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about a given phenomenon. The machine is trained 
using large amounts of data that provide it with the ability to learn how to perform the task. 

General
Background 

Snoring
is a general disorder caused due to repetitive collapsing and narrowing of the upper airway. Individuals with snoring problems are at
increased risk of accidental injury, depression and anxiety, heart disease and stroke. Currently available treatments include surgical
and non-surgical devices. 

According
to Fior Markets, a market intelligence company, the Global Anti-Snoring Treatment Market is expected to grow from USD 4.3 billion in
2020 to USD 8.6 billion by 2028, with a 9.07 CAGR between 2021 and 2028. While North America had the largest market share of 28.12 
in 2020, Asia-Pacific region is witnessing significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles in
emerging economies. 

Currently
available anti-snoring devices consist mainly of oral appliances that are recommended for use by patients suffering from snoring or obstructive
sleep apnea. These appliances are put before sleep and have a simple function of pushing either the lower jaw or the tongue forward.
This keeps the epiglottis parted from the uvula and prevents the snoring sound created by the vibration of soft tissues of palate. 

21 

Sleep
apnea is a severe sleep condition in which individuals frequently stop breathing in their sleeping, this leads to insufficient oxygen
supply to the brain and the rest of the body which, in turn may lead to critical problems. There are three main types of apnea: (i) Obstructive
Sleep Apnea OSA ), the most common form caused by the throat muscles relaxing during sleep; (ii) Central sleep apnea, which
occurs when the brain doesn t send the proper signals to the muscles that control the breathing; and (iii) complex sleep apnea
syndrome, which occurs when an individual suffers from both OSA and central sleep apnea. While OSA is a common disorder in the elderly
population, affecting approximately 13 to 32 of people aged over 65, sleep apnea can occur at any age and affects approximately 25 
of men and nearly 10 of women. 

In
2020, North America dominated the sleep apnea device market, as it accounted for 49 of the revenue, the global market size was valued
at USD 3.7 billion and is expected to expand by 6.2 CAGR, according to a report by Grand View Research Inc., reaching USD 6.1 billion
by 2028. 

The
global sleep apnea and snoring market is driven in large part by solutions that can be applied in at home-settings or healthcare settings,
as these tools will drive decisions regarding specific treatments and the associated outlays. However, despite advances in medical imaging
and other diagnostic tools, misdiagnosis remains a common occurrence. We believe that improved diagnoses and outcomes are achievable
through the adoption of AI-based decision support tools. 

Our
Products and Product Candidates 

Our
initial focus is on the development of supporting solutions utilizing our proprietary platform. Our current business plan focuses on
two principal devices and an App currently in development: 

AppySleep
 Biofeedback snoring treatment wristband, combined with the AppySleep App. 

The
AppySleep app uses unique algorithms developed by SleepX combined with sensors to monitor physiological parameters during sleep. Based
on real-time reactions, the wristband will vibrate, when necessary, in order to decrease the snoring and regulate breathing by gently
bringing the user to change his sleep position and thus ceasing the snoring event. 

The
AppySleep product is currently in serial manufacturing stage and sales. The new AppySleep IOS and Android versions were launched during
the third quarter of 2024. 

AppySleep
LAB Is a medical application, intended for downloading on a smartphone, and used to monitor breathing patterns in the sleep
and identify sleep apnea episodes without direct contact to the user. 

The
AppySleep LAB product is to begin calibration, following which we will file for 510(k) FDA approval. 

AppySleep
PRO is a wristband for the treatment of sleep apnea using biofeedback in combination with AppySleep LAB app. The unique algorithms
of AppySleep LAB, combined with the wristband sensors, monitor sleep apnea events and additional physiological parameters during sleep,
and when necessary, the wristband vibrates according to real time events, in order to decrease and cease sleep apnea events. 

The
AppySleep PRO and AppySleep LAB are currently in development stages, following which it would be ready to begin the testing stage in
preparation for filing for FDA approval. 

Our
Strategy 

We
started marketing of the AppySleep app and wristband in the first quarter of 2024. Concurrently, subject to raising additional
capital, we plan to file a 510(k) FDA submission for the AppySleep LAB app for the non-contact diagnosis of sleep apnea during 2025,
and an FDA process for AppySleep PRO for the treatment of sleep apnea during 2026. 

22 

Our
goal over the next five years is to establish our technology and related products as the gold standard for the targeted sectors. The
key elements of our strategy are as follows: 

Develop
and expand a balanced and diverse pipeline of products and product candidates. Our core platform technologies will include innovative
anti-snoring and sleep apnea related devices and product candidates in various development and clinical stages. We plan to add products
and product candidates to our pipeline by expanding our technologies being developed to additional indications and through investing
in new technologies, products and product candidates. By maintaining this multi-product approach, we aim to provide a broad and comprehensive
product offering, which we believe will result in multiple value inflection events, reduced risks to our potentially business associated
with a particular product or product candidate and increased return on investment. Furthermore, product candidates that we develop may
create attractive collaboration opportunities with diagnostics, medical devices and medical supplies companies. 

Maintain
a global, diverse network of specialists to accelerate knowledge synergies and innovation. We will utilize a global network of specialists
to identify large and growing patient populations with significant unmet needs, evaluate and prioritize potential technologies, assist
in designing development plans and diagnostic protocols and determine potential indications of our platform technologies to our target
patient populations in various territories. We believe that maintaining this diverse network of specialists and industry specialists
will allow us to continue to maximize knowledge and cost synergies, utilize shared commercial infrastructure across products, reduce
risks of development and commercialization delays to our overall business and leverage our current and future platform technologies and
technologies for additional products and product candidates. 

Establish
distribution channels to maximize the commercial potential of our products . We plan to seek out collaborative arrangements with major
healthcare providers and consumer specialists to facilitate market adoption of our product candidates. We believe that such institutions
are well positioned to directly benefit from improvements in accurate diagnosis and reduction of cost of care associated with the use
of our product candidates. We also believe that the marginal cost of our product candidates compared to potential savings will make it
economical for healthcare institutions to adopt our products regardless of whether or not additional costs of purchase of these products
will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs and commercial insurance companies. 

Through
cooperation with healthcare providers, we aim to develop and prove an economic model beneficial to them. In parallel, we intend selling
directly, through our website and other online webstores worldwide. Thereafter, we plan to engage with private insurance plans to develop
reimbursement programs encouraging the use of our product candidates. We expect that adoption rates of our product candidates will increase
if hospitals and other medical institutions are compensated, in full or in part, for additional costs incurred when purchasing our products. 

We
established a logistical distribution facility in the US. 

The
License Agreement 

Our
business derives from a licensing agreement entered into as of March 15, 2020, as subsequently amended (the License Agreement ),

Key
Financial Terms and Metrics 

The
following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial
statements. 

Revenues 

We
have generated 16,000 in revenues from product sales as of September 30, 2024. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

The
process of researching and developing our product candidates is lengthy, unpredictable, and subject to many risks. We expect to continue
incurring substantial expenses for the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates. We are unable, with any certainty,
to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those expenses will be incurred. The design and development of our devices will
consume a large proportion of our current, as well as projected, resources. 

24 

Our
research and development costs include costs are comprised of: 

internal recurring costs, such as personnel-related costs (salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation and other costs), materials
and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs attributable to research and development functions; and 

fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as programming, preclinical testing, manufacturing and related
testing and clinical trial activities. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other personnel-related costs
associated with executive, administrative and other support staff. Other significant general and administrative expenses include the
costs associated with professional fees for accounting, auditing, insurance costs, consulting and legal services, along with facility
and maintenance costs attributable to general and administrative functions. 

Financial
Expenses 

Financial
expenses consist primarily impact of exchange rate derived from re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items denominated in non-dollar
currencies. Other financial expenses include bank s fees and interest on long term loans . Financial income derives mainly from
change in derivative value of convertible loans.

Revenues.
 We recorded revenues of 1,000 and 16,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nil each of the corresponding
period in 2024. All revenues were from sales of our AppySleep wristband. 

Research
and Development Expenses , Research and development expenses increased from 34,000 and 50,000 during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to 159,000 and 316,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2024. The increase in each of the three and
nine month periods is primarily attributable to increased investment in intellectual property and development of our products. 

25 

Sales
and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased from 47,000 and 49,000 during each of the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023 to 153,000 and 310,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2024. The increase in each of the three and nine month
periods is primarily attributable to increased marketing efforts we undertook, since the beginning of the year, with respect to advance
sales of our AppySleep wristband through Amazon and through our website. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses increased from 261,000 and 1,128,000 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, to 298,000 and 797,000, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2024. The change is primarily attributable
to reallocation of cash and non-cash management expenses to research and development and to sales and marketing expenses. 

Profit
(loss) . loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were (512,000) and (1,575,000), respectively, and is primarily
attributable to non-cash stock based compensation expenses and change in fair value of convertible loans and warrant liability. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

From
inception, we have funded our operations from a combination of loans and sales of equity instruments. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 56,000 in cash resources and approximately 2,527,000 of liabilities, all of which are current
liabilities from financing. 

Management believes that funds on hand will enable us to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements through December 2024.
Accordingly, we need to raise additional operating capital in order to maintain operations as presently conducted and to realize our business plan. Without raising additional funds on an immediate basis, whether through the issuance of our securities,
licensing fees for our technology or otherwise, we will also not be able to maintain operations as presently conducted. As previously
disclosed in our periodic reports, we have been actively seeking additional capital. At the present time, we have no commitments for
financing and no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise capital on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Even if we
raise cash to meet our immediate working capital needs, our cash needs could be heavier than anticipated in which case we could be forced
to raise additional capital. Our auditors included a going concern qualification in their auditors report for the
year ended December 31, 2023 and for the succeeding quarters in 2024. Such going concern qualification may make it more
difficult for us to raise funds when needed. Moreover, the current economic situation may further complicate our capital raising efforts.
If we are unable to raise additional capital on an immediate basis, we may be forced to further curtail operations and either restructure
or cease operations entirely. 

AppYea
has experienced operating losses since its inception and had a total accumulated deficit of 7,901,000 as of September 30, 2024. We expect
to incur additional costs and require additional capital. We have incurred losses in nearly every year since inception. These losses
have resulted in significant cash used in operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our cash used in operations
was approximately 569,000 and 410,000, respectively. We need to continue and amplify our research and development efforts for our product
candidates (which are in various stages of development), strengthen our patent portfolio, establish operations processes and pursue FDA
clearance and international regulatory approvals as we continue to conduct these activities, we expect the cash needed to fund operations
to increase significantly over the next several years. 

The
following table provides a summary of operating, investing, and financing cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
respectively:

number of shares at a per share exercise price of 0.04, and additional 225,000 from public capital raised through the company
effective prospectus. In respect of the raise the investors were issued an aggregate of 83,899,953 shares of our common stock and
identical number of warrants and 10,500,000 are to be issued. The subscription proceeds are being used to upgrade the IOS design and
development of our biofeedback snoring treatment wristband (AppySleep product) as well as general corporate matters. 

26 

Our
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the
date of these consolidated financial statements. However, the Company has incurred substantial losses. Our current liabilities exceed
our current assets and available cash is not sufficient to fund the expected future operations. The Company is raising additional capital
through debt and equity securities in order to continue the funding of its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company
can raise enough funds or generate sufficient revenues to pay its obligations as they become due, which raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying value of assets or liabilities as a result
of this uncertainty. 

We
may seek to raise any additional capital through a combination of private or public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional
capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third
parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights, future revenue streams, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that
may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through private or public equity offerings, the ownership interest of our
existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely
affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 

Going
Concern 

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable
to continue in operation. We have a stockholders deficit of 2,166,000 and a working capital deficit of 2,440,000 on September
30, 2024 as well as negative operating cash flows. Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 includes an explanatory paragraph stating the Company has recurring losses and limited operations which raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, the Company
may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

27 

Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. As disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2024, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
at December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As
a result of our evaluation, we identified a material weakness in our controls related to segregation of duties and other immaterial weaknesses
in several areas of data management and documentation. Our management is composed of a small number of professionals resulting in a situation
where limitations on segregation of duties exist. Accordingly, and as a result of the material weakness identified above, we have concluded
that the control deficiencies result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
may not be prevented on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. We continue to employ and refine a structure in which
critical accounting policies, issues and estimates are identified, and together with other complex areas, are subject to multiple reviews
by executives. We expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable
future which we believe will mitigate the impact of the material weaknesses discussed above. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Except
for the material weakness noted above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

PART

 1. 
 LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS 

In
August 11, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Tel Aviv Magistrate s Court against our Chairman and majority shareholder, Boris Molchadsky,
G.P.I.S Ltd., an entity controlled by Mr. Molchadsky, Nexsense, Inc. (the former shareholder of SleepX Ltd.) and SleepX, Ltd., our subsidiary
(collectively, the Defendants [Civil lawsuit number 25441-08-22]. The suit was filed by a fund operating out of Israel.
A copy of the claim was served to the defendants only six months after it was submitted to court, on February 21, 2023. 

The
lawsuit is based on the alleged breach of partnership and loan agreements as well as other related allegations, including violation of
agreements reached in a mediation proceeding that took place in 2015. 

The
suit alleges that the Defendants, amongst other things, did not disclose to the plaintiff certain transactions to which the Plaintiff
was presumably entitled to compensation and hence the plaintiff demanded an accounting of the transactions and refund of amounts invested.
With respect to SleepX. the plaintiff alleged that it made a deal with Nexsense, Inc. which wasn t disclosed to the plaintiff,
while allegedly the technology and patents of Nexsense, Inc. were transferred to SleepX (which was established shortly before the reverse
merger between AppYea and SleepX), thus allegedly aimed to the concealment of assets from the plaintiff. 

On
July 24, 2023, the Defendants (except for Nexsense, Inc.) filed a statement of defense, denying the allegations and argued that the claim
should be dismissed, due to the statute of limitations, lack of cause of action, lack of jurisdiction, delay in filing the claim, and
respecting SleepX, also due to the lack of legal rivalry between SleepX and the plaintiff. 

In
addition, the Defendants submitted several preliminary requests to dismiss the claim outright, including a plea to dismiss the claim
on the grounds it was submitted to the magistrate court, which is not the competent court according to law, due to the economic nature
of the claim. Nexsense, Inc. submitted a request to dismiss the claim against it because it was not properly served under the law (given
the different service rules for defendants whose domicile is outside of Israel). 

28 

Recently,
the Magistrate s Court in Tel Aviv accepted the request regarding lack of material jurisdiction, and the claim was then transferred
to the economic department of the District Court in Tel Aviv. 

A
preliminary hearing was held on February 14, 2024. The presiding judge did not rule on the preliminary pleadings and urged the parties
to attempt mediation before the ruling. The parties are considering different mediators (which must be mutually agreed to) and following
