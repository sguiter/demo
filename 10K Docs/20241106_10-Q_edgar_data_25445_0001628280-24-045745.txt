 reporting segments: Crane Payment Innovations CPI and Security and Authentication Technologies SAT ). Our primary end markets include governments and a wide range of consumer related end markets including convenience merchandising (vending), retail and gaming. See Note 4, Segment Results for the relative size of these segments in relation to the total company (both net sales and total assets). 
 References herein to Crane NXT, we, us and our refer to Crane NXT, Co. and its subsidiaries, including when Crane NXT, Co. was named Crane Holdings, Co. unless the context implies otherwise. References to the Business refer to our business, including prior to the Separation (as defined below) when it was a business of Crane Holdings, Co. References herein to Holdings refer to Crane Holdings, Co. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Separation unless the context implies otherwise. 
 Separation 
 On April 3, 2023, Holdings was separated (the Separation into two independent, publicly-traded companies, Crane NXT, Co. and Crane Company SpinCo through a pro-rata distribution (the Distribution of all the issued and outstanding common stock of SpinCo to the stockholders of Holdings. As part of the Separation, the Aerospace Electronics, Process Flow Technologies and Engineered Materials businesses of Holdings were spun off to SpinCo. Also, as part of the Separation, Holdings retained the Payment and Merchandising Technologies business and was renamed Crane NXT, Co. on April 3, 2023. Following the consummation of the Separation, our common stock is listed under the symbol CXT on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Due to SpinCo s larger operations, greater tangible assets, greater fair value and greater net sales, in each case, relative to ours, among other factors, SpinCo was considered to be the accounting spinnor and therefore is the accounting successor to Holdings for accounting purposes, notwithstanding the legal form of the Separation. Therefore, following the Separation, our prior historical financial statements are comprised solely of combined carve-out financial statements representing only our operations, assets, liabilities and equity on a stand-alone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Holdings. 
 Prior to the Separation, Crane NXT employees and directors participated in Holdings equity incentive plans and received equity awards under those plans in the form of stock options, restricted share units, performance-based and time-based restricted share units and deferred stock units in respect of Holdings common shares. Crane NXT Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Condensed Financial Statements reflect compensation expense for these stock-based plans associated with the portion of the Holdings equity incentive plans in which Crane NXT employees and directors participated. 
 As a result of the Separation, all outstanding stock-based compensation awards of Holdings were exchanged for similarly valued stock-based compensation awards of either SpinCo, Crane NXT or both. The exchanged awards are subject to the same service vesting requirements as the original awards. The modification of the performance-based restricted share units resulted in a liability recorded upon Separation. The amount of the liability was million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Separation Agreements 
 On April 3, 2023, we entered into definitive agreements with SpinCo in connection with the Separation. The agreements set forth the terms and conditions of the Separation and provide a framework for our relationship with SpinCo following the Separation, including the allocation between us and SpinCo of our and SpinCo s assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Separation. These agreements include the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which contains certain key provisions related to the Separation, as well as a Transition Services Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement.

 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative in the Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Condensed Statements of Operations. 
 In the opinion of our management, the expense and cost allocations have been determined on a basis considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or for the benefit received by the Business during 2023 prior to the Separation. The amounts that would have been or will be incurred on a stand-alone basis could differ from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more or fewer employees or other factors. Management does not believe, however, that it is practicable to estimate what these expenses would have been had the Business operated as an independent entity, including any expenses associated with obtaining any of these services from unaffiliated entities. In addition, the future results of operations, financial position and cash flows could differ materially from the historical results presented herein. 
 Separation Costs . In connection with the Separation, we incurred expenses of million and million for the three-and-nine months ended September 30, 2023 recorded in Selling, general and administrative in the Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Condensed Statements of Operations. Expenses primarily consisted of professional service fees.

As of December 31, 2023, we had net outstanding receivables with SpinCo and its subsidiaries of million related to the Transition Services Agreement and million related to indemnification under the Tax Matters Agreement.

 million on a cash-free and debt-free basis, subject to customary purchase price adjustments . The amount paid, net of cash acquired, was million. We utilized million from our Revolving Facility (as defined in Note 13, Financing and cash on hand to fund the acquisition. In September 2024, we received 1.4 million related to the final working capital adjustment of the OpSec acquisition, resulting in net cash paid of million. 
 
 OpSec is a global leader in authentication and brand integrity with a heritage that spans four decades. OpSec serves brand owners, licensors, and media rights owners, helping them build intangible value and mitigate vulnerability across both physical and digital domains. OpSec also provides high-security and compliance solutions to governments. The acquisition of OpSec expands the Company s capabilities across the entire authentication value chain, creating a leading brand and product authentication platform. In connection with the acquisition of OpSec, we renamed our Crane Currency reportable segment to Security and Authentication Technologies, which consists of the Crane Currency business and the acquired OpSec business.

 Property, plant and equipment Other assets Intangible assets Goodwill Total assets acquired Total current liabilities Other liabilities Total assumed liabilities Net assets acquired 
 
 The amount allocated to other assumed liabilities includes a contingent liability of million related to a prior OpSec acquisition. The amount payable is contingent upon achievement of specific revenue targets and is capped at million. The contingency conditions expire at the end of 2026, at which point if the contingency conditions have not been met, no payment will occur. The contingent liability is measured at fair value. See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements for further details. 
 The amount allocated to goodwill reflects expected sales synergies, manufacturing efficiency and research and development. Goodwill from this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. 
 Customer relationships Developed technology Backlog Total acquired intangible assets 
 
 The intellectual property rights intangible asset category consists of trade names. The fair values of the trade names were determined by using an income approach , specifically the relief-from-royalty approach, which is a commonly accepted valuation approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset. Therefore, a portion of OpSec s earnings, equal to the after-tax royalty that would have been paid for the use of the asset, can be attributed to the Company s ownership. The trade names are being amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the economic pattern of benefits) over the estimated economic life of years. 
 
 The fair values of the developed technology intangible assets were also determined by the relief-from-royalty approach. Similarly, this approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the technology. Therefore, a portion of OpSec s earnings, equal to the after-tax royalty that would have been paid for the use of the technology, can be attributed to the Company s ownership of the technology. The technology assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the economic pattern of benefits) over the estimated economic life of to years.

 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders which have not yet been fulfilled.

We expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2024, in 2025 and the balance thereafter. 
 Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities 
 Contract assets represent unbilled amounts that typically arise from contracts for customized products or contracts for products sold directly to the U.S. government or indirectly to the U.S. government through subcontracts, where revenue recognized using the cost-to-cost method exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract assets are assessed for impairment and recorded at their net realizable value. Contract liabilities represent advance payments from customers. Revenue related to contract liabilities is recognized when control is transferred to the customer. We report contract assets, which are included within Other current assets in our Unaudited Consolidated and Condensed Balance Sheets, and contract liabilities, which are included within Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities on our Unaudited Consolidated and Condensed Balance Sheets, on a contract-by-contract net basis at the end of each reporting period.

 Our effective tax rates for the three-and-nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the prior year s comparable periods primarily due to the mix of non-U.S. earnings. 
 Our effective tax rates for the three-and-nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to the mix of non-U.S. earnings. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 of reported profits Pillar 2 that has been agreed upon by over 140 member jurisdictions including the United States. Pillar 2 addresses the risks associated with profit shifting to entities in low tax jurisdictions. We have adopted Pillar 2 and the impact of this adoption on our business was approximately million.

 a benefit in sales from the May 2024 OpSec acquisition of 32.3 million, or 9.1 , 
 core sales growth of 16.7 million, or 4.7 , driven primarily by higher core sales in Security and Authentication Technologies SAT as a result of favorable pricing and higher banknote volumes in our international currency business, and 
 favorable foreign currency translation of 1.6 million, or 0.5 . 
 Cost of sales increased by 44.8 million, or 23.9 , to 232.2 million in 2024.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 133.0 197.8 Investing activities (304.4) (16.1) Financing activities 115.8 (176.5) Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 2.4 (6.9) Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (53.2) (1.7) 
 
 Our operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities, when appropriate, to provide value to stockholders by reinvesting in existing businesses, by making acquisitions that will strengthen and complement our portfolio, by divesting businesses that are no longer strategic or aligned with our portfolio and where such divestitures can generate capacity for strategic investments and initiatives that further optimize our portfolio, by paying dividends and/or repurchasing shares, and by repaying prepayable debt. At any given time, and from time to time, we may be evaluating one or more of these opportunities, although we cannot assure you if or when we will consummate any such transactions. 
 Our current cash balance, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations along with our borrowings available under our Revolving Facility and our term facility, is expected to be sufficient to finance our short- and long-term capital requirements. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we drew down 310.5 million and repaid 160.5 million on our Revolving Facility. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 133.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 197.8 million during the same period last year. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased working capital requirements. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used for investing activities consists of cash used for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, and improving information systems. 
 Cash used for investing activities was 304.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 16.1 million in the comparable period last year. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily driven by the acquisition of OpSec. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities consists primarily of d ividend payments to shareholders, repayments of indebtedness, and proceeds from our credit facilities . 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 115.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash used for financing activities of 176.5 million in the comparable period last year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by higher net proceeds from the Revolving Facility used to fund the acquisition of OpSec, and lower repayments on the term facility.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in the information called for by this item since the disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 OpSec Acquisition . We completed the acquisition of OpSec on May 3, 2024. We are in the process of integrating OpSec s processes and controls over financial reporting and will be completed within the time provided by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC for a recently acquired business. As such, the scope of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting does not yet include OpSec. OpSec represented 14.3 of our consolidated total assets and 8.0 of our consolidated revenue as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Crane NXT s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Crane NXT s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Crane NXT s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Crane NXT in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that the information is accumulated and communicated to Crane NXT s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, Crane NXT s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in Crane NXT s internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with our evaluation thereof, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
