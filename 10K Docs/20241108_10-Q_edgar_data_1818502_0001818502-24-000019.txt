 KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS 
 
 We regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions, which may also be useful to an investor. The following tables and related discussion set forth key financial and operating metrics for the Company s operations as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The key performance metrics presented are for the OppLoans product only and exclude the SalaryTap and OppFi Card products. 
 
 Total Net Originations 
 
 We measure originations to assess the growth trajectory and overall size of our loan portfolio. There is a direct correlation between origination growth and revenue growth. We include both bank partner originations as well as those originated by us directly. Loans are considered to be originated when the contract is signed between us and the prospective borrower. The vast majority of our originations ultimately disburse to a borrower, but disbursement timing lags that of originations. Originations may be useful to an investor because they help understand the growth trajectory of our revenues.

Table of Contents 

 The following tables present total net originations (defined as gross originations net of transferred balance on refinanced loans), total retained net originations (defined as the portion of total net originations as defined above with respect to which the Company ultimately purchased a receivable from bank partners or originated directly), percentage of net originations by bank partners, and percentage of net originations by new loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Total net originations increased to 218.8 million and 587.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 195.7 million and 555.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 11.8 and 5.7 increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were a result of bank partners expansion into additional states, increased demand through certain marketing partners, and enhanced lead evaluation capabilities driving higher quality applications. Total retained net originations increased to 198.4 million and decreased to 540.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 190.7 million and 541.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 4.0 increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of the originations growth outpacing the growth in the percentage of loans retained by our bank partners, while the 0.3 decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributed to one of our bank partners retaining a higher percentage of loans originated in certain states. 
 
 Total net originations by our bank partners increased to 100.0 and 100.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 97.9 and 96.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company ceased directly originating loans and transitioned completely to a servicing / facilitation model for bank partners. 
 
 Total net originations of new loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 46.8 and 44.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 44.0 and 43.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases are a result of accelerating growth from our bank partners expansion into additional states, increased demand through certain marketing partners, and enhanced lead evaluation capabilities driving higher quality applications. 
 
 Ending Receivables 
 
 Ending receivables are defined as the unpaid principal balances of loans at the end of the reporting period. The following table presents ending receivables as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 Change 2024 2023 Ending receivables 413,714 415,933 (2,219) (0.5)

Table of Contents 

 Ending receivables decreased to 413.7 million as of September 30, 2024 from 415.9 million as of September 30, 2023. The 0.5 decrease was primarily driven by one of our bank partners retaining a higher percentage of loans originated in certain states. 
 
 Average Yield 
 
 Average yield represents total revenue from the period as a percent of average receivables and is presented as an annualized metric. Receivables are defined as the unpaid principal balances of loans. The following tables present average yield for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Average yield, annualized 133.9 128.5 4.2 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Average yield, annualized 131.8 127.3 3.5 
 
 Average yield increased to 133.9 and 131.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 128.5 and 127.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 4.2 and 3.5 increases were driven by a decrease in delinquent loans in the portfolio that were not accruing interest throughout the period as well as an increase in the average statutory rate from a relative shift away from states with lower interest rates. 
 
 Net Charge-Offs as a Percentage of Total Revenue and Net Charge-Offs as a Percentage of Average Receivables 
 
 Net charge-offs as a percentage of total revenue and net charge-offs as a percentage of average receivables represent total charge-offs from the period less recoveries as a percentage of total revenue and as a percentage of average receivables. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average receivables is presented as an annualized metric. Receivables are defined as the unpaid principal balances of loans. Our charge-off policy is based on a review of delinquent finance receivables on a loan-by-loan basis. Finance receivables are charged off at the earlier of the time when accounts reach 90 days past due on a recency basis, when we receive notification of a customer bankruptcy, or when finance receivables are otherwise deemed uncollectible. 
 
 The following tables present net charge-offs as a percentage of total revenue and as an annualized percentage of average receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 with both lower gross charge-offs and higher recoveries driving lower levels of net charge-offs compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average receivables decreased to 45.9 and 50.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 54.5 and 54.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decreases in net charge-offs as a percentage of average receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are a result of both lower gross charge-offs and higher recoveries driving lower levels of net charge-offs compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Auto-Approval Rate 
 
 Auto-approval rate is calculated by taking the number of approved loans that are not decisioned by a loan processor or underwriter (auto-approval) divided by the total number of loans approved. The following tables present auto approval rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Auto-approval rate 76.8 72.5 5.9 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Auto-approval rate 75.4 71.5 5.5 
 
 Auto-approval rate increased to 76.8 and 75.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 72.5 and 71.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases in auto-approval rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were driven by the continued application of algorithmic automation projects that streamline frictional steps of the origination process.

Total Revenue 
 
 Total revenue consists mainly of revenue earned from interest on receivables from outstanding loans based on the interest method. We also earn revenue from referral fees related primarily to our Turn-Up program, which represented 0.2 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Total revenue increased by 3.4 million, or 2.6 , to 136.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 133.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a higher average statutory rate for the loans in the portfolio as well as stronger payment activity driving a higher yield on the balances. 
 
 Change in Fair Value and Provision for Credit Losses on Finance Receivables 
 
 Commencing on January 1, 2021, we elected the fair value option on the OppLoans installment product. To derive the fair value, we utilize discounted cash flow analyses that factor in estimated losses and prepayments over the estimated duration of the underlying assets. Loss and prepayment assumptions are determined using historical loss data and include appropriate consideration of recent trends and anticipated future performance. Future cash flows are discounted using a rate of return that we believe a market participant would require based on the risk characteristics of the loans. We did not elect the fair value option on our SalaryTap and OppFi Card finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Change in fair value consists of gross charge-offs incurred in the period on the OppLoans installment product, net of recoveries, plus the change in the fair value on the installment loans portfolio. Change in fair value totaled 45.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was comprised of 55.6 million of gross charge-offs, offset by 8.8 million of recoveries and a positive fair value adjustment of 1.4 million, down from 57.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was comprised of 62.6 million of gross charge-offs and a negative fair value adjustment of 1.0 million, offset by 6.3 million of recoveries. The fair value adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 had a positive impact due to the increase in receivables over the period with a relatively flat fair value mark. 
 
 Provision for credit losses on finance receivables consists of gross charge-offs incurred in the period, net of recoveries, plus the change in allowance for credit losses for our SalaryTap and OppFi Card products. Provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased by 192 thousand to 3 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is largely attributed to very few remaining active SalaryTap finance receivables during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Revenue 
 
 Net revenue is equal to total revenue less the change in fair value and provision for credit losses on finance receivables. Net revenue increased by 15.5 million, or 20.5 , to 91.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 75.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to both the increase in total revenue and the decrease in change in fair value and provision for credit losses on finance receivables. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Expenses includes costs related to salaries and employee benefits, interest expense and amortized debt issuance costs, sales and marketing, customer operations, technology, products, and analytics, and general, administrative, and other expenses. 
 
 Expenses decreased by 4.0 million, or 6.7 , to 56.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 60.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by reduced payment processing fees related to a renegotiation, lower salary expenses from headcount efficiency, and lower capitalized technology amortization expense. The decrease was partially offset by higher professional fees. Expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased from 45.1 to 41.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income from Operations 
 
 Income from operations is the difference between net revenue and expenses. Income from operations increased by 19.5 million to 35.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from income from operations of 15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by higher total revenue, lower change in fair value and provision for credit losses on finance receivables, and lower expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the reasons stated above.

 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The fair value of warrant liabilities increased by 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These warrant liabilities arose with respect to warrants issued in connection with the initial public offering of FGNA and are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. 
 
 Income from Equity Method Investment 
 
 On July 31, 2024, OppFi entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to acquire 35 of the outstanding equity securities of Bitty. OppFi determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest in Bitty, but does exercise significant influence, and therefore the investment was accounted for under the equity method. OppFi s proportionate share of Bitty s earnings was 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income totaled 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income for both periods was comprised of 0.1 million in income related to the Company subleasing one floor of its office space. 
 
 Income Before Income Taxes 
 
 Income before income taxes is the sum of income from operations, the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, income from equity method investment, and other income. Income before income taxes increased by 18.4 million, or 114.8 , to 34.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons stated above. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 OppFi recorded an income tax expense of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is largely attributed to OppFi Inc. s increasing ownership in OppFi-LLC. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income is the difference between income before income taxes and income tax expense. Net income increased by 16.5 million to 32.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from net income of 15.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons stated above. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to OppFi Inc. 
 
 Net income attributable to OppFi Inc. was 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up from net income attributable to OppFi Inc. of 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income attributable to OppFi Inc. represents the income solely attributable to stockholders of OppFi Inc. As a result of the Company s Up-C structure, the underlying income or expense components that are attributable to OppFi Inc. are generally expense items related to OppFi Inc. s status as a public company, the income or expense for the change in fair value of warrant liabilities related to the Company s warrants, and the Company s approximate percentage interest in the noncontrolling interest. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the underlying income or expense components attributable to OppFi Inc. include OppFi Inc.'s percentage interest in the income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 8.7 million, partially offset by the loss on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1.4 million, income tax expense of 2.3 million, general and administrative expense of 0.6 million, and board fees of 0.1 million, for total net income attributable to OppFi Inc. of 4.3 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the underlying income or expense components that are attributable to OppFi Inc. include OppFi Inc. s percentage interest in the income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2.4 million and the gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 0.3 million, partially offset by income tax expense of 0.4 million and general and administrative expense and board fees of 0.1 million, for net income attributable to OppFi Inc. of 2.2 million. 
 
 Diluted Earnings per Share 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s outstanding shares of Class V Voting Stock were excluded in computing the diluted earnings per share as the inclusion of these shares would have had an antidilutive effect under the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, shares of the Company s Class V Voting Stock are assumed to

 Total Revenue 
 
 Total revenue consists mainly of revenue earned from interest on receivables from outstanding loans based on the interest method. We also earn revenue from referral fees related primarily to our Turn-Up program, which represented 0.2 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total revenue increased by 14.2 million, or 3.8 , to 390.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 376.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to higher average receivables balances throughout the period, a higher average statutory rate for the loans in the portfolio, and stronger payment activity driving a higher yield on the balances. 
 
 Change in Fair Value and Provision for Credit Losses on Finance Receivables 
 
 Commencing on January 1, 2021, we elected the fair value option on the OppLoans installment product. To derive the fair value, we utilize discounted cash flow analyses that factor in estimated losses and prepayments over the estimated duration of the underlying assets. Loss and prepayment assumptions are determined using historical loss data and include appropriate consideration of recent trends and anticipated future performance.

We did not elect the fair value option on our SalaryTap and OppFi Card finance receivables, which are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Change in fair value consists of gross charge-offs incurred in the period on the OppLoans installment product, net of recoveries, plus the change in the fair value on the installment loans portfolio. Change in fair value totaled 149.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was comprised of 174.6 million of gross charge-offs and a negative fair value adjustment of 0.7 million, offset by 25.8 of recoveries, down from 164.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was comprised of 178.5 million of gross charge-offs and a negative fair value adjustment of 5.2 million, offset by 19.2 million of recoveries. The fair value adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a negative impact due to the decrease in receivables over the period with a relatively flat fair value mark. 
 
 Provision for credit losses on finance receivables consists of gross charge-offs incurred in the period, net of recoveries, plus the change in allowance for credit losses for our SalaryTap and OppFi Card products. Provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased by 4.1 million to 34 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is largely attributed to very few remaining active SalaryTap finance receivables during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while provision for credit losses was increased during nine months ended September 30, 2023 to account for the then-impending closure of OppFi Card finance receivables. 
 
 Net Revenue 
 
 Net revenue is equal to total revenue less the change in fair value and provision for credit losses on finance receivables. Net revenue increased by 33.2 million, or 16.0 , to 240.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 207.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to both the increase in total revenue and the decrease in change in fair value and provision for credit losses on finance receivables. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Expenses includes costs related to salaries and employee benefits, interest expense and amortized debt issuance costs, sales and marketing, customer operations, technology, products, and analytics, and other general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Expenses increased by 1.0 million, or 0.6 , to 170.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 169.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by a one-time expense associated with the exit activities from the OppFi Card product, a one-time adjustment as a result of the reclassification of OppFi Card assets from held for sale to held for investment at amortized cost that offset expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and higher professional fees. The increase was partially offset by lower direct marketing spend expense resulting from a shift towards relatively lower-cost loans, reduced payment processing fees related to a renegotiation, and lower capitalized technology amortization expense. Despite the overall increase in expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased from 45.2 to 43.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Income from operations increased by 32.2 million to 69.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from income from operations of 37.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by higher total revenue and lower change in fair value and provision for credit losses on finance receivables, slightly offset by higher expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the reasons stated above. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The fair value of warrant liabilities decreased by 2.7 million and 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Income Tax Expense 
 
 OppFi recorded a provision for income taxes of 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is largely attributed to OppFi Inc. s increasing ownership in OppFi-LLC. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income is the difference between income before income taxes and income tax expense. Net income increased by 32.3 million to 69.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from net income of 37.5 million for the for the reasons stated above.

 Total cash and restricted cash increased by 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 driven by an increase in received payments relative to originations, partially offset by the cash consideration for the acquisition of the equity interest in Bitty. Finance receivables at fair value decreased by 1.9 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 mainly driven by one of our bank partners retaining a higher percentage of loans originated in certain states. Finance receivables at amortized cost, net, decreased by 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 due to the continued rundown of SalaryTap finance receivables. Equity method investment increased by 19.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 due to the acquisition of 35 of the outstanding equity securities in Bitty. Other assets decreased by 31 thousand as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 mainly due to a decrease in the operating lease right of use asset of 1.2 million and a decrease in the deferred tax asset of 3.5 million, partially offset by an increase in the settlement receivable of 3.2 million and an increase in property, equipment, and software of 1.1 million. 
 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by 4.0 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 driven by an increase in accrued expenses of 3.7 million and an increase in accounts payable of 0.2 million. Other liabilities decreased by 1.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 driven by a decrease in the operating lease liability of 1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in the tax receivable agreement liability of 0.1 million. Total debt decreased by 8.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 driven by a decrease in the term loan of 9.7 million and notes payable of 1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in utilization of revolving lines of credit of 2.6 million. Warrant liabilities decreased by 2.8 million due to the decrease in the valuation of the warrants as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Total stockholders equity increased by 26.3 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 driven by net income and stock-based compensation, partially offset by purchases of treasury stock and dividend issuance. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 We believe that the provision of non-GAAP financial measures in this report, including Adjusted EBT, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business and useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP measures, should not be considered an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. 
 
 Adjusted EBT and Adjusted Net Income 
 
 Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2024, for all periods presented, we have updated our presentation and calculation of Adjusted EBT, and the corresponding presentations and calculations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, to no longer add back debt issuance cost amortization. 
 
 Adjusted EBT is a non-GAAP measure defined as our GAAP net income adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as shown below, including income tax expense, other income, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and other addbacks and one-time expenses. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure defined as our Adjusted EBT less pro forma taxes for comparison purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBT and Adjusted Net Income are important measures because they allow management, investors, and our Board to evaluate and compare our operating results from period-to-period by making the adjustments described below. 
 
 Adjusted EBT and Adjusted Net Income exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because they are non-recurring items (such as severance), non-cash expenditures (such as changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities and expenses related to stock compensation), or are not related to our underlying business performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a comparative view of expenses that the Company expects to incur on an ongoing basis. 
 
 The following tables present reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except share and per share data). Certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts.

 Adjusted Earnings Per Share 
 
 Adjusted EPS is defined as adjusted net income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which represents shares of both classes of common stock outstanding, excluding 25,500,000 shares related to earnout units, and including the impact of dilutive securities, such as restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options. The earnout units were not earned pursuant to the earnout provisions of the Business Combination Agreement on or prior to July 21, 2024, the third anniversary of the closing date of the Company s business combination. Accordingly, on such date the earnout units and associated Class V Voting Stock were forfeited. We believe that presenting Adjusted EPS is useful to investors and others because, due to the Company s Up-C structure, Basic EPS calculated on a GAAP basis excludes a large percentage of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, which are Class V Voting Stock, and Diluted EPS calculated on a GAAP basis excludes dilutive securities, including Class V Voting Stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options, in any periods in which their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. Shares of the Company s Class V Voting Stock may be exchanged, together with OppFi Units, into shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. We believe that presenting Adjusted EPS is useful to investors and others because it presents the Company s Adjusted Net Income on a per share basis based on the shares of the Company s common stock that would be issued but for, and can be issued as a result of, the Company s Up-C structure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 To date, the funds received from operating income and our ability to obtain lending commitments have provided the liquidity necessary for us to fund our operations. 
 
 Maturities of our financing facilities are staggered over two years to help minimize refinance risk. 
 
 The following table presents our unrestricted cash and undrawn debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Unrestricted cash 44,838 31,791 Undrawn debt 199,450 192,333 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, OppFi had 44.8 million in unrestricted cash, an increase of 13.0 million from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, OppFi had an additional 199.4 million of unused debt capacity under its financing facilities for future availability, representing a 38 overall undrawn capacity, an increase from 192.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in undrawn debt was driven primarily by using excess cash to pay down debt on our term loan. Including total financing commitments of 525.0 million and cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet of 74.2 million, OppFi had approximately 599.2 million in funding capacity as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 OppFi believes that its unrestricted cash, undrawn debt and funds from operating income will be sufficient to meet its liquidity need s, including repayment of the current portion of its debt as it becomes due, for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. The Company s future capital requirements will depend on multiple factors, including its revenue growth, aggregate receivables balance, interest expense, working capital requirements, cash provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities and capital expenditures. 
 
 To the extent OppFi s unrestricted cash balances, funds from operating income and funds from undrawn debt are insufficient to satisfy its liquidity needs in the future, the Company may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when needed, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. 

CASH FLOWS 
 
 The following table presents cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (In thousands, except change) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 229,299 213,588 15,711 7.4 Net cash used in investing activities (170,607) (179,983) 9,376 (5.2) Net cash used in financing activities (58,402) (17,248) (41,154) 238.6 Net increase in cash and restricted cash 290 16,357 (16,067) (98.2) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 229.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was an increase of 15.7 million when compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 213.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities increased mainly due to higher net income. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 170.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was a decrease of 9.4 million when compared to net cash used in investing activities of 180.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to lower finance receivables originated and acquired and higher finance receivables repaid and recovered, partially offset by the cash consideration for the acquisition of the equity interest in Bitty. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 58.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was an increase of 41.2 million when compared to net cash used in financing activities of 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in distributions to members of OppFi-LLC, net payments of senior debt, repurchases of common stock, and dividends paid on common stock.

 FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 Our corporate credit facilities consist of term loans and revolving loan facilities that we have drawn on to finance our operations and for other corporate purposes. These borrowings are generally secured by all the assets of OppFi-LLC that have not otherwise been sold or pledged to secure our structured finance facilities, such as assets belonging to certain of the special purpose entity subsidiaries of OppFi-LLC SPEs ). In addition, we, through our SPEs, have entered into warehouse credit facilities to partially finance the purchase of participation rights in loans originated by our bank partners through our platform, which credit facilities are secured by the loans or participation rights. For a detailed discussion on financing arrangements refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following is a summary of OppFi s outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

LIBOR Transition 
 
 In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced plans to cease publication for all USD LIBOR tenors (except the one- and two-week tenors, which ceased on December 31, 2021) on June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative to LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. As of September 30, 2024, all of our LIBOR-based credit facilities have been transitioned to the SOFR. The replacement of LIBOR did not have any material effect on our liquidity or the financial terms of our credit facilities.

 As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Previously Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described below, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements of the Company as included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 
 
 As discussed in Part II, Item 9A in our 2023 Annual Report , management determined that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the existence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to information technology general controls associated with the Company s financially relevant information systems. Management determined that the Company s user access controls designed to ensure appropriate segregation of duties, adequate restriction of users and privileged access to the Company s financially relevant information systems were not operating effectively and the Company s user access control designed to ensure appropriate segregation of duties was not designed effectively. Management believes that compensating controls are in place and operating effectively to mitigate the risks associated with the identified material weakness as it is being remediated (as described below). 
 
 Remediation Plan for Previously Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is committed to remediating the material weakness described above as promptly as possible. Management believes that certain of the controls in question are designed effectively and that these controls, when operating effectively, will provide appropriate remediation of part of the material weakness. In particular, as part of its remediation plan, the Company is implementing comprehensive access control protocols in order to implement restrictions on user and privileged access to the Company s financially relevant information systems and will be providing internal control training for personnel involved in remediating this material weakness. In addition, management continues to design and implement new controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties. Management intends to test the ongoing operating effectiveness of the controls in future periods. The material weakness cannot be considered completely remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. The Company can provide no assurance that its remediation efforts described herein will be successful and that the Company will not have material weaknesses in the future. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the planned changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting described in Remediation Plan for Previously Identified Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting above, t here were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 On April 9, 2024, the Company announced that the Board had authorized the Repurchase Program for the Company to repurchase up to 20.0 million in the aggregate of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. Repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time, on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other methods, at the discretion of the management of the Company and in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and other applicable legal requirements, including restrictions in the Company s existing credit facilities. Repurchases may be made pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1, which would permit Common Stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares and the Repurchase Program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. For each share of Common Stock that the Company repurchases under the Repurchase Program, OppFi-LLC, the Company s direct subsidiary, will redeem one Class A common unit of OppFi-LLC held by the Company, decreasing the percentage ownership of OppFi-LLC by the Company and relatively increasing the ownership by the other members. The Repurchase Program will expire in April 2027. 
 The table below shows information regarding our monthly repurchases of our Class A Common Stock during the third quarter of 2024.

 ARTICLE X THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
 (a) Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Midtown Madison Management LLC as the administrative agent under this Agreement and the other Basic Documents, and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Midtown Madison Management LLC, as Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such action or to refrain from taking such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Basic Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Basic Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent agrees to act as such on the conditions contained in this Article X . The provisions of this Article X are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders, and neither Borrower nor its Affiliates shall have any rights as third-party beneficiaries of any of the provisions of this Article X other than as provided in this Article X . Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Basic Documents, by or through its agents, employees or sub-agents. 
 (b) In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Administrative Agent is acting solely on behalf of Lenders, and its duties are administrative in nature, and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed, any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for Lenders, other than as expressly set forth herein and in the other Basic Documents, or Borrower or its Affiliates. Administrative Agent shall have no duties, obligations or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the other Basic Documents. Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Basic 
 -75- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. Each Lender shall make its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower and Guarantors in connection with the extension of credit hereunder and shall make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Borrower and Guarantors. Except for information, notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to Lenders by Administrative Agent hereunder or given to Administrative Agent for the account of, or with copies for, Lenders, Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the Closing Date or at any time or times thereafter. If Administrative Agent seeks the consent or approval of any Lenders to the taking or refraining from taking any action hereunder, then Administrative Agent shall send prior written notice thereof to each Lender. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender in writing any time that the applicable percentage of Lenders have instructed Administrative Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto. 
 (c) Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys or agents shall be liable to any Lender for any action lawfully taken or omitted by them hereunder or under any of the other Basic Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith provided, that the foregoing shall not prevent Administrative Agent from being liable to the extent of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction on a final and nonappealable basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall be obligated on the terms set forth herein for performance of its express duties and obligations hereunder. Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made shall be to recover from the other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree promptly to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). In performing its functions and duties hereunder, Administrative Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account. Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents, the Receivables Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of Borrower or Guarantors. Administrative Agent shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions, or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Basic Documents, the Receivables Documents or the financial condition of Borrower or Guarantors, or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. Administrative Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the other Basic Documents Administrative Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and Administrative Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any action or withholding any approval under any of the Basic Documents until it shall have received such instructions from the 
 -76- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

applicable percentage of Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents in accordance with the instructions of the applicable percentage of Lenders and, notwithstanding the instructions of Lenders, Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it, in good faith, believes that such action exposes Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys or agents to any personal liability unless Administrative Agent receives an indemnification satisfactory to it from Lenders with respect to such action. 
 (d) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or any telephone message or other communication (including any writing, telecopy, email or other electronic communication) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement, any of the other Basic Documents, or any of the Receivables Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. 
 (e) Each Lender, severally and not (i) jointly or (ii) jointly and severally, agrees to reimburse and indemnify and hold harmless Administrative Agent and its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys and agents (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower), ratably according to their respective Pro Rata Share in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this subsection of the total outstanding Obligations (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Advances shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share immediately prior to such date of the total outstanding Obligations), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys or agents in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents provided , however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or disbursements to the extent resulting from Administrative Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction on a final and non-appealable basis. The obligations of Lenders under this Article X shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 (f) With respect to the Advances made by it, if any, Midtown Madison Management LLC and its successors as Administrative Agent shall have, and may exercise, the same rights and powers under the Basic Documents, and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities, as and to the extent set forth in the Basic Documents, as any other Lender. The terms Lenders or Required Lenders or any similar terms shall include Administrative Agent in its individual 
 -77- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

capacity as a Lender. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of lending, banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with, Borrower, Guarantors, or any their Affiliates as if it were not acting as Administrative Agent pursuant hereto. 
 (g) Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all or part of its functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower if Administrative Agent and its Affiliates cease to be a Lender hereunder pursuant to an assignment in accordance with Section 11.04 . Such resignation shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Administrative Agent of appointment pursuant to this Article X(g) , or as otherwise provided below. Upon any such notice of resignation pursuant to this Article X(g) , Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent provided, that such successor shall be an Eligible Assignee hereunder. If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, who shall serve as Administrative Agent until such time as Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above provided that any such successor Administrative Agent shall constitute an Eligible Assignee. If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the resignation shall become effective and Required Lenders thereafter shall perform all the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder, until such time, if any, as Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent under the Basic Documents by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and, upon the earlier of such acceptance or the effective date of the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Basic Documents provided that any indemnity rights or other rights in favor of such retiring Administrative Agent shall continue after and survive such resignation and succession. After any retiring Administrative Agent s resignation as Administrative Agent under the Basic Documents, the provisions of this Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Basic Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. 
 (h) Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, where required by the express terms of this Agreement, a greater number of Lenders) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or of the other Basic Documents relating to the Collateral, and the exercise by Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, where so required, such greater number of Lenders) of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of Lenders and Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to (i) act as the disbursing and collecting agent for Lenders with respect to all payments and collections 
 -78- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

arising in connection herewith and with the Basic Documents in connection with the Collateral (ii) execute and deliver each Basic Document relating to the Collateral and accept delivery of each such agreement delivered by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (iii) act as collateral agent for Lenders for purposes of the perfection of all security interests and Liens created by such agreements and all other purposes stated therein (iv) manage, supervise and otherwise deal with the Collateral (v) take such action as is necessary or desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the security interests and Liens created or purported to be created by the Basic Documents relating to the Collateral and (vi) except as may be otherwise specifically restricted by the terms hereof or of any other Basic Document, exercise all right and remedies given to such Administrative Agent and Lenders with respect to the Collateral under the Basic Documents relating thereto, at law, or otherwise. Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Administrative Agent, for the benefit the of Lenders, upon any Collateral covered by the Basic Documents (x) upon termination of this Agreement and the payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification Obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted) (y) constituting Collateral being sold or disposed of or (z) constituting Collateral leased to Borrower under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire and which has not been, and is not intended by Borrower to be, renewed or extended. So long as no Event of Default then exists, upon receipt by Administrative Agent of confirmation from the requisite percentage of Lenders of its authority to release any particular item or types of Collateral covered by this Agreement or the other Basic Documents, and upon at least two (2) Business Days prior written request by Borrower (which notice shall not be required in connection with the release of the Liens granted pursuant to the Basic Documents on the Term Loan Termination Date upon payment in full in cash of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been asserted)), Administrative Agent shall authorize the release of the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, herein or pursuant hereto upon such Collateral provided , however, that Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in Administrative Agent s opinion, would expose Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty (other than that such Collateral is free and clear, on the date of such delivery, of any and all Liens arising from such Person s own acts), and such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of Borrower in respect of) all interests retained by Borrower, including, without limitation, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral covered by this Agreement or the Basic Documents. Administrative Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or any other Person to assure that the Collateral covered by this Agreement or the other Basic Documents exists or is owned by Borrower or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, enforced or maintained or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Administrative Agent in this Article X(h) or in any of the Basic Documents it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral covered by this 
 -79- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

Agreement or the other Basic Documents, or any act, omission or event related thereto, Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its discretion, given Administrative Agent s own interest in Collateral covered by this Agreement or the Basic Documents and Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to any of the other Lenders provided , that Administrative Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with financial assets for its own account. 
 (i) Each Lender hereby appoints Administrative Agent as agent for the purpose of perfecting Lenders security interest in Collateral which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other than Administrative Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall hold such Collateral for purposes of perfecting a security interest therein for the benefit of the Lenders, notify Administrative Agent thereof and, promptly upon Administrative Agent s request therefor, deliver such Collateral to Administrative Agent or otherwise act in respect thereof in accordance with Administrative Agent s instructions. 
 (j) Each Lender agrees that it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or any other Basic Document or to realize upon any Collateral security for the Advances or other Obligations it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of the Basic Documents. 
 (k) In the event Administrative Agent requests the consent of a Lender and does not receive a written denial thereof within five (5) Business Days after such Lender s receipt of such request, then such Lender will be deemed to have given such consent so long as such request contained a notice stating that such failure to respond within five (5) Business Days would be deemed to be a consent by such Lender. 
 (l) In the event Administrative Agent requests the consent of a Lender in a situation where such Lender s consent would be required and such consent is denied, then Administrative Agent may, at its option, require such Lender to assign its interest in the Advance to Administrative Agent for a price equal to the then outstanding principal amount thereof due such Lender plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such Lender, which principal, interest and fees will be paid to the Lender when collected from Borrower. In the event that Administrative Agent elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article X(l) , Administrative Agent will so notify such Lender in writing within forty-five (45) days following such Lender s denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to Administrative Agent no later than five (5) calendar days following receipt of such notice. 
 (m) As a matter of administrative convenience, as requested from time to time by a Lender, Administrative Agent may, either directly, or through one or more of its Affiliates, on behalf of one or more Lenders, disburse funds to Borrower for an Advance that is otherwise required to be funded pursuant to Section 2.04(a) by such Lender by advancing the amount thereof on behalf of such Lender (on terms to be agreed upon between Administrative Agent and such Lender (each such advance, an Administrative Agent Advance )). With respect to each Administrative Agent Advance, Administrative Agent or its Affiliate(s) shall have, subject to the 
 -80- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

agreed upon terms related to such Administrative Agent Advance, the right to set off against the amounts of any payments or distributions to be made to such Lender hereunder, the entire amount of such Administrative Agent Advance, together with any agreed upon interest or fees thereon, until such Administrative Agent Advance is paid in full. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article X(m) , or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Basic Documents, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article X(m) , shall be deemed to require Administrative Agent or its Affiliates to advance funds on behalf of any Lender, whether in the form of an Administrative Agent Advance, or otherwise, or to relieve any Lender from such Lender s obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, or to prejudice any rights that Administrative Agent or Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 (n) If Administrative Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Administrative Agent from Borrower and such related payment is not received by Administrative Agent, then Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender without interest, set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. 
 (o) If Administrative Agent is, at any time, required by Governmental Rule to return any amount received by Administrative Agent under this Agreement to Borrower, or to pay any such amount to any other Person (each such amount, an Avoided Transfer ), then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, Administrative Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender and shall promptly deliver the amount of such Avoided Transfer to the Person entitled thereto, in accordance with the requirements of applicable Governmental Rules.

 Section 11.02 Waivers Amendments. 
 (a) No Deemed Waivers Remedies Cumulative . No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective 
 -82-

unless the same shall be permitted under Section 11.02(b) , and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of any Advances shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
 (b) Amendments . Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by (a) the Borrower, (b) the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) or (c) if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected, the Administrative Agent provided that no such agreement, amendment, waiver, or modification that attempts to do any of the following shall be effective unless consented to by the Lenders affected thereby referenced below (including, in each instance, any initial Lender that is a Defaulting Lender) 
 (i) increase the Term Loan Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender 
 (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Advance or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the default rate provided in Section 2.09(b or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest or fees at the default rate as set forth therein 
 (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Advance, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Term Loan Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby 
 (iv) change Section 2.12(d) without the consent of each Lender affected thereby 
 (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of the term Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender

being secured by all or substantially all of the collateral security thereto, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented 
 and provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (1) no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Term Loan Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, (2) if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical nature, in each case, in any provision of the Basic Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision, and (3) guarantees, collateral security documents and related documents executed by the Borrower or the Guarantor in connection with this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and may be amended, supplemented or waived without the consent of any Lender if such amendment, supplement or waiver is delivered in order to (x) comply with local law or advice of local counsel, (y) cure ambiguities, omissions, mistakes or defects or (z) cause such guarantee, collateral security document or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Basic Documents.

 -85- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

indemnification (a Third Party Claim ), specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim and, if known, the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of the Third Party Claim, provided that failure to promptly give such notice shall only limit the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the actual prejudice, if any, suffered by the Indemnifying Party as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of any Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party s election to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed such defense, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim as contemplated herein, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at its sole expense unless (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such action, suit or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there are one or more legal defenses available to it which are in conflict with those available to the Indemnifying Party and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel in connection with such conflicting defenses (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party solely in connection with such conflicting defenses). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.03(c) , the Indemnified Party may continue to defend such claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party may still participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party s cost and expense provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.03(c) , the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one counsel for the Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim and a single local counsel in each jurisdiction where local counsel is reasonably required. In the event that the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.03(c) , the Indemnified Party will not consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim, without the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.03(c) , the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, such claim, provided that the consent of the Indemnified Party is not so required if the sole relief provided by such settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of any judgment consists of monetary obligations that are paid by the Indemnifying Party and contains no admission of liability on the part of the Indemnified Party. In any such Third Party Claim, the party responsible for the defense of such claim hereunder shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, keep such other party informed as to the status of such claim, including all settlement negotiations and offers. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.03(c) , the Indemnifying 
 -86- 
 OppLoans Conformed Credit Agreement 
 #227178428 

Party shall make available to the Indemnified Party and its attorneys and other representatives all relevant books, records, documents and other materials reasonably required by the Indemnified Party or its representatives and attorneys for use in contesting any Third Party Claim, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of all such claims provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11.03(c) will require the Indemnifying Party to provide information that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege applicable to any such information. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.03(c) , the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys and other representatives all relevant books, records, documents and other materials reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party or its representatives and attorneys for use in contesting any Third Party Claim, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of all such claims provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11.03(c) will require the Indemnified Party to provide information that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege applicable to any such information.

 (e) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc . To the extent permitted by applicable Governmental Rules, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Advance or the use of the proceeds thereof.

 (c) Each Borrower states and acknowledges that (i) under this Agreement, the Borrowers desire to utilize their borrowing potential on a consolidated basis to the same extent possible as if they were merged into a single corporate entity and that this Agreement reflects the establishment of credit facilities that would not otherwise be available to the Borrowers if each Borrower were not jointly and severally liable for payment of the Obligations (ii) it has determined that it will benefit specifically and materially from the advances of credit contemplated by this Agreement (iii) it is both a condition precedent to Administrative Agent s obligations hereunder and a desire of the Borrowers that each Borrower execute and deliver to Administrative Agent this Agreement and (iv) the Borrowers have requested and bargained for the structure and terms of and security for the advances contemplated by this Agreement. Each Borrower agrees if its joint and several liability hereunder, or if any security interests securing the joint and several liability, would, but for the application of this Section, be unenforceable under applicable law, then the joint and several liability and each security interests is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent that would not cause the joint and several liability or security interests to be unenforceable under applicable law, and the joint and several liability and the security interest is treated as having been automatically amended accordingly at all relevant times. 
 (d) To the extent that any Borrower, under this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repays any of the Obligations constituting Loans made to another Borrower or other Obligations incurred directly and primarily by any other Borrower (an Accommodation Payment ), then the Borrower
