 , the Company Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ), which requires companies to estimate a current expected credit loss CECL for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, including commercial mortgage loans, in their consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted each period for changes in expected credit losses. This replaces prior GAAP which required losses to be recognized as incurred. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective method, therefore, the results for reporting periods prior to January 1, 2023 remain unadjusted and reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded a increase to accumulated deficit with offsets on the consolidated balance sheet as noted below. 

Liabilities: 

Accrued expenses and other liabilities 

The allowance for credit losses is recorded in accordance with ASU 2016-13, and is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held-for-investment on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are recognized through net income (loss) on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss experience, current portfolio, market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration of each respective loan. All loans held-for-investment within the Company s portfolio have some amount of expected loss to reflect the GAAP principal underlying the CECL model that all loans have some inherent risk of loss, regardless of credit quality, subordinate capital or other mitigating factors. The Company s loans typically include commitments to fund incremental proceeds to its borrowers over the life of the loan. Those future funding commitments are also subject to an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses related to future loan fundings is recorded as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, and not as an offset to the related loan balance. This allowance for credit losses is estimated using the same process outlined below for the

first mortgage loans to a third party. Under the loan participation agreement, in the event of default by the underlying mortgagor, any amounts paid are first allocated to the third party before any amounts are allocated to the Company s subordinate interest. The Company, as the directing participant in the loan participation agreement, is entitled to exercise, without the consent of the third party, each of the consent approval and control rights under the applicable underlying mortgage loan documents with a few exceptions. The Company requires the third party s approval for any modification or amendment to the loan, a bankruptcy plan for an underlying mortgagor where the third party would incur an out-of-pocket loss, or any transfer of the underlying mortgaged property if the Company s approval is required by the underlying mortgage documents. The Company remains the directing participant unless certain conditions are met related to losses on the property or if the mortgagor is an affiliate of the Company. In the former case, the Company may post cash or short-term U.S. government securities as collateral to retain the rights of the directing participant. The third party, as the senior participation interest holder, receives interest and principal payments from the borrower until they receive the amounts to which they are entitled. All expenses or losses on the underlying mortgages are allocated first to the Company and then to the third party. If the underlying mortgage is in default, the Company will have the option to purchase the third party s participation interest and remove it from the loan participation agreement. The financing or transfer of a portion of a loan by the non-recourse sale of a senior interest in the loan through a participation agreement generally does not qualify as a sale under GAAP. Therefore, in this instance, the Company presents the whole loan as an asset and the loan participation sold as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until the loan is repaid. The obligation to pay principal and interest on these liabilities is generally based on the performance of the related loan obligation. The gross presentation of loan participations sold does not impact stockholders equity or net income.

 office properties through non-judicial foreclosure transactions. The underlying loan was subject to the loan participation agreement. Upon foreclosure, the Company is still subject to the participation payments to the third party.

If the calculated monthly payment exceeds the interest due under the participation agreement, the excess is paid to the third party and recorded as a reduction of past interest due first and then as a reduction of the principal. If the calculated monthly payment is less than the interest due under the participation agreement, the shortfall is accrued as interest payable. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the calculated monthly payment was and the interest due under the participation agreement was . As a result, the excess of resulted in a paydown of past interest due.

The following describes the Company s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments: The estimated fair values of restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents were based on the bank balance and was a Level 1 fair value measurement. 

 The estimated fair value of commercial mortgage loans, net is a Level 3 fair value measurement. The majority of the loans are floating rate and as such the interest rates on such loans reflect the current interest rate spreads. Additionally, since the loans have a short duration to maturity years), are not delinquent or impaired (except for loans impaired as of September 30, 2024 and loans impaired as of December 31, 2023, for which an asset-specific CECL reserve has been recorded) and are expected to return to par, the Advisor determined the amortized cost, less allowance for credit losses, is the best estimate of fair value for all loans. The allowance for credit losses includes the analytical portion as well as the asset-specific component of the CECL reserve. 

 For the impaired loans, the CECL reserve was recorded based on the Company s estimation of the fair value of the loans aggregate underlying collateral as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , as applicable. These loans are therefore measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. The Company estimated the fair value of these loans by considering a variety of inputs including property performance, market data, and comparable sales, as applicable. The significant unobservable input used is the exit capitalization rate assumption used to forecast the future sale price of the underlying real estate collateral, which ranged from to and had weighted average of . The estimated fair values of repurchase agreements commercial mortgage loans, credit facility payable and loan participations sold are Level 3 fair value measurements based on expected present value techniques. This method discounts future estimated cash flows using rates the Company determined best reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for repurchase agreements, credit facilities and loan participations sold with similar characteristics and credit quality. The carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value as the fair value of these instruments is not materially sensitive to shifts in market interest rates because of the floating interest rates on these instruments.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Words such as may, could, should, expect, intend, plan, goal, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, variables, potential, continue, expand, maintain, create, strategies, likely, will, would and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but reflect the intent, belief or current expectations of the management of InPoint Commercial Real Estate Income, Inc. (which we refer to herein as the Company, we, our or us based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, the economy and other future conditions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we caution stockholders not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the factors listed and described under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024 (the Annual Report and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, some of which are briefly summarized below: 
 We have paid past distributions from sources other than cash flows from operating activities, including from offering proceeds, which reduces the amount of cash we ultimately have to invest in assets, and some of our distributions have not been covered by net income; if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions, some or all of our distributions may again be paid from these other sources, and if our net income does not cover our distributions, those distributions will dilute our stockholders equity; 

There is no current public trading market for our common stock, and we do not expect that such a market will ever develop. Therefore, repurchase of shares by us will likely be the only way for stockholders to dispose of their shares, and our SRP is currently suspended; 

Even if our stockholders are able to sell their shares pursuant to our SRP in the future, or otherwise, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares; 

Our Advisor and our Sub-Advisor may face conflicts of interest in allocating personnel and resources between their affiliates; 

None of our agreements with our Advisor, our Sub-Advisor or any affiliates of our Advisor or Sub-Advisor were negotiated at arm s-length; and 

If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected. 

Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our management s view only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results except as required by applicable law. We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions created by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. 
 The following discussion and analysis relate to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. You should read the following discussion and analysis along with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 All dollar amounts are stated in thousands unless otherwise noted, except share data. 
 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed on September 13, 2016 to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, including (a) primarily floating-rate first mortgage loans, and (b) subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans, and (ii) floating-rate CRE securities such as CMBS and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We are externally managed by our Advisor, an indirect subsidiary of IREIC. Our Advisor has engaged the Sub-Advisor, a subsidiary of Sound Point CRE Management, LP, to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us. 
 28 

We have operated in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. 
 For a discussion of the history of the Company and its Private Offering, IPO, Second Public Offering and Preferred Stock Offering, please see Note 1 Organization and Business Operations in the notes to our consolidated financial statements above. The IPO and the Second Public Offering are collectively referred to herein as the Public Offerings . 
 Recent Developments 
 In response to inflationary pressures, in 2022 the Federal Reserve began raising its federal funds rate target range and indicated that, due to the persistent high rate of inflation, it would continue to increase rates until a 2 inflation rate is achieved. The Federal Reserve has also been conducting monetary tightening by increasing the sale of bonds it had purchased on the open market. During the third quarter of 2023, the Federal Reserve paused its increase in interest rates to evaluate the impact that the rate increases have had on inflation. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds 50 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and indicated that an additional 50 basis point decrease may occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect that the impact of these rate decreases will be positive for the commercial real estate market as the decrease in debt service cost will improve property performance. 
 We did not originate any new loans in 2023 or during the first nine months of 2024 as we chose to focus on maintaining our liquidity. We anticipate this to continue through the remainder of 2024. The commercial real estate lending market tightened as the Federal Reserve raised rates and lenders concerns over property performance increased. Concerns over office properties continue as tenants evaluate the amount of space they need with more employees working from home. In general, property valuations have decreased as capitalization rates for commercial real estate assets have increased with overall interest rates. We anticipate this will begin to improve as the market adjusts to the lower interest rates. 
 We continue to evaluate all loans on a quarterly basis and assign our internal risk rating with the majority of our loans continuing to perform as expected. While there has been some increase in competition for new loans in the first nine months of 2024, refinancing risk continues to be a focus. As such, for our CECL reserve, we have placed additional focus on loans with maturity dates up to nine months from the quarter end to determine if the collateral value would be sufficient to cover the outstanding loan principal balance and have recorded an asset-specific CECL reserve when necessary. 
 Q3 2024 Highlights 
 Operating Results: 
 Net loss attributable to common stockholders was 0.9 million, or 0.09 per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which included 3.7 million in provision for credit losses. 

During the third quarter of 2024, we paid an annual gross distribution rate of 1.25 per common share, which represents an annualized rate of 7.6 on our aggregate NAV of 16.4992 as of September 30, 2024. Holders of Class D and Class T shares of common stock received less than the gross distribution amount after the deduction of stockholder servicing fees applicable to those classes. 

Loan Portfolio: 
 We originated no loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

We acquired legal title to two office properties located in Addison, TX through non-judicial foreclosure transactions. The properties were previously collateralized by a senior loan with an amortized cost basis of 24.4 million with a CECL reserve of 0.3 million at the time of the acquisition. The properties were recorded at 24.0 million based on the estimated fair value at acquisition. 

We had 2.6 million in advances on previously originated loans and loan repayments of 6.4 million resulting in a 6.5 decrease in our loan portfolio to 640.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease also includes 13.7 million related to the sale of a loan, 3.7 million of provision for credit losses and a loan transferred on foreclosure to real estate owned of 24.4 million. 

27 out of our 30 loans were current on their contractual interest payments with no interest deferrals during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

29 

As of September 30, 2024, 2 out of our 30 loans were placed on nonaccrual status. After being placed on nonaccrual status, any cash collected, including any interest payments, on such loans is applied against their principal balance. 

Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Disclosures discussing all significant accounting policies are set forth in our Annual Report under the heading Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of changes to our significant accounting policies for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Portfolio 
 Our strategy is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE debt that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt. 
 The charts below summarize our debt investments portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, our total investment portfolio by investment type, including real estate owned REO ), and our loan portfolio by collateral type and geographical region as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

The changes in our loan portfolio by property type and by region as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 were primarily due to sale of a loan, transfer of a loan to REO upon foreclosure, and loans that were repaid by borrowers in ordinary course.

(1) All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. All-in yield also excludes the all-in yield for loans placed on nonaccrual status. All-in yield is calculated using the spread plus the values of the indices as of September 30, 2024. 

The decrease in the size of our portfolio is primarily due to loan payoffs, foreclosure of a loan, and a sale of a loan with no new loans originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the all-in yield was primarily driven by the loans placed on nonaccrual status.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total borrowings of 418,765 (which is net of 0 unamortized debt issuance costs) and 457,438 (which is net of 0 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we had weighted average borrowings of 472,163 and 562,396 and weighted average borrowing costs of 7.8 and 7.4 , respectively. 
 Real Property 
 On July 2, 2024, we acquired legal title to two office properties located in Addison, TX through non-judicial foreclosure transactions. The properties were previously collateralized by a senior loan with an amortized cost basis of 24,411 that was risk rated 5 with a CECL reserve of 281 at the time of the acquisitions. The acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , and we intend to hold these properties as real estate held for use with the intent to eventually sell when the market improves. The properties were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at 24,035 based on the estimated fair value at acquisition. The fair market value estimate was determined based on appraisals performed by an independent third-party appraiser. The acquisitions resulted in a CECL reserve charge-off of 855 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

(2) Includes the effect of amortization of premium or accretion of discount. 

(3) Interest income excludes 500 and 172 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to bank deposits not included in the loan portfolio. Interest expense excludes 360 of participation payments related to the REO. 

(4) Calculated as annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value. 

(5) Calculated by dividing total average interest-bearing liabilities by total average equity (total average interest-earning assets less total average liabilities). 

(6) Calculated by taking the sum of (i) the net interest spread multiplied by the average leverage and (ii) the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets. 

The change in our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was due to loan maturities and foreclosure. The change in the weighted average levered yield was primarily due to the loans that were placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Revenue from Real Estate 
 Our revenue from real estate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,274 and 4,472, respectively. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the sale of the Renaissance O Hare in September 2023, partially offset by an increase in revenue due to the acquisition of two properties in July 2024. 
 Net Operating Expenses 
 Net operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following:

 Net Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net income was 615 and 4,992, respectively. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income caused by the loans on nonaccrual status and a larger provision for credit losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net income (loss) was 9,004 and (5,722), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to the loss on the sale of the Renaissance O Hare recognized in 2023 and a comparatively larger provision for credit losses recognized in the nine months ending September 30, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
 We use Funds from Operations FFO ), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO. 
 Due to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives IPA ), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations MFFO ), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. 
 The IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 We define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. We also adjust FFO for gains or losses on preferred stock repurchases because we do not consider these gains or losses to be a measure of our operating performance. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature. 
 38 

Because MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments. 
 Our presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance. 
 Neither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO. 
 Our FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:

Net Asset Value 
 Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares. The Advisor is responsible for reviewing and confirming our NAV, as well as overseeing the process around the calculation of our NAV, in each case, as calculated by the independent valuation advisor. See Valuation Guidelines below for further information regarding our valuation policies used to determine our NAV.

(1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, and Class D shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class T, Class S, and Class D shares. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued under GAAP 645 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class T and Class D shares sold. As of September 30, 2024, we had not sold any Class S shares and, therefore, we had not accrued any stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to Class S shares. The Dealer Manager does not retain any of these fees, all of which are retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers.

Valuation Guidelines 
 Our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, has adopted valuation guidelines that contain a comprehensive set of methodologies to be used by our Advisor, with the assistance of our Sub-Advisor, and our independent valuation advisor in connection with estimating the values of our assets and liabilities for purposes of our NAV calculation. From time to time, our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, may adopt changes to the valuation guidelines if it (1) determines that such changes are likely to result in a more accurate reflection of NAV or a more efficient or less costly procedure for the determination of NAV without having a material adverse effect on the accuracy of such determination or (2) otherwise reasonably believes a change is appropriate for the determination of NAV. In connection with carrying out its responsibility to determine our NAV, our Advisor may delegate certain tasks to our Sub-Advisor. Our Advisor, however, is ultimately responsible for the NAV determination process. 
 The calculation of our NAV is intended to be a calculation of the value of our assets less our outstanding liabilities for the purpose of establishing a purchase and repurchase price for our shares of common stock and may differ from our financial statements. NAV is not a measure used under GAAP and the valuations of and certain adjustments made to our assets and liabilities used in the determination of NAV will differ from GAAP. 
 Our Advisor calculates the fair value of our assets in accordance with our valuation guidelines. Because these fair value calculations involve significant professional judgment in the application of both observable and unobservable attributes, the calculated fair value of our assets may differ from their actual realizable value or future fair value. Furthermore, no rule or regulation requires that we calculate NAV in a certain way. While we believe our NAV calculation methodologies are consistent with standard industry principles, there is no established practice among public REITs, whether listed or not, for calculating NAV in order to establish a purchase and repurchase price. As a result, other public REITs may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine NAV. 
 Our Independent Valuation Advisor 
 With the approval of our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, we have engaged BDO USA, P.C. to serve as our independent valuation advisor. Our Advisor, with the approval of our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, may engage additional independent valuation advisors in the future as our portfolio grows. At the end of each month, the independent valuation advisor reviews the calculation of our monthly NAV. The independent valuation advisor is not responsible for our NAV, and performs its services based solely on information received from us, our Advisor and our Sub-Advisor. Our Advisor, and not the independent valuation advisor, is ultimately responsible for the determination of our NAV. 
 Our independent valuation advisor may be replaced at any time, in accordance with agreed-upon notice requirements, by a majority vote of our Board, including a majority of our independent directors. We will promptly disclose any changes to the identity or role of the independent valuation advisor in reports we publicly file with the SEC. Our independent valuation advisor discharges its responsibilities in accordance with our valuation guidelines. Our Board is not involved in the monthly valuation of our assets and liabilities, but periodically receives and reviews such information about the valuation of our assets and liabilities as it deems necessary to exercise its oversight responsibility. 
 We have agreed to pay fees to our independent valuation advisor upon its delivery to us of its review reports. We have also agreed to indemnify our independent valuation advisor against certain liabilities arising out of this engagement. The compensation we pay to our independent valuation advisor is not based on the estimated values of our loans or our NAV. 
 Our independent valuation advisor may from time to time in the future perform other commercial real estate and financial advisory services for our Advisor or Sub-Advisor and their affiliates, so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of the independent valuation advisor. 
 Valuation of Investments 
 The majority of our investments consist of CRE debt intended to be held to maturity. We may also invest in real estate and other real estate-related assets and liquid non-real estate-related assets. Real estate-related assets include CRE securities, such as CMBS and CRE CLOs, and unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. Our liquid non-real estate-related assets may include credit rated government and corporate debt securities, publicly traded equity securities and cash and cash equivalents. 
 Our Advisor seeks to determine the fair value of investments as of the last day of each month. Fair value determinations are based upon all available inputs that our Advisor deems relevant, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, discounted cash flow analysis, and valuations prepared by third-party valuation services. However, determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. 
 41 

Mortgage Loans, Participations in Mortgage Loans and Mezzanine Loans . Our Advisor estimates the fair value of our loan portfolio in accordance with the methodologies contained in our valuation guidelines approved by our Board. In general, the loan portfolio will be valued at amortized cost, subject to impairment testing. As of January 1, 2023, we are required under GAAP to record a Current Expected Credit Loss CECL reserve on the CRE debt portfolio that will be adjusted at least quarterly. The analytical portion (which is based on a probability-weighted quantitative analytical model that considers the likelihood of default and loss-given-default for each individual loan) of the CECL reserve is excluded from the value of the loans. The value of the loans does include any specific reserves for collateral-dependent loans included in the CECL reserve amount. We believe this methodology is consistent with institutional valuation practices and provides an appropriate valuation for purposes of establishing a purchase and repurchase price for our shares of common stock as it relates to assets that are intended to be held to maturity. 

Real Estate-Related Securities and Derivatives. Our real estate-related securities investments will generally focus on non-distressed public and private real estate debt, including, but not limited to, CMBS and other forms of debt. Additionally, we may make open market purchases of common stock in public equity REITs. We may also invest in derivatives. Our principal investments in derivative instruments may include investments in interest rate swaps, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements. Our real estate-related securities and derivative investments are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements, in accordance with ASC Topic 820. The valuation of these assets is obtained from market quotations obtained from third-party pricing service providers or broker-dealers. Pursuant to the valuation guidelines adopted by our Board, if market quotations are not readily available (or are otherwise not reliable for a particular investment), the fair value is determined in good faith by our Advisor. Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, estimates of fair value may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed and the differences could be material. Market quotes are considered not readily available in circumstances where there is an absence of current or reliable market-based data (e.g., trade information, bid/ask information, or broker-dealer quotations). Our Board has delegated to our Advisor the responsibility for monitoring significant events that may materially affect the values of our real estate-related securities and derivative investments and for determining whether the value of the applicable investments should be reevaluated in light of such significant events. 

Valuation of Liquid Non-Real Estate-Related Assets . Our liquid non-real estate-related assets are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements, in accordance with ASC Topic 820. The valuation of these assets is based on market prices obtained from third-party pricing services or as published in nationally recognized sources such as Bloomberg. 

Valuation of Properties 
 Wholly Owned Properties . For real properties we own, our Advisor has developed a valuation plan with the objective of having each of our wholly owned properties valued at least annually by an appraisal, except for newly acquired properties as described below, with appraisals scheduled over the course of a year. We rely on property-level information provided by our Advisor, including but not limited to (1) historical and projected operating revenues and expenses of the property, (2) lease agreements with respect to the property and (3) information regarding recent or planned capital expenditures. Appraisals will be performed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of Ethics and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices, the real estate appraisal industry standards created by The Appraisal Foundation. Each appraisal must be reviewed, approved and signed by an individual with the professional designation of MAI (Member of the Appraisal Institute). Newly acquired wholly owned properties will initially be valued at cost and thereafter will join the annual appraisal cycle during the year following the first full calendar year in which we own the property. Development assets, if any, will be valued at cost plus capital expenditures and will join the annual appraisal cycle upon stabilization. Acquisition costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of multiple wholly owned properties that are not directly related to any single wholly owned property generally will be allocated among the applicable wholly owned properties pro rata based on relative values. Properties purchased as a portfolio or held in a joint venture that acquires properties over time may be valued as a single asset. Each individual appraisal report for our assets will be addressed solely to our company to assist in providing our monthly portfolio valuation. 

Our valuation reports will not be addressed to the public and may not be relied upon by any other person to establish an estimated value of our common stock and will not constitute a recommendation to any person to purchase or sell any shares of our common stock. In preparing our NAV calculation, our Advisor will not solicit third-party indications of interest for our common stock in connection with possible purchases thereof or the acquisition of all or any part of our company. Real estate appraisals are reported on a free and clear basis (for example no mortgage), irrespective of any property-level financing that may be in place. The primary methodology used to value properties is the income approach, whereby value is derived by determining the present value of an asset s stream of future cash flows (for example, discounted cash flow analysis). Consistent with industry practices, the income approach incorporates subjective judgments regarding comparable rental and operating expense data, the capitalization or discount rate, and projections of future rent and expenses based on appropriate evidence. 
 42 

Other methodologies that may also be used to value properties include sales comparisons and replacement cost approaches. Because the appraisals involve subjective judgments, the fair value of our assets, which is included in our NAV, may not reflect the liquidation value or net realizable value of our properties. 
 Properties Held Through Joint Ventures . Properties held through joint ventures will be valued in a manner that is consistent with the guidelines described above for wholly owned properties. Once the value of a property held by the joint venture is determined by an independent appraisal, the value of our interest in the joint venture is then determined by applying the distribution provisions of the applicable joint venture agreements to the value of the underlying property held by the joint venture. 

Liabilities 
 We include the fair value of our liabilities as part of our NAV calculation. Our liabilities generally include portfolio-level credit facilities, the fees payable to our Advisor and the Dealer Manager, accounts payable, accrued operating expenses, property-level mortgages, reserves for future liabilities and other liabilities. All liabilities are valued using widely accepted methodologies specific to each type of liability. Our debt is typically valued at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Our aggregate monthly NAV will be reduced to reflect the accrual of the liability to pay any declared (and unpaid) distributions for all classes of common stock. Liabilities allocable to a specific class of shares will only be included in the NAV calculation for that class. 
 NAV and NAV Per Share Calculation 
 Each class of our common stock, including Class P common stock that was not offered to the public, has an undivided interest in our assets and liabilities, other than class-specific liabilities. Our NAV is calculated by the independent valuation advisor for each of these classes. Our Advisor is responsible for reviewing and confirming our NAV, and overseeing the process around the calculation of our NAV, in each case, as calculated by the independent valuation advisor. Because stockholder servicing fees allocable to a specific class of shares will only be included in the NAV calculation for that class, the NAV per share for our share classes may differ. 
 At the end of each month, before taking into consideration class-specific expense accruals for that month, any change in our aggregate NAV (whether an increase or decrease) is allocated among each class of shares based on each class s relative percentage of the previous aggregate NAV plus issuances of shares that were effective on the first business day of such month and issuances of shares under our DRP and less repurchases under our SRP during such month. The NAV calculation is generally available within 15 calendar days after the end of the applicable month. Changes in our monthly NAV include, without limitation, accruals of our net portfolio income, interest expense, the management fee, any accrued performance fee, distributions, unrealized/realized gains and losses on assets, provisions for credit losses recorded on specific loans, any applicable organization and offering costs and any expense reimbursements. Changes in our monthly NAV also include material non-recurring events, such as capital expenditures and material property acquisitions and dispositions occurring during the month. On an ongoing basis, our Advisor will adjust the accruals to reflect actual operating results and the outstanding receivable, payable and other account balances resulting from the accumulation of monthly accruals for which financial information is available. 
 For the purpose of calculating our NAV, offering costs are expenses we incur as we raise proceeds in our public and private offerings. For GAAP purposes, these costs are deducted from equity when incurred. For the NAV calculation, all of the offering costs from our public and private offerings incurred through July 17, 2019 (the NAV Pricing Date were added back to equity and amortized into equity monthly over the 60 months beginning with the first full month that follows the NAV Pricing Date. Following the NAV Pricing Date, offering costs are included in the NAV calculation as and when incurred. 
 Following the aggregation of the NAV of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any other liabilities, the independent valuation advisor will incorporate any class-specific adjustments to our NAV, including additional issuances and repurchases of our common stock and accruals of class-specific stockholder servicing fees. For each applicable class of shares, the stockholder servicing fees will be calculated as a percentage of the aggregate NAV for such class of shares. NAV per share for each class is calculated by dividing such class s NAV at the end of each month by the number of shares outstanding for that class at the end of such month. 
 The combination of the Class A NAV, Class T NAV, Class S NAV, Class D NAV, Class I NAV and Class P NAV equals the value of our assets less our liabilities, which include certain class-specific liabilities. Our Advisor calculates the value of our investments as directed by our valuation guidelines based upon values received from various sources, including independent valuation services. Our Advisor, with assistance from our Sub-Advisor, is responsible for information received from third parties that is used in calculating our NAV. 
 43 

Limits on the Calculation of Our Per Share NAV 
 The overarching principle of our valuation guidelines is to produce reasonable estimated values for each of our investments (and other assets and liabilities). However, the majority of our assets will consist of real estate loans and, as with any real estate valuation protocol and as described above, the valuation of our loans (and other assets and liabilities) will be based on a number of judgments, assumptions and opinions about future events that may or may not prove to be correct. The use of different judgments, assumptions or opinions would likely result in a different estimate of the value of our real estate loans (and other assets and liabilities). Any resulting potential disparity in our NAV per share may be in favor of stockholders whose shares are repurchased, existing stockholders or new purchasers of our common stock, as the case may be, depending on the circumstances at the time (for cases in which our transaction price is based on NAV). 
 Additionally, while the methodologies contained in our valuation guidelines are designed to operate reliably within a wide variety of circumstances, it is possible that in certain unanticipated situations or after the occurrence of certain extraordinary events (such as a significant disruption in relevant markets, a terrorist attack or an act of nature), our ability to calculate NAV may be impaired or delayed, including, without limitation, circumstances where there is a delay in accessing or receiving information from vendors or other reporting agents upon which we may rely upon in determining the monthly value of our NAV. In these circumstances, a more accurate valuation of our NAV could be obtained by using different assumptions or methodologies. Accordingly, in special situations when, in our Advisor s reasonable judgment, the administration of the valuation guidelines would result in a valuation that does not represent a fair and accurate estimate of the value of our investment, alternative methodologies may be applied, provided that our Advisor must notify our Board at the next scheduled board meeting of any alternative methodologies utilized and their impact on the overall valuation of our investment. We include no discounts to our NAV for the illiquid nature of our shares, including the limitations under our SRP and our ability to suspend or terminate our SRP at any time. Our NAV generally does not consider exit costs that would likely be incurred if our assets and liabilities were liquidated or sold. While we may use market pricing concepts to value individual components of our NAV, our per share NAV is not derived from the market pricing information of open-end real estate funds listed on stock exchanges. Our NAV does not represent the fair value of our assets less liabilities under GAAP. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay distributions to our stockholders, fund investments, originate loans, repay borrowings, and other general business needs including the payment of our operating and administrative expenses. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of any future follow-on public offerings of common stock, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include 58.8 million in cash, 247 million in available capacity on our borrowing facilities, and 20 million in available borrowing capacity from our revolving credit letter agreements with IREIC and Sound Point. We may seek additional sources of liquidity from syndicated financing in the form of collateralized loan obligations, sale of loan participations, other borrowings, including additional repurchase agreement facilities and borrowings not related to a specific investment and future offerings of equity and debt securities. 
 Our primary liquidity needs include originating new loans and acquiring assets in accordance with our investment objectives, our commitments to repay the principal and interest on our borrowings and pay other financing costs, financing our assets, making advances on our future funding obligations, making distributions to our stockholders, funding redemptions under our SRP, funding our operations which includes paying fees and expenses to our Advisor and Sub-Advisor, payment of offering costs in connection with public offerings of common stock, and other general business needs.

 Repurchase Agreements and Credit Facilities 
 On February 15, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a master repurchase agreement (the Atlas Repo Facility with Column Financial, Inc. as administrative agent for certain of its affiliates. As our business has grown, we have increased the borrowing limit and extended the maturity. The most recent extension was in November 2023 for a twelve-month term and the maximum advance amount was reduced to 100,000. On February 8, 2023, Column Financial, Inc. and affiliated parties sold and assigned their interest in the Atlas Repo Facility to Atlas Securitized Products Investments 2, L.P. with no changes to the terms of the Atlas Repo Facility. Advances under the Atlas Repo Facility for current loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to SOFR plus 2.50 to 3.00 with a 0.15 to 0.25 floor. We paid off the outstanding balance on the Atlas Repo Facility in May 2023 and had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. As there was no outstanding balance on the Atlas Repo Facility, we were not subject to any financial covenants. 
 On May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association JPM ). The JPM Repo Facility provides up to 150,000 in advances that we expect to use to finance the acquisition or origination of eligible loans and participation interests therein. Advances made prior to December 2021 under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75 to 2.50 with no floor, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. Advances made subsequent to December 2021 under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of SOFR plus an agreed upon margin. As of September 30, 2024, all of the advances made under the JPM Repo Facility were indexed to SOFR and have margins between 1.85 and 2.85 with a floor between 0.00 and 2.00 . In May 2022, the maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility was extended to May 6, 2023. On May 5, 2023, we entered into an amendment that extended the maturity date to May 6, 2026, with the option to extend the maturity date further to May 6, 2028 subject to two optional one-year extensions. The amendment also increased the maximum facility amount to 526,076. We used the increased capacity to pay off the balance on the Atlas Repo Facility. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 On March 10, 2021, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit facility with Western Alliance Bank (the WA Credit Facility, together with the Atlas Repo Facility and the JPM Repo Facility, the Facilities ). The WA Credit Facility provides for loan advances up to the lesser of 75,000 or the borrowing base. The borrowing base consists of eligible assets pledged to and accepted by Western Alliance in its discretion up to the lower of (i) 60 to 70 of loan-to-unpaid balance or (ii) 45 to 50 of the loan-to-appraised value (depending on the property type underlying the asset, for both (i) and (ii)). Assets that would otherwise be eligible become ineligible after being pledged as part of the borrowing base for 36 months. Advances under the WA Credit Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.25 with a floor of 0.75 . The initial maturity date of the WA Credit Facility was March 10, 2023. On March 9, 2023, we extended the maturity date of the WA Credit Facility to March 10, 2025, modified that loan advances are up to the lesser of 40,000 or the borrowing base, and changed the index rate from LIBOR to SOFR. In addition, the spread increased to 3.50 and the floor to 2.50 . We have an option to convert the loan made pursuant to the WA Credit Facility upon its initial maturity to a term loan with the same interest rate and floor and a maturity of two years in exchange for, among other things, a conversion fee of 0.25 of the outstanding amount at the time of conversion. The WA Credit Facility requires maintenance of an average unrestricted aggregate deposit account balance with Western Alliance of not less than 3,750 until the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2023 and not less than 5,000 commencing with the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2023. Failure to meet the minimum deposit balance will result in, among other things, the interest rate of the WA Credit Facility increasing by 0.50 per annum for each quarter in which the compensating balances are not maintained. We paid off the outstanding balance on the WA Credit Facility in May 2024 and had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. As there were no borrowings outstanding, we were not subject to any financial covenants. 
 The Facilities are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.

Loan Participations Sold 
 On November 15, 2021, we sold a non-recourse senior participation interest in nine first mortgage loans to a third party. Under the loan participation agreement, in the event of default by the underlying mortgagor, any amounts paid are first allocated to the third party before any amounts are allocated to our subordinate interest. As the directing participant in the loan participation agreement, we are entitled to exercise, without the consent of the third party, each of the consent approval and control rights under the applicable underlying mortgage loan documents with a few exceptions. We require the third party s approval for any modification or amendment to the loan, a bankruptcy plan for an underlying mortgagor where the third party would incur an out-of-pocket loss, or any transfer of the underlying mortgaged property if our approval is required by the underlying mortgage documents. We remain the directing participant unless certain conditions are met related to losses on the property or if the mortgagor is one of our affiliates. In the former case, we may post cash or short-term U.S. government securities as collateral to retain the rights of the directing participant. 
 The third party, as the senior participation interest holder, receives interest and principal payments from the borrower until they receive the amounts to which they are entitled. All expenses or losses on the underlying mortgages are allocated first to us and then to the third party. If the underlying mortgage is in default, we will have the option to purchase the third party s participation interest and remove it from the loan participation agreement. 
 On July 2, 2024, we acquired legal title to two office properties through non-judicial foreclosure transactions. The underlying loan was subject to the loan participation agreement. Upon foreclosure, we are still subject to the participation payments to the third party. Such payments are based on the underlying properties net income before depreciation adjusted for any non-cash revenue. If the calculated monthly payment exceeds the interest due under the participation agreement, the excess is paid to the third party and recorded as a reduction of past interest due first and then as a reduction of the principal. If the calculated monthly payment is less than the interest due under the participation agreement, the shortfall is accrued as interest payable.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates . 
 Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Loans held-for-investment are anticipated to be held until maturity, and reported at cost, net of allowance for credit losses, any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs, as applicable. In accordance with ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13, we use a probability-weighted quantitative analytical model to estimate and recognize an allowance for credit losses on loans held-for-investment and their related unfunded commitments. We employed quarterly updated macroeconomic forecasts, which reflect expectations for overall economic output, interest rates, values of real estate properties and other factors, geopolitical instability and the Federal Reserve monetary policy impact on the overall U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets generally. These estimates may change in future periods based on available future macroeconomic data and might result in a material change in our future estimates of expected credit losses for our loan portfolio. 
 We consider loan investments that are both (i) expected to be substantially repaid through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral, and (ii) for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, to be collateral-dependent loans. For loans that we determine foreclosure of the collateral is probable, we measure the expected losses based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For collateral-dependent loans that we determine foreclosure is not probable, we apply a practical expedient to estimate expected losses using the difference between the collateral s fair value (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan. 
 For loans assigned a risk rating of 5, we have determined that the recovery of the loan s principal is collateral-dependent. Accordingly, these loans are assessed individually, and we elected to apply a practical expedient in accordance with ASU 2016-13. While utilizing the practical expedient for collateral-dependent loans, we estimate the fair value of the loan s underlying collateral using the discounted cash flow method of valuation, less the estimated cost to foreclose and sell the property when applicable. The estimation of the fair value of the collateral property also involves using various Level 3 unobservable inputs, which are inherently uncertain and subjective, and are in part developed based on discussions with various market participants and management s best estimates, which may vary depending 
 49 

on the information available and market conditions as of the valuation date. Selecting the appropriate inputs and assumptions requires significant judgment and consideration of various factors that are specific to the underlying collateral property being assessed. Our estimate of the fair value of the collateral property is sensitive to both the valuation methodology selected and inputs used in the analysis. As a result, the fair value of the collateral property used in determining the expected credit losses is subject to uncertainty and any actual losses, if incurred, could differ materially from the estimated provision for credit losses. 
 Interest income on loans held-for-investment is recognized at the loan coupon rate. Any premiums or discounts, loan fees, contractual exit fees and origination costs are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the loans using the effective interest method. Generally, loans held-for-investment are placed on nonaccrual status when delinquent for more than 90 days or when determined not to be probable of full collection. Interest income recognition is suspended when loans are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest accrued, but not collected, at the date loans are placed on nonaccrual is reversed and subsequently recognized only to the extent it is received in cash or until it qualifies for return to accrual status. However, when there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, all cash received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Loans held-for-investment are restored to accrual status only when contractually current or the collection of future payments is reasonably assured. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on nonaccrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection or has been modified. 
 The allowance for credit losses is recorded in accordance with ASU 2016-13, and is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans held-for-investment on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are recognized through net income (loss) on our consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss experience, current portfolio, market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration of each respective loan. All loans held-for-investment within our portfolio have some amount of expected loss to reflect the GAAP principal underlying the CECL model that all loans have some inherent risk of loss, regardless of credit quality, subordinate capital or other mitigating factors. 
 Our loans typically include commitments to fund incremental proceeds to our borrowers over the life of the loan. Those future funding commitments are also subject to an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses related to future loan fundings is recorded as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, and not as an offset to the related loan balance. This allowance for credit losses is estimated using the same process outlined below for our outstanding loan balances, and changes in this component of the allowance for credit losses similarly flow through our consolidated statements of operations. 
 The allowance for credit losses is estimated on a quarterly basis and represents management s estimates of current expected credit losses in our investment portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. Estimating an allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective, as it requires management to exercise significant judgment in establishing appropriate factors used to determine the allowance and a variety of subjective assumptions, including (i) determination of relevant historical loan loss data sets, (ii) the expected timing and amount of future loan fundings and repayments, (iii) the current credit quality of loans and operating performance of loan collateral and our expectations of performance, (iv) selecting the forecast for macroeconomic conditions and (v) determining the reasonable and supportable forecast period. 
 We estimate the analytical portion of our allowance for credit losses by using a probability-weighted quantitative analytical model that considers the likelihood of default and loss-given-default for each individual loan. The analytical model incorporates a third-party licensed database for over 100,000 commercial real estate loans. We license certain macroeconomic financial forecasts from a third-party to inform our view of the potential future impact that broader macroeconomic conditions may have on the performance of the loans held-for-investment. These macroeconomic factors include unemployment rates, interest rates, price indices for commercial property and other factors. We may use one or more of these forecasts in the process of estimating our allowance for credit losses. Selection of these economic forecasts requires significant judgment about future events that, while based on the information available to us as of the balance sheet date, are ultimately unknowable with certainty, and the actual economic conditions impacting our portfolio could vary significantly from the estimates we made for the periods presented. Significant inputs to our estimate of the allowance for credit losses include the reasonable and supportable forecast period and loan specific factors such as debt service coverage ratio, or DSCR, loan-to-value ratio, or LTV, remaining contractual loan term, property type and others. In addition, we also consider relevant loan-specific qualitative factors to estimate our allowance for credit losses. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that were reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources excluding future loan advance commitments as disclosed in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Credit Risk 
 Our investments are subject to a high degree of credit risk. Credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults. Default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, borrower financial condition, property performance, property management, supply/demand factors, construction trends, consumer behavior, regional economics, interest rates, the strength of the U.S. economy, and other factors beyond our control. All loans are subject to some risk of default. We manage credit risk through the underwriting process and investment structuring process, acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value, if any, and establishing loss assumptions. We also carefully monitor the performance of the loans, as well as external factors that may affect their value. 
 Adverse economic conditions could negatively impact the commercial properties underlying our investments resulting in potential borrower delinquencies or defaults. If we fail to repay the lender at maturity, the lender has the right to immediately sell the collateral and pursue us for any shortfall if the sales proceeds are inadequate to cover the repurchase agreement financing. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we may borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. We do not hold or issue derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign denominated investments, and thus, we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our debt investment portfolio was 98 variable rate investments based on SOFR for various terms. Borrowings under our master repurchase agreements were short-term and at a variable rate. Both our investment portfolio and borrowings have minimum levels for SOFR known as interest rate floors. The floors were established when the loans and borrowings were originated based on market conditions. The following table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should interest rates increase or decrease by 25 or 50 basis points, assuming that our current balance sheet was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity. The change from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the changes in the portfolio relating to payoffs, paydowns and draws.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
 On September 12, 2024, we issued a total of 1,812 shares of restricted stock to our independent directors for their service as such. The issuance of these securities was effected without registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a sale by the Company not involving a public offering. No underwriters were involved with the issuance of such securities. 
 Use of Proceeds 
 On May 3, 2019, our 2019 Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-230465) for our IPO of common stock of up to 2,350,000 in shares of Class A, Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I common stock, was declared effective under the Securities Act. Inland Securities Corporation served as our dealer manager for the common stock IPO. On April 28, 2022, we filed 2022 Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-264540) with the SEC, for our Second Public Offering, to register up to 2,200,000 in shares of common stock, which was declared effective by the SEC on November 2, 2022.

We primarily used the net offering proceeds from the Public Offerings to originate commercial real estate loans and purchase real estate securities on a levered basis, subject to our investment guidelines and to the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification, and other general corporate purposes. 
 In light of the pace of fundraising in the Second Public Offering and the amount of monthly redemption requests pursuant to the SRP, which were in excess of such fundraising, on January 30, 2023, the Board approved, effective immediately, the suspension of the operation of the SRP. In connection with such suspension, the Board also approved the suspension of the sale of shares in the primary portion of the Second Public Offering (the Primary Offering ), effective immediately, and the suspension of the sale of shares pursuant to the DRP, effective as of February 10, 2023. The Primary Offering, the SRP, and the DRP shall each remain suspended unless and until such time as the Board approves their resumption. 
 On September 15, 2021, our registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-258802) for our Preferred Stock Offering of up to 3,500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock was declared effective under the Securities Act. Raymond James Associates acted as representative of the underwriters. On September 22, 2021, we issued and sold 3,500,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a public offering price of 25.00 per share. In addition, on October 15, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol ICR PR A. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we received net offering proceeds of 86.3 million from our Preferred Stock Offering. The following table summarizes certain information about the proceeds from our Preferred Stock Offering in thousands):

We contributed the net proceeds from the Preferred Stock Offering to our Operating Partnership, which in turn used the net proceeds to originate first mortgage loans and acquire other targeted assets in a manner consistent with our investment strategies and investment guidelines and for general corporate purposes. 
 Repurchases of Common Stock 
 We adopted an SRP, effective May 3, 2019, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders who have held our shares of common stock for at least one year may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests. Because there is no public market for our shares, stockholders 
 53 

may have difficulty selling their shares if we choose to repurchase only some, or even none, of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased in any particular month, in our discretion, or if our Board modifies, suspends or terminates the SRP. 
 In addition, we established limitations on the amount of funds we may use for repurchases during any calendar month and quarter. We may repurchase fewer shares than have been requested in any particular month to be repurchased under our SRP, or none at all, in our discretion at any time. In addition, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares will be limited to no more than 2 of our aggregate NAV per month and no more than 5 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter. 
 In light of the pace of fundraising in the Second Public Offering and the amount of monthly redemption requests pursuant to the SRP, which were in excess of such fundraising, on January 30, 2023, our Board unanimously approved, effective immediately, the suspension of the operation of the SRP. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased no shares of our common stock. 
 Repurchases of Series A Preferred Stock 
 Subject to certain exceptions, we may not redeem our Series A Preferred Stock until on or after September 22, 2026. Preferred stockholders may only convert their Series A Preferred Shares into Class I common stock if there is a Change of Control and we do not redeem the shares within 120 days of the Change of Control event. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no redemptions of our Series A Preferred Stock and no conversions of our Series A Preferred Stock to common stock. 
 On August 11, 2022, the Board authorized and approved a share repurchase program (the Series A Preferred Repurchase Program pursuant to which we were permitted to repurchase up to the lesser of 1,000,000 shares or 15 million of the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock through December 31, 2022. On November 10, 2022, the Board approved to extend the Series A Preferred Repurchase Program through December 31, 2023. Under the Series A Preferred Repurchase Program, repurchases of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock were to be made at management s discretion from time to time through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. On January 30, 2023, our Board approved the termination of the Series A Preferred Repurchase Program.
