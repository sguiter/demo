CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "continues," "feels," "forecasts," or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as "will," "should," "could," "may," "aims," "intends," or "projects." Statements may be forward looking even in the absence of these particular words. 
 
 Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our financial position, business strategy, and other plans and objectives for our future operations, and generation of free cash flow. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. The forward-looking statements contained herein are largely based on our expectations for the future, which reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions, operating trends, and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As such, management s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. 
 
 We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained herein are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be realized or that the events and circumstances they describe will occur. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, including access to premium products, volume discounts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or the ability to cancel orders or return merchandise; inventory management; our ability to fund our planned capital investments; execution of the Company's long-term strategic plan; a recession, volatility in the financial markets, and other global economic factors, including inflation; capital and resource allocation among our strategic opportunities; our ability to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases; cash management; liquidity; cash flow from operations; access to credit markets at competitive terms; borrowing capacity under our credit facility; cash repatriation; supply chain issues; labor shortages and wage pressures; consumer spending levels and expectations; licensed store arrangements; the effect of certain governmental assistance programs; the success of our marketing and sponsorship arrangements; expectations regarding increasing global taxes and tariffs; the effect of increased government regulation, compliance, and changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation or government investigation that affects us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; ESG risks; increased competition; geopolitical events; the financial effects of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; counterparty risks; and any other factors set forth in the section entitled "Risk Factors" of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance. 
 
 Please refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and any investment in our securities. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this report, or any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 , we recorded million of impairment on the atmos tradename following a strategic review of the atmos business, million of reorganization costs primarily related to the announced closure and relocation of our global headquarters and the shutdown of our operations in South Korea, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and million of impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets primarily related to accelerated tenancy charges on right-of-use assets for the closures in South Korea, New York headquarters, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. We will close all stores operating in South Korea, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden as we focus on improving the overall results of our international operations. For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 , we recorded an additional million of impairment of long-lived and right-of-use assets related to our decision to exit the underperforming operations and the closure and sublease of an unprofitable store in Europe, as well as a million loss accrual for legal claims.

We evaluate our minority investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable and an impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. We estimate the fair value of our minority investments using a discounted cash flow approach, which considers forecasted cash flows provided by the investee's management, as well as assumptions over discount rates and terminal values. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the investment downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values. For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 , we recorded a million non-cash impairment charge related to a minority investment that is accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative. 

Restricted cash included in other current assets 
 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets

Amounts included in restricted cash primarily relate to amounts held in escrow in connection with various leasing arrangements in Europe.

million secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The amendment provides for, among other things, (i) an uncommitted "accordion" feature that allows us, subject to certain customary conditions, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility to up to million in the aggregate, (ii) an extension of the maturity date from July 14, 2025 to June 20, 2029, and (iii) a change to the interest rates and commitment fees applicable to the loans and commitments, respectively, as described below. The amendment provides that the interest rate applicable to loans drawn under the credit facility will be equal to, at our option, either a base rate, determined by reference to the federal funds rate, plus a margin of to per annum, or a forward-looking term rate, determined by reference to Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of to per annum, in each case, depending on availability under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we will pay a commitment fee from to per annum on the unused portion of the commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. No events of default occurred during 2024. 
 
 Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on certain assets, including inventory and accounts receivable, cash deposits, and certain insurance proceeds. We may use the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, support standby letters of credit in connection with insurance programs. We did not have any borrowings outstanding as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 . The letters of credit outstanding as of November 2, 2024 were million. 
 
 We paid fees of million in connection with the amendment of our credit facility and such costs are amortized over the life of the extended facility. The unamortized balance as of November 2, 2024 was million, which included the unamortized costs of the prior agreement.

There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets and liabilities for any of the periods presented. 
 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These assets are measured using Level 3 inputs, if determined to be impaired. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded million of impairment on the atmos tradename following a strategic review of the atmos business. We calculated the fair value using a discounted cash flow method, based on the relief from royalty method, which uses estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates in the category of intellectual property, discount rates, and other variables. 
 
 We have a minority investment that is accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a million non-cash impairment charge related to our investment, thereby reducing the carrying value to million due to an evaluation of events that indicated that the carrying value of the investment was impaired. We estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach, which considered forecasted cash flows provided by the investee's management, as well as assumptions over discount rates, and terminal values. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024 , cumulative impairments on our portfolio of minority investments were million. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were as follows: 

Fair value 

1 The carrying value of debt as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , included and 5 million, respectively, of issuer s discount and costs. 

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, and other current receivables and payables approximate their fair value. 

The computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows: 
 Weighted-average common shares outstanding 
 Dilutive effect of potential common shares 
 Weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution 
 
 (Loss) earnings per share - basic 
 (Loss) earnings per share - diluted 
 
 Anti-dilutive share-based awards excluded from diluted calculation 

Performance stock units related to our long-term incentive programs of million and million have been excluded from diluted weighted-average shares for the periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , respectively. The issuance of these shares is contingent on our performance metrics as compared to the pre-established performance goals, which have not been achieved.

The total fair value of options vested for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The cash received from option exercises and the related tax were not significant for any of the periods presented. The total intrinsic value of options exercised, outstanding, and outstanding and exercisable was not significant for any of the periods presented. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of years. 
 
 The table below summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at November 2, 2024 .

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 Foot Locker, Inc. is a leading footwear and apparel retailer that unlocks the "inner sneakerhead" in all of us. We have a strong history of sneaker authority that sparks discovery and ignites the power of sneaker culture through our portfolio of brands, including Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and atmos. 
 
 Ensuring that our customers can engage with us in the most convenient manner for them whether in our stores, on our websites, or on our mobile applications, is a high priority for us. We use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners. These sites offer our largest product selections and provide a seamless link between our e-commerce experience and physical stores. In the second quarter, we enhanced our loyalty FLX Rewards Program across North America, with plans to expand to other geographies. The FLX Rewards program introduced FLX Cash, enabling customers to use points towards a discount on purchases, and other member-exclusive benefits, including priority access to highly anticipated sneaker launches, exclusive sales, member-only events, free returns, upgraded birthday gifts, and continued complimentary shipping for members. We believe that our FLX Rewards Program is key to driving customer retention and engagement. 
 
 As part of our annual strategic review of operations, management initiated various actions to improve profitability in targeted areas of the business. We recently announced our decision to exit underperforming operations in South Korea, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. We plan to close all stores operating in those regions by mid-2025. In addition, we entered into agreements to sell our Greece and Romania businesses, and entered into license arrangements with the purchaser for the rights to operate Foot Locker stores in Greece and Romania, as well as six other countries in South East Europe. The sale transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2025. We do not believe the sale will be significant to our financial results. To further support strategic progress against the Lace Up Plan, we have also announced that we will move our global headquarters to St. Petersburg, Florida in late 2025. The intent of the relocation is to further build on our meaningful presence in St. Petersburg and to enable increased collaboration among teams across banners and functions, while also reducing costs. During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded impairment and reorganization charges of 13 million in connection with these decisions. 

Store Count 
 
 At November 2, 2024, we operated 2,450 stores as compared with 2,523 and 2,607 stores at February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Licensed Operations 
 
 A total of 214 licensed stores were operating at November 2, 2024, as compared with 202 and 190 stores at February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively, operating in the Middle East and Asia. These stores are not included in the operating store count above. During the third quarter of 2024, our license partners opened the first Foot Locker store and digital platform in India. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 We evaluate performance based on several factors, primarily the banner s financial results, referred to as division profit. Division profit reflects income before income taxes, impairment and other charges, corporate expenses, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

 Corporate expense consists of unallocated selling, general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Company s corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items.

 Other (expense) income, net includes non-operating items, changes in fair value of minority interests measured at fair value or using the fair value measurement alternative, changes in the market value of our available-for-sale security, our share of earnings or losses related to our equity method investments, and net benefit expense related to our pension and postretirement programs excluding the service cost component. See the Other (expense) income, net section for further information. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
 
 We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements. 
 
 These non-GAAP measures are presented because we believe they assist investors in allowing a more direct comparison of our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives. We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition, and not as an alternative, to our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP pre-tax (loss) income.

Segment Reporting and Results of Operations 
 
 We have determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Kids Foot Locker, and WSS, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of the Foot Locker banner and its related e-commerce business operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as atmos, which operates in Japan. We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics. 
 
 Sales 
 
 All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also includes our direct-to-customers channel. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. In fiscal years following those with 53 weeks, including 2024, we calculate comparable sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior-year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.

For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, total sales decreased by 28 million, or 1.4 , to 1,958 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, total sales decreased by 46 million, or 0.8 , to 5,728 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased by 2.2 and 0.7 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, respectively. Sales increased by 15 million and declined by 4 million for the thirteen weeks ended and the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from foreign currency fluctuations related primarily to the Euro and British Pound. In connection with the second quarter launch of the FLX Reward Program, we recorded a reduction in sales of 11 million, based on the change in estimated value of the loyalty program liability. Comparable sales for the combined channels increased by 2.4 and 1.0 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods.

Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q Page 19

As previously announced, we are repositioning the Champs Sports banner, which resulted in expected total sales and comparable sales declines due to the transition. We believe that the Champs Sports repositioning will be completed by the end of the current fiscal year with approximately 10-20 additional planned store closures in the fourth quarter, which is not expected to be significant. During the second quarter, we launched our new Champs Sports brand campaign, garnering positive results and improved comparable sales trends. This new brand platform, "Sport For Life" is a celebration of the powerful connection between sports and everyday life serving the sports-style enthusiast. The momentum generated by this campaign, as well as improved product offerings generated a 2.8 comparable sales growth in the third quarter. 
 
 For both the quarter and year-to-date periods, sales excluding foreign currency fluctuations for the combined channels decreased in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by an increase in EMEA. Total North America sales were negatively affected by our strategic decision to close stores in our Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and Champs Sports banners, as 150 fewer stores were operating compared with the prior-year period, however our stores operating in North America generated comparable sales growth. Additionally, the decrease in total sales was partially offset by an increase in sales from our WSS banner, which benefited from new store growth, as they operated 19 additional stores period-over-period. Constant currency sales for EMEA increased, reflecting improved product assortments coupled with a positive response to our back-to-school sale period in a continued highly promotional marketplace, partially offset by the loss of sales from the Sidestep banner, which closed in the second quarter of 2023 resulting in a decrease of 26 million for the year-to-date period. Asia Pacific's sales, excluding foreign currency fluctuations, decreased primarily as a result of the prior-year closures of our operations in Hong Kong and Macau and the sale of our Singapore and Malaysia operations to our licensing partner in the second quarter of 2023. These businesses represented a decline in sales of 31 million for the year-to-date period. Additionally, sales decreased from our operations in Australia and New Zealand due to macroeconomic headwinds and a highly competitive marketplace. The decline in sales from our atmos banner of 7 million and 17 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, was primarily due to our decision to accelerate shifts to our own digital site and away from less profitable third-party digital platforms, in addition to the closing of our U.S. atmos operations at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, which represented a decline in sales of 3 million and 8 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. 
 
 From a product perspective for the combined channels, comparable sales increased in the footwear and accessories categories, partially offset by a decline in the apparel category in the quarter and year-to-date periods. The overall increase was driven by exciting products from our array of strategic and emerging brand partners.

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities. 
 
 The gross margin rate increased to 29.6 for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 230 basis point increase in the merchandise margin rate. For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, gross margin rate increased to 28.7 as compared with the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 30 basis point increase in the merchandise margin rate, and a 30 basis point leverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate. The year-to-date gross margin rate was pressured by 10 basis points from the loyalty program reduction in sales, reflecting the redesign that was launched in the second quarter. Excluding the effect of the reduction in sales related to loyalty program redesign, merchandise margin rate improved in the quarter and year-to-date periods as we were less promotional this year as compared with last year. The leverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate was primarily related to rent renegotiations and our ongoing optimization of our store portfolio.

As a percentage of sales, SG A increased by 210 basis points and 200 basis points for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, respectively, primarily due to investments in technology and brand-building as well as higher inflation, partially offset by savings from the cost optimization program, store closures, and ongoing expense discipline. The third quarter year-to-date period reflected higher incentive compensation as compared with corresponding prior-year period due to higher forecasted achievement of targeted performance.

 Impairment and Other 
 
 During the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, we recorded 25 million of impairment on the atmos tradename following a strategic review of the atmos business, 7 million of reorganization costs primarily related to the announced closure and relocation of our global headquarters and the shutdown of our operations in South Korea, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and 6 million of impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets primarily related to accelerated tenancy charges on right-of-use assets for the closures in South Korea, New York headquarters, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we recorded an additional 16 million of impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets related to our decision to exit the underperforming operations and the closure and sublease of an unprofitable store in Europe, as well as a 7 million loss accrual for legal claims. 
 
 For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, we incurred 1 million and 27 million of transformation consulting expense, respectively. For the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, we recorded a 3 million net benefit from the settlement of lease obligations associated with Sidestep stores, partially offset by impairment on atmos U.S. assets of 1 million. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, we recorded impairment expense of 19 million primarily driven by accelerated tenancy charges on right-of-use assets for the closures of the Sidestep banner and Foot Locker Asia stores. Additionally, we recorded reorganization costs of 7 million and 12 million, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, respectively, related to the announced closure of the Sidestep banner, Foot Locker Asia stores, and a North American distribution center,

This caption includes non-operating items, including changes in fair value of minority investments measured at fair value or using the fair value measurement alternative, changes in the market value of our available-for-sale security, our share of earnings or losses related to our equity method investments, and net benefit / (expense) related to our pension and postretirement programs excluding the service cost component. 
 
 For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, we recorded a 35 million non-cash impairment charge related to a minority investment that is accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative, which is cost, adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment under the practicability exception. We assess the carrying value of this investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and consider factors including, but not limited to, expected cash flows, underperformance relative to its plans and continued losses of the investee. We estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach, which considered forecasted cash flows provided by the investee's management, as well as assumptions over discount rates and terminal values. Additionally, the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 other (expense) income, net reflected expense of 2 million and 5 million, respectively, related to our pension and postretirement programs. In addition, we recorded a 2 million loss on our equity method investments for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024. 
 
 The thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023 reflected a gain of 2 million from the resolution of working capital related to the sale of our Foot Locker Singapore and Malaysia businesses to our license partner in the second quarter and a 3 million gain on the sale of a corporate office property in North America. This was partially offset by expense of 2 million related to our pension and postretirement programs. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, other income / (expense), net included an additional 4 million of expense related to our pension and postretirement programs and an additional 2 million gain from the previously mentioned business divestiture.

41.1 

Our current year interim provision for income taxes was measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate, which represented a blend of federal, state, and foreign taxes and included the effect of certain nondeductible items as well as changes in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings or losses, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented. 
 
 We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, we may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation. During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , we recognized tax benefits of 2 million and 4 million, respectively, from reserve releases due to various statute of limitations expirations on our foreign income taxes. 
 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 , we recorded 2 million of expense related to tax deficiencies from share-based compensation, primarily from the vesting of certain grants. The amount recorded in the corresponding prior-year period was not significant. 

Excluding these items, the effective tax rates for the current year periods were unfavorable, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods, primarily due to a loss before tax with non-deductible expenses remaining relatively unchanged, coupled with a change in geographic mix of earnings. 

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two guidelines published to date include transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax of 15 . Based on current enacted legislation effective in 2024 and our structure, the effect of these rules was not significant to our overall effective tax rates for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 , and we do not currently expect a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate for 2024. We are monitoring developments and evaluating the effects that these new rules will have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these requirements. 
 
 The Company may also repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Share repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic considerations, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of November 2, 2024, approximately 1.1 billion remained available under our current 1.2 billion share repurchase program. 

Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q Page 23

Table of Contents 

Our expected full-year capital spending is 270 million and an additional 50 million is expected related to software-as-a-service implementation costs, totaling spend of 320 million. The forecast includes 185 million related to the updating ("refresh"), remodeling or relocation of stores, as well as new stores. Updating our stores or "refreshes" represent spending directed towards elevating our brand experience, with modest capital expenditures per store. Additionally, we expect to spend 85 million primarily for our technology and supply chain initiatives, including capital expenditures related to two new distribution centers. We also expect to spend an additional 50 million in software-as-a-service implementation costs, related to our technology initiatives as we modernize our enterprise resource planning tools including e-commerce, supply chain, and finance. We hav e the ability to revise and reschedule some of the anticipated spending program related to our stores should our financial position require it. 
 
 Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix, retail locations and websites, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, as well as other factors listed under the headings "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," and "Risk Factors" could affect our ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

Operating activities reflects net (loss) income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net (loss) income for non-cash items include impairment charges, other charges, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense. 
 
 The increase in cash from operating activities primarily reflected working capital improvemen ts, partially offset by a loss in the current period as compared with income in the corresponding prior-year period. Timing on accounts payable and other accruals contributed 187 million, reflecting reductions in incentive compensation and income tax payments.

The change in investing activities primarily reflected higher capital expenditures in the current period. Additionally, the prior-year period included 16 million of proceeds from the sale of busin
 esses and 
 6
 million of proceeds from the sale of property. For the 
 thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, capital expenditures increased by 
 20 million to 
 185 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Our current year capital plans call for the remodeling or relocation 
 of approximately 490 existing stores, 
 of which approximately 420 stores represent refreshes or updates to our current design standards. During the 
 thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we remodeled or relocated 
 297 stores, including the refresh of 
 247 stores.

The change in financing activities primarily resulted from not paying dividends during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, as compared with 113 million in dividends paid in the corresponding prior-year period. Also contributing to the decline was a 5 million reduction in repurchases of common stock related to share-based tax withholdings, partially offset by 4 million in debt issuance costs related to our amendment of our credit facility. During the second quarter of 2024, we amended our 600 million revolving credit facility, which provided for (i) an uncommitted "accordion" feature that allows us, subject to certain customary conditions, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility to up to 750 million in the aggregate, (ii) an extension of the maturity date from July 14, 2025 to June 20, 2029, and (iii) a change to the interest rates and commitment fees applicable to the loans and commitments, among other items. 
 
 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure) 
 
 In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.
