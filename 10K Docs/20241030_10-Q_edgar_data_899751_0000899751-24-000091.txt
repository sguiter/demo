For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of million and million, respectively. The Company's effective income tax rate was ) and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the rate was negatively impacted by non-deductible interest expense in the United States, foreign branch income related to the Carlstar acquisition, and one-time impacts associated with transaction costs, which were also not fully deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally the rate was impacted by the results of foreign income tax rate differential on the mix of earnings, non-deductible royalty expenses in certain jurisdictions, and certain foreign inclusion items on the domestic provision. 
 
 The Company s 2023 income tax expense and rate differed from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pre-tax income primarily as a result of foreign income tax rate differential on the mix of earnings, non-deductible royalty expenses in certain jurisdictions, the valuation allowance on the interest expense carryforward, and certain foreign inclusion items on the domestic provision. 
 
 The Company continues to monitor the realization of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. The Company analyzes available positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is needed based on the weight of the evidence. This objectively verifiable evidence primarily includes the past ' profit and loss positions. This process requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that are uncertain in nature. The Company has established valuation allowances with respect to certain deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and continues to monitor and assess the need for valuation allowances in all its jurisdictions.

 customer markets: agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer. These segments are based on the information used by the chief executive officer to make certain operating decisions, allocate portions of capital expenditures and assess segment performance. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment external revenues, expenses, and income from operations are determined on the basis of the results of operations of operating units of manufacturing facilities. Segment assets are generally determined on the basis of an allocation of the tangible assets located at such operating units manufacturing facilities and the intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of such operating units. However, certain operating units property, plant, and equipment balances are carried at the corporate level. 
 
 Titan is organized primarily on the basis of products being included in marketing segments, with each reportable segment including wheels, tires, wheel/tire assemblies, and undercarriage systems and components. Given the integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations primarily based on segment sales data must be made to determine operating segment data.

OVERVIEW 
 Titan International, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a global wheel, tire, and undercarriage industrial manufacturer and supplier that services customers across the globe. As a leading manufacturer in the off-highway industry, Titan produces a broad range of products to meet the specifications of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and aftermarket customers in the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer markets. Titan manufactures and sells certain tires under the Goodyear Farm Tire, Titan Tire, Carlstar and Voltyre-Prom Tire brands and has complete research and development facilities to validate tire and wheel designs. Carlstar sells tire products under the Carlisle brand under a long-term license agreement and also sells tires under other recognized brand names, including ITP , Trail Wolf , Links , USA Trail and Carlisle Radial Trail HD highway trailer tires. 
 
 Agricultural Segment: Titan s agricultural wheels, tires, and components are manufactured for use on various agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, skidders, plows, planters, and irrigation equipment, and are sold directly to OEMs and to the aftermarket through independent distributors, equipment dealers, and Titan s distribution centers. The wheels range in diameter from nine inches to 54 inches, with the 54-inch diameter being the largest agricultural wheel manufactured in North America. Basic configurations are combined with distinct variations (such as different centers and a wide range of material thickness) allowing the Company to offer a broad line of products to meet customer specifications. Titan s agricultural tires range from approximately one foot to approximately seven feet in outside diameter and from five inches to 55 inches in width. Agricultural tires are offered under the Goodyear Farm Tire, Titan Tire, Carlstar and Voltyre-Prom brands with a full portfolio of sizes, load carrying capabilities, and tread patterns necessary for the markets served. The Company offers the added value of delivering a complete wheel and tire assembly to OEM and aftermarket customers. 
 
 Earthmoving/Construction Segment: The Company manufactures wheels, tires, and undercarriage systems and components for various types of OTR earthmoving, mining, military, construction, and forestry equipment, including skid steers, aerial lifts, cranes, graders and levelers, scrapers, self-propelled shovel loaders, articulated dump trucks, load transporters, haul trucks, backhoe loaders, crawler tractors, lattice cranes, shovels, and hydraulic excavators. The Company provides OEM and aftermarket customers with a broad range of earthmoving/construction wheels ranging in diameter from 15 to 63 inches and in weight from 125 pounds to 7,000 pounds. The 63-inch diameter wheel is the largest manufactured for the global earthmoving/construction market. Titan s earthmoving/construction tires are offered in the Titan brand and range from approximately three feet to approximately 13 feet in outside diameter and in weight from 50 pounds to 12,500 pounds. Earthmoving/construction tires offered by Titan serve virtually every off-road application in the industry with some of the highest load requirements in the most severe applications. The Company also offers the added value of wheel and tire assembly for certain applications in the earthmoving/construction segment. 
 
 Consumer Segment: In February 2024, Titan acquired Carlstar, which is a global manufacturer and distributor of wheels and tires for a variety of end-market verticals including outdoor power equipment, power sports, and high speed trailers. Carlstar is primarily concentrated in the consumer segment, but also manufactures and sells small to midsize agricultural tires. 
 
 Titan manufactures bias truck tires in Latin America and light truck tires in Russia. Titan also offers select products for ATVs, side-by-sides, rock climbers, and turf, and has recently expanded its offering into the lawn and garden segment with a major OE customer. This segment also includes sales that do not readily fall into the Company's other segments, such as custom rubber stock mixing sales to a variety of OEMs in tangential industries. 
 
 The Company s top customers, including global leaders in agricultural and construction equipment manufacturing, have been purchasing products from Titan or its predecessors for numerous years. Customers including AGCO Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., CNH Global N.V., Deere Company, Hitachi, Ltd., Kubota Corporation, Liebherr, and Volvo have helped sustain Titan s market leading position in wheel, tire, assembly, and undercarriage products.

 MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 
 AGRICULTURAL MARKET OUTLOOK 
 During recent months, agriculture-related commodity prices have declined from historical highs and farmer income has experienced reduced levels. However, population growth, a shift in consumer preference towards higher protein diets, and the replacement of an aging large equipment fleet in favor of newer and higher productivity technology, have created market conditions which are anticipated to support continued demand for the Company's products in the mid- to long-term time horizon. The agricultural market is currently experiencing a significant slowdown in customer demand, but the underlying market conditions mentioned previously are expected to provide future support for the mid- to long-term demand for the Company's products. Many more variables, including weather, volatility in the price of commodities, grain prices, export markets, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, government policies, subsidies, and the demand for used equipment, can greatly affect the Company's performance in the agricultural market in a given period. 
 
 EARTHMOVING/CONSTRUCTION MARKET OUTLOOK 
 The earthmoving/construction segment is affected by many variables, including commodity prices, road construction, infrastructure, government appropriations, housing starts, and other macroeconomic drivers. The construction market is primarily driven by country-specific GDP and the need for infrastructure developments. The earthmoving/construction markets are currently experiencing a slowdown in OEM demand, but we expect the market to stabilize over the mid to long term given the level of mining capital budgets and forecasted GDP growth. Mineral commodity prices are at relatively high levels, which also supports the forecasted mid- to long-term growth. 
 
 CONSUMER MARKET OUTLOOK 
 The consumer market consists of several distinct product lines within different regions. These products include specialty tires and products under the Carlstar brands within powersports, outdoor power equipment and high-speed trailers. The consumer market also includes light truck tires and other specialty products, including custom mixing of rubber stock, and train brakes. Some aspects of the consumer market are experiencing a significant slowdown, particularly in the Americas. The consumer segment pace of growth can vary from period to period and is affected by many variables including inflationary impacts, consumer spending, interest rates, government policies, and other macroeconomic drivers.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 448.0 million, compared to 401.8 million in the comparable period of 2023. This growth was primarily driven by higher volumes in the consumer segment, bolstered by the net sales contribution from the Carlstar acquisition completed on February 29, 2024. The sales increase was partially offset by reduced sales in the agricultural and earthmoving/construction segments, stemming from weakened global end customer demand. Furthermore, the net sales increase was impacted by negative price effects primarily due to reductions in steel and energy costs

 and an unfavorable currency translation impact of 3.3 . 
 
 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,462.4 million, compared to 1,431.6 million in the comparable period of 2023. Net sales increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes, resulting from the positive contribution from the Carlstar acquisition. The increase was partially offset by lower demand for agriculture and construction equipment, the adverse impact of price, as well as a 3.1 unfavorable foreign currency translation effect. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 58.8 million, or 13.1 of net sales, compared to 66.1 million, or 16.4 of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in gross profit and margin were attributed to negative price/mix, reduced fixed cost leverage, a slight increase in material costs, and an inventory revaluation step-up of 0.8 million related to the purchase price allocation for Carlstar. Excluding the inventory revaluation step-up, adjusted gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 13.3 of net sales. 
 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 216.6 million, or 14.8 of net sales, compared to 247.5 million, or 17.3 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in gross profit and gross margin for nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period were primarily due to reduced fixed cost leverage, higher material costs and inventory revaluation step-up of 11.5 million associated with the Carlstar purchase price allocation. Excluding the inventory revaluation step-up, adjusted gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 15.6 of net sales. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 49.5 million, or 11.1 of net sales, compared to 33.6 million, or 8.4 of net sales, three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in SG A for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to the ongoing SG A associated with the Carlstar operations, specifically related to the management of distribution centers. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 140.5 million, or 9.6 of net sales, compared to 102.9 million, or 7.2 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the continuing SG A incurred on the Carlstar operations, which includes the management of distribution centers, and general inflationary cost impacts, such as rising personnel-related expenses. 
 
 Acquisition Related Expenses 
 Acquisition related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.2 million, associated with the one-time transaction costs for Carlstar. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development (R D) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.2 million, or 0.9 of net sales, compared to 3.2 million, or 0.8 of net sales, for the comparable period in 2023. R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 12.1 million, or 0.8 of net sales, compared to 9.4 million, or 0.7 of net sales, for the comparable period in 2023. R D spending reflects initiatives to improve product designs and an ongoing focus on innovation and quality. 
 
 Royalty Expense 
 The Company has trademark license agreements with The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company to manufacture and sell certain farm tires under the Goodyear name, currently scheduled to expire in 2025. These agreements cover sales in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. The Company also has a trademark license agreement with Carlisle Companies, Inc. to manufacture and sell certain tires under the Carlisle brand. Royalty expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.3 million, or 0.5 of net sales, compared to 2.3 million, or 0.6 of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Royalty expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.6 million, or 0.5 of net sales, compared to 7.2 million, or 0.5 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Income from Operations 
 Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million, compared to income from operations of 27.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 50.2 million, compared to income from operations of 128.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in income from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to lower gross profit and the net result of the items previously discussed. 
 
 OTHER PROFIT/LOSS ITEMS 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 9.0 million and 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 27.1 million and 22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a new domestic credit facility, which became effective on February 29, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Carlstar. This resulted in additional interest expenses being recorded during this period. The higher interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also primarily driven by the new domestic credit facility. These changes in interest expenses reflected the Company's strategic financial decisions and its ongoing efforts to optimize its capital structure and financing activities. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 3.1 million and 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 8.5 million and 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decline in interest income for the three-month period was primarily due to financial investments in Argentina and the United States, while the increase for the nine-month period was mainly driven by financial investments in Brazil. 
 
 Foreign Exchange (Loss) Gain 
 Foreign exchange loss was 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in foreign exchange (loss) gain during the three months ended on September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was attributable to the unfavorable impact of the translation of intercompany loans at certain foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in local currencies rather than the reporting currency, which is the United States dollar. Since these intercompany loans are expected to be settled at some point in the future, the loans are adjusted each reporting period to reflect the current exchange rates. 
 
 Foreign exchange loss was 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in foreign exchange loss during the nine months ended on September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was attributable to the unfavorable impact of the movement of exchange rates in certain geographies in which we conduct business, particularly in Argentina and Turkey (refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 
 Other Income 
 Other income was 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income of 0.5 million in the comparable period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 1.0 million loss on the sale of an Indian undercarriage business, which was partially offset by a 0.5 million gain from insurance proceeds related to equipment at our North American wheel facility, along with an increase of 0.4 million in other miscellaneous income. 
 
 Other income was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income of 2.4 million in the comparable period of 2023. This growth was mainly driven by a 1.9 million gain from a property insurance settlement, reflecting net insurance proceeds received after costs incurred to repair one of our operating facilities in Italy, along with an additional 0.5 million from equipment at our North American wheel facility. This increase was partially offset by the aforementioned loss on the sale of the Indian undercarriage business. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 12.9 million and 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of 38.1 million and 28.4 million, respectively. The Company's effective income tax rate was (244.4) and 19.4 for the three

 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 114.4 and 25.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the income tax expense differed each period due to an overall decrease in pre-tax income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the rate was negatively impacted by non-deductible interest expense in the United States, foreign branch income related to the Carlstar acquisition, and one-time impacts associated with transaction costs, which were also not fully deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, the rate was impacted by the results of foreign income tax rate differential on the mix of earnings, non-deductible royalty expenses in certain jurisdictions, and certain foreign inclusion items on the domestic provision. 
 
 The Company s 2023 income tax expense and rate differed from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pre-tax income primarily as a result of foreign income tax rate differential on the mix of earnings, non-deductible royalty expenses in certain jurisdictions, the valuation allowance on the interest expense carryforward, and certain foreign inclusion items on the domestic provision. 
 
 Net (Loss) Income and (Loss) Earnings per Share 
 Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.2 million, compared to net income of 19.7 million in the comparable period of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, basic (loss) earnings per share were (0.25) and 0.31, respectively, and diluted (loss) earnings per share were (0.25) and 0.31, respectively. The Company's net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share changes were due to the items previously discussed. 
 
 Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8 million, compared to net income of 85.0 million in the comparable period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, basic (loss) earnings per share were (0.10) and 1.29, respectively, and diluted (loss) earnings per share were (0.10) and 1.29, respectively. The Company's net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share changes were due to the items previously discussed.

Agricultural Segment Results 
 Agricultural segment results for the periods presented below were as follows (amounts in thousands, except percentages): 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Decrease 
 2024 2023 Decrease 
 Net sales 175,439 212,967 (17.6) 631,442 787,973 (19.9) Gross profit 16,720 37,026 (54.8) 89,642 135,012 (33.6) Profit margin 9.5 17.4 (45.4) 14.2 17.1 (17.0) Income from operations 1,910 21,383 (91.1) 41,692 86,071 (51.6) 
 
 Net sales in the agricultural segment were 175.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 213.0 million for the comparable period in 2023. The net sales change was primarily attributed to a significant reduction in global demand for agricultural equipment, particularly in North America and Europe. Additionally, an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 4.9 further contributed to the change in net sales, mainly due to the weakening Brazilian real and Argentine peso. 
 
 Gross profit in the agricultural segment was 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 37.0 million in the comparable period in 2023. The change in gross profit was attributed to the lower sales volume, reduced fixed cost leverage, adverse price/mix effects, and increased material costs. 
 
 Income from operations in the Company's agricultural segment was 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 21.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in income from operations was mainly due to the lower gross profit resulting from the decline in net sales. 
 
 Net sales in the agricultural segment were 631.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 788.0 million for the comparable period in 2023. The net sales change was primarily attributed to lower sales volume in North and South America, reflecting the soft demand for agricultural equipment and a decline in Brazilian economic activity. The unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation by 4.8 also contributed to the change in net sales, mainly due to the weakening Argentine peso and Turkish lira. 
 
 Gross profit in the agricultural segment was 89.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 135.0 million in the comparable period in 2023. The change in gross profit was attributed to the lower sales volume, negative price/mix, higher material costs, and inventory revaluation step-up associated with the Carlstar purchase price allocation.

 Income from operations in the Company's agricultural segment was 41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 86.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall change in income from operations was primarily due to the lower gross profit resulting from the decrease in net sales. 
 
 Earthmoving/Construction Segment Results 
 Earthmoving/construction segment results for the periods presented below were as follows (amounts in thousands, except percentages): 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Decrease 
 2024 2023 Decrease

 The Company's earthmoving/construction segment net sales were 136.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 155.0 million in the comparable period in 2023. The change in net sales was primarily attributed to reduced sales volume due to softer demand in North America and Europe, which was partially offset by positive contributions from the Carlstar acquisition. Additionally, adverse price/mix effects due to reductions in steel and energy costs and a 1.1 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation contributed to the overall change. 
 
 Gross profit in the earthmoving/construction segment was 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in gross profit was primarily attributed to lower sales volume in North America and Europe, and reduced fixed cost leverage. 
 
 The Company's earthmoving/construction segment loss from operations was 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to an income of 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to lower sales volume, which adversely affected fixed cost leverage and gross margins. 
 
 The Company's earthmoving/construction segment net sales were 467.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 528.7 million in the comparable period in 2023. The change in earthmoving/construction sales was mainly due to reduced sales volume in the Americas and Europe, a slowdown among construction OEM customers, lower steel prices in Europe, and a 0.7 negative impact from foreign currency translation. 
 
 Gross profit in the earthmoving/construction segment was 55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 88.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Similar to the three-month period, the change in gross profit was attributed to lower sales volume, negative/price mix, and reduced fixed cost leverage. 
 
 The Company's earthmoving/construction segment income from operations was 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 46.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was a result of lower sales volume impacting gross margins.

 Consumer Segment Results 
 Consumer segment results for the periods presented below were as follows (amounts in thousands, except percentages): 
 
 Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Increase 
 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) 
 Net sales 136,233 33,769 303.4 363,837 114,976 216.4 Gross profit 30,432 6,790 348.2 71,046 23,930 196.9 Profit margin 22.3 20.1 10.9 19.5 20.8 (6.3) Income from operations 11,282 4,526 149.3 22,844 17,183 32.9 
 
 Consumer segment net sales were 136.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 33.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This growth was primarily attributed to higher sales volumes following the Carlstar acquisition, although it was partially offset by reduced sales in the Americas due to challenging market conditions and a 3.2 negative impact from foreign currency translation, mainly due to the weakening Brazilian real. 
 
 Gross profit from the consumer segment was 30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit and profit margin was largely driven by the benefits derived from the Carlstar acquisition. 
 
 Consumer segment income from operations was 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the higher gross profit generated from the acquisition. 
 
 Consumer segment net sales were 363.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 115.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly driven by the favorable effects of the Carlstar acquisition, although it was partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Americas due to adverse market conditions and a 2.1 negative impact from foreign currency, primarily due to the weakening Brazilian real. 
 
 Gross profit from the consumer segment was 71.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit was influenced by the Carlstar acquisition. The change in profit margin from 20.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 19.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a 9.4 million inventory revaluation step-up associated with the acquisition. 
 
 Consumer segment income from operations was 22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income of 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by the higher gross profit attributable to the factors mentioned above. 
 
 Corporate Unallocated Expenses 
 Income from operations on a segment basis did not include unallocated costs of 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 28.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Unallocated expenses are primarily comprised of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in corporate and unallocated expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was mainly attributed to higher SG A expenses, particularly professional service fees. The increase in corporate and unallocated expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to transaction costs of 6.2 million related to the Carlstar acquisition in the first quarter of 2024.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash Flows 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 227.3 million of cash, which increased as compared to the December 31, 2023 ending balance of 220.3 million, due to the following items: 
 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Summary of cash flows from operating activities: 
 (Amounts in thousands) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net (loss) income (4,803) 84,988 (89,791) Depreciation and amortization 40,059 31,598 8,461 Deferred income tax provision 21,646 5,868 15,778 Income on indirect taxes (3,096) 3,096 Proceeds from property insurance settlement (3,537) (3,537) Foreign currency loss (gain) 1,375 (2,348) 3,723 Accounts receivable 28,886 17,503 11,383 Inventories 53,914 32,197 21,717 Prepaid and other current assets 10,856 18,386 (7,530) Accounts payable (28,502) (62,751) 34,249 Other current liabilities 8,317 12,241 (3,924) Other liabilities 1,417 1,310 107 Other operating activities 3,123 4,210 (1,087) Cash provided by operating activities 132,751 140,106 (7,355) 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities was 132.8 million. This was mainly driven by working capital reduction and non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense of 40.1 million and deferred income tax provision of 21.6 million. Additionally, the Company incurred 6.2 million in transaction costs associated with the Carlstar acquisition in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Operating cash flows decreased by 7.4 million when comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the comparable period in 2023. This decline was primarily attributed to lower net income, partially offset by the positive impact of focused working capital management. Key factors contributing to this management included a 34.2 million increase in accounts payable, a 11.4 million improvement due to collections efforts on accounts receivable, and a 21.7 million improvement in inventory management. 
 
 Summary of the components of cash conversion cycle: 
 September 30, December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2023 Days sales outstanding 56 51 54 Days inventory outstanding 111 104 101 Days payable outstanding (57) (57) (55) Cash conversion cycle 110 98 100

 TITAN INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Cash conversion cycle increased by 10 days when comparing September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the Carlstar acquisition, which led to additional accounts receivable and inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2024, as a result of its customer mix and use of distribution centers to have product on demand for customers. Inventory management is critical for the business in preparation for the future periods to supply customers efficiently, which was the driver of increased days in inventory at the end of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Summary of cash flows from investing activities: 
 (Amounts in thousands) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Capital expenditures (52,318) (41,480) (10,838) Business acquisition, net of cash acquired (143,643) (143,643) Proceeds from sale of investment 1,791 1,791 Proceeds from property insurance settlement 3,537 3,537 Proceeds from sale of fixed assets 1,603 1,795 (192) Cash used for investing activities (189,030) (39,685) (149,345) 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, Titan reported a net cash outflow of 189.0 million from investing activities, as compared to the 39.7 million outflow recorded in the same period of 2023. This rise was primarily attributed to the acquisition of Carlstar for a cash consideration of 143.6 million, which included an additional payment of 19.8 million for excess working capital to the sellers, which has now been recovered through active working capital management. The Company also invested a total of 52.3 million in capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 41.5 million in the corresponding period of 2023. These capital expenditures were directed toward the replacement and enhancement of plant equipment, as well as the procurement of new tools, dies, and molds to support new product development initiatives. The increased capital outlay in 2024 includes the impact of Carlstar capital expenditures, and also reflects Titan's strategic efforts to improve its existing facilities, enhance manufacturing capabilities, and drive operational efficiency and labor productivity gains. The proceeds from property insurance settlement of 3.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 was related to the repair of one of our operating facilities in Italy associated with a 2023 hail storm weather event. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Summary of cash flows from financing activities: 
 (Amounts in thousands) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Proceeds from borrowings 159,614 6,628 152,986 Payment on debt (66,601) (25,017) (41,584) Payment of debt issuance costs (3,115) (3,115) Repurchase of common stock (16,106) (19,064) 2,958 Other financing activities (738) (2,540) 1,802 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 73,054 (39,993) 113,047 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, 73.1 million cash was provided by financing activities. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of Carlstar on February 29, 2024, for which Titan borrowed 147.0 million under a new domestic credit facility. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2023, 40.0 million cash was used for financing activities. The Company made debt payments of 25.0 million and repurchased common stock of 19.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings of 6.6 million. 
 
 Additionally, Titan issued common stock worth 168.7 million in connection with the business acquisition of Carlstar. This was reflected in Non cash financing activity in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Liquidity Outlook 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 227.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2024, there were 97.0 million of borrowings under the Company's 225 million credit facility. Titan's availability under this credit facility may be less than 225 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit and eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances at certain domestic and Canadian subsidiaries. Based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances, the Company's amount available for borrowing totaled 191.0 million at September 30, 2024. With outstanding letters of credit totaling 9.9 million and 97.0 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the net amount available for borrowing under the credit facility totaled 84.1 million at September 30, 2024. The cash and cash equivalents balance of 227.3 million included 210.7 million held in foreign countries. Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for subsequent event impacting liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 The Company is expecting full year capital expenditures to be approximately 65 million to 70 million. These capital expenditures are anticipated to be used primarily to continue to enhance the Company s existing facilities and manufacturing capabilities and drive productivity gains, along with the purchase of new tools, dies and molds related to new product development. 
 
 Cash payments for interest are currently forecasted to between 16 million and 18 million for the remainder of 2024 based on September 30, 2024 debt balances. The forecasted interest payment is comprised primarily of the semi-annual payment of 14 million to be paid in October 2024 for the 7.00 senior secured notes, and between 2 million and 3 million of payments on the credit facility, which will be variable dependent upon on the prevailing SOFR rate and outstanding debt levels within each month. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents along with anticipated internal cash flows from operations and utilization of availability on global credit facilities, are expected to provide sufficient liquidity for working capital needs, debt maturities, and capital expenditures. Potential divestitures and unencumbered assets may also be a means to provide for future liquidity needs.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Titan management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, Titan's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Titan in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported accurately and within the time frames specified in the SEC's rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to Titan management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As disclosed in Note 2. Business Combination in Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, Titan acquired Carlstar on February 29, 2024. The total revenues of Carlstar represented approximately 28.8 and 21.6 of the total net sales as shown on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and Carlstar s total assets constituted approximately 12.9 of total assets as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. Titan is currently integrating Carlstar into our overall internal control over financial reporting process and, consistent with interpretive guidance issued by the Staff of the SEC, is excluding the business from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In accordance with such guidance, an assessment of recent business combinations may be omitted from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for up to one year following the acquisition. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 As noted above, we acquired Carlstar on February 29, 2024. We are integrating Carlstar into our overall internal control over 
 financial reporting process. At this time, we anticipate that the scope of our assessment of our internal control over financial 
 reporting for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 will exclude Carlstar s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Other than as set forth above, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
