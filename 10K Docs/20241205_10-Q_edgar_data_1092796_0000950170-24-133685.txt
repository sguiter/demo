All statements other than statements of historical facts contained or incorporated herein by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future operating results, future financial position, business strategy, objectives, goals, plans, prospects, markets, and plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, targets, contemplates, projects, predicts, may, might, plan, will, would, should, could, may, can, potential, continue, objective, or the negative of those terms, or similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Specific forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements regarding plans to vacate the Deep River, Connecticut facility in December 2024 our current belief that there are no indications of impairment relating to assets being utilized at the Deep River facility; expected undiscounted cashflows, based on the Assignment and Assumption Agreement (as defined herein), for future periods; lease payments for all our operating and finance leases for future periods; our expectation that the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs and PSUs will be recognized over a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.6 years; our belief that the remaining claims asserted by Gemini (as defined herein) against us have no merit and our intention to aggressively defend against this action; our belief with respect to certain matters described in the Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation section that the allegations are unfounded and, in addition, that any incident and any results from them or any injuries were due to negligence or misuse of the firearm by the claimant or a third party; our belief that our accruals for product liability cases and claims are a reasonable quantitative measure of the cost to us of product liability cases and claims; our belief that an unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation could harm our business; our belief that we are vigorously defending ourselves in lawsuits to which we are subject; our conclusion that we are unable to reasonably estimate the probability or the estimated range of reasonably possible losses related to material adverse judgments related to such lawsuits and our determination not to accrue for and judgments in such lawsuits; our belief that we have provided adequate accruals for defense costs; our intention, in connection with our new facility in Maryville, Tennessee, to incur, or cause to be incurred, no less than 120.0 million in aggregate capital expenditures on or before December 31, 2025, create no less than 620 new jobs, and sustain an average hourly wage of at least 25.97 at the facility; our expectation, when adding the cost of machinery and equipment, to spend between 165.0 million and 170.0 million through the end of fiscal 2025; our belief that inventory levels, both internally and in the distribution channel, in excess of demand may negatively impact future operating results; our expectation that our inventory levels will decline during the remainder of the fiscal year; our expectation for capital expenditures in fiscal 2025; factors affecting our future capital requirements; availability of equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, if at all; the record date and payment date for our dividend; and our belief that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations for the next 12 months. All forward-looking statements included herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and speak only as of such date. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. The forward-looking statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our views as of the date hereof about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and changes in circumstances that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, performance, or achievements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, economic, political, social, legislative, regulatory, inflationary, and health factors; the results of the 2024 elections; the potential for increased regulation of firearms and firearm-related products; actions of social activists that could have an adverse effect on our business; the impact of lawsuits; the demand for our products; the state of the U.S. economy in general and the firearm industry in particular; general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns; our competitive environment; the supply, availability, and costs of raw materials and components; speculation surrounding fears of terrorism and crime; our anticipated growth and growth opportunities; our ability to effectively manage and execute the Relocation; our ability to increase demand for our products in various markets, including consumer, law enforcement, and military channels, domestically and internationally; our penetration rates in new and existing markets; our strategies; our ability to maintain and enhance brand recognition and reputation; our ability to introduce new products; the success of new products; our ability to expand our markets; the potential for cancellation of orders from our backlog; and other factors detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, or the Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.

million at any one time. On April 28, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the interest rate benchmark and amend the definition of Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to exclude unfinanced capital expenditures in connection with the Relocation. The revolving line bore interest at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) or the SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. On October 3, 2024, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, or the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with certain lenders, including TD Bank, N.A., as administrative agent; TD Securities (USA) LLC and Regions Bank, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners; and Regions Bank, as syndication agent. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is currently unsecured; however, should any Springing Lien Trigger Event (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) occur, we and certain of our subsidiaries would be required to execute certain documents in favor of TD Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party to such documents would have a legal, valid, and enforceable first priority lien on the collateral described therein. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of million at any one time, or The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides a swingline facility in the maximum amount of million at any one time (subject to availability under the Revolving Line). Subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions described in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we have an option to increase the Revolving Line by an aggregate amount not exceeding million. The Revolving Line matures on the earlier of or the date that is six months in advance of the earliest maturity of any Permitted Notes (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2024 , we had million of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Line, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of , which is equal to the SOFR rate plus an applicable margin. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary limitations, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes to business or organizational structure, investments, loans, advances, guarantees, and acquisitions, asset sales, dividends, stock repurchases, stock redemptions, and the redemption or prepayment of other debt, and transactions with affiliates. We are also subject to financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. As of October 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required financial covenants. Letters of Credit At October 31, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit aggregating million, which included a million letter of credit to collateralize our captive insurance company.

 million and million as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. The carrying value of our revolving line of credit approximated the fair value as of October 31, 2024. We utilized Level 1 of the value hierarchy to determine the fair values of these assets and liabilities. Level 2 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets in which trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets. Level 2 inputs include the following: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (such as corporate and municipal bonds which trade infrequently); 

 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (such as interest rate and currency swaps); and 

 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (such as certain securities and derivatives). 

 Level 3 Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect our judgments about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. We did t have any Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of October 31, 2024 .

() 

Diluted earnings 

For the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 , there were shares and shares, respectively, excluded from the computation of diluted earnings because the effect would be antidilutive. For the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 , there were and , respectively, shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings because the effect would be antidilutive. Incentive Stock and Employee Stock Purchase Plans We have two stock incentive plans: the 2013 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2022 Incentive Stock Plan, or the Incentive Stock Plans, under which employees and non-employees may be granted stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock and awards in lieu of obligations, performance awards, and dividend equivalents. No grants have been made under the 2013 Incentive Stock Plan since our stockholders approved the 2022 Incentive Stock Plan at our annual meeting of stockholders held in September 2022. All new grants are issued under the 2022 Incentive Stock Plan. We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, under which each participant is granted an option to purchase our common stock at a discount on each subsequent exercise date during the offering period (as such terms are defined in the ESPP) in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. The total stock-based compensation expense, including purchases under our ESPP and grants of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, or PSUs, under the Incentive Stock Plans, was million and million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We include stock-based compensation expense in cost of sales, sales, marketing, and distribution, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. We grant RSUs to employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors. The awards are made at no cost to the recipient. An RSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock and does not carry voting or dividend rights. Except in specific circumstances, RSU grants to employees vest over a period of with one-fourth of the units vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. We amortize the aggregate fair value of our RSU grants to compensation expense over the vesting period. We grant PSUs to our executive officers and, from time to time, certain management employees who are not executive officers. The PSUs vest, and the fair value of such PSUs will be recognized, over the corresponding performance period. During the six months ended October 31, 2024 , we granted an aggregate of RSUs, including RSUs to non-executive officer employees, RSUs to our executive officers, and RSUs to our directors. During the six months ended October 31, 2024 , we granted PSUs to certain of our executive officers.

As of October 31, 2024 , there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs and PSUs. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining contractual term of years. 

 million. In November 2019, we filed an answer to Gemini s complaint and a counterclaim against Gemini and its stockholders at the time of the signing of the asset purchase agreement. Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a claim of fraud in the inducement. In September 2021, Gemini filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss our counterclaim. In June 2022, the District Court denied Gemini's motion for summary judgment. Gemini filed a second motion for summary judgment, and in August 2023, the District Court again denied Gemini s motion. In November 2023, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs on the indemnity and counterclaims. On the same day, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave, seeking to file a second amended complaint. On January 31, 2024, the District Court allowed plaintiffs amended allegations of fraud, and denied without prejudice their motion to add punitive damages. On February 9, 2024, the District Court set a trial date for January 6, 2025. On August 7, 2024, the District Court issued a 45-day stay of the case and vacated the January 6, 2025 trial date. On September 25, 2024, the District Court entered an order granting an additional 45-day stay of the case. We believe the claims asserted in the complaint have no merit, and we intend to aggressively defend this action. We are a defendant in product liability cases and are aware of other product liability claims, primarily alleging defective product design, defective manufacturing, or failure to provide adequate warnings. In addition, we are a co-defendant in a case filed in August 1999 by the city of Gary, Indiana, or the City, against numerous firearm manufacturers, distributors, and dealers seeking to recover monetary damages, as well as injunctive relief, allegedly arising out of the misuse of firearms by third parties. In January 2018, the Lake Superior Court, County of Lake, Indiana granted defendants Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, dismissing the case in its entirety. In February 2018, plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Indiana Court of Appeals. In May 2019, the Indiana Court of Appeals issued a decision, which affirmed in part and reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings, the trial court s dismissal of the City s complaint. In July 2019, defendants filed a Petition to Transfer jurisdiction to the Indiana Supreme Court. In November 2019, the Indiana Supreme Court denied defendants' petition to transfer, and the case was returned to the trial court. On March 15, 2024, IC 34-12-3.5 was signed into law. This law purported to prohibit political subdivisions in Indiana from bringing certain legal actions against certain firearm industry members and to apply to actions or suits filed before, after, or on August 27, 1999. On March 18, 2024, defendants filed a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the new law. On May 17, 2024, plaintiffs filed an opposition to defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. On August 12, 2024, the trial court denied defendants joint motion for judgment on the pleadings. On October 16, 2024, the trial court stayed the trial court proceedings pending an interlocutory appeal with the Indiana Court of Appeals. We believe the claims asserted in the complaint are without merit and intend to aggressively defend this action.

 . The action claims CAD million in aggregate general damages, CAD million in aggregate punitive damages, special damages in an unspecified amount, together with interest and legal costs. The named plaintiffs are victims of a shooting that took place in Toronto in July 2018 and their family members. One victim was shot and injured during the shooting. The other victim suffered unspecified injuries while fleeing the shooting. The plaintiffs sought to certify a claim on behalf of classes that include all persons who were killed or injured in the shooting and their immediate family members. The plaintiffs allege negligent design and public nuisance. The case has not been certified as a class action. In July 2020, we filed a Notice of Motion for an order striking the claim and dismissing the action in its entirety. In February 2021, the court granted our motion in part, and dismissed the plaintiffs claims in public nuisance and strict liability. The court declined to strike the negligent design claim and ordered that the claim proceed to a certification motion. In March 2021, we filed a motion for leave to appeal the court s refusal to strike the negligent design claim with the Divisional Court, Ontario Superior Court of Justice. In July 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion to stay our motion for leav e to appeal with the Divisional Court, on grounds that appeal is premature. In November 2021, the Divisional Court granted plaintiffs' motion, staying our motion for leave to appeal until 30 days after the decision on the balance of plaintiffs' certification motion. A hearing on plaintiffs certification motion was held in January 2024. On March 5, 2024, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Three appeals have been filed, all of which will be heard together in the Court of Appeal for Ontario: (1) our appeal from the dismissal of our motion to strike the negligent design claim; (2) the plaintiffs appeal from the order striking out their public nuisance and strict liability claims; and, (3) the plaintiffs appeal from the order dismissing their certification motion. On August 6, 2024, we filed our motion regarding our appeal from the dismissal of our motion to strike the negligent design claim and plaintiffs filed their motion regarding their appeal from the order striking out their public nuisance and strict liability claims and their appeal from the order dismissing their certification motion. The Court of Appeals for Ontario is scheduled to hear the appeals together on December 9, 2024. In May 2020, we were named in an action related to the Chabad of Poway synagogue shooting that took place in April 2019. The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego Central, and asserts claims against us for product liability, unfair competition, negligence, and public nuisance. The plaintiffs allege they were present at the synagogue on the day of the incident and suffered physical and/or emotional injury. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys fees, and injunctive relief. In September 2020, we filed a demurrer and motion to strike, seeking to dismiss plaintiffs complaint. In July 2021, the court granted our motion in part, and reversed it in part, ruling that (1) the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act barred plaintiffs product liability action; (2) plaintiffs did not have standing to maintain an action under the Unfair Competition Law for personal injury related damages, but gave plaintiffs leave to amend to plead an economic injury; and (3) the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act did not bar plaintiffs ordinary negligence and public nuisance actions because plaintiffs had alleged that we violated 18 U.S.C. Section 922(b)(4), which generally prohibits the sale of fully automatic machineguns. In August 2021, we filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate in the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Fourth Appellate District, Division One. In September 2021, the Court of Appeal denied our appeal. In February 2022, the court consolidated the case with three related cases, in which we are not a party. In March 2022, the court granted our motion, dismissing plaintiffs Unfair Competition Law claim, without further leave to amend. On February 28, 2023, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On May 19, 2023, the court denied our motion for summary judgment without prejudice and allowed plaintiffs time for additional discovery. A hearing on our renewed motion for summary judgment was held on October 11, 2024. Discovery is ongoing. On December 2, 2024, the court granted our renewed motion for summary judgment. We are a defendant in an action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In August 2021, the Mexican Government filed an action against several U.S.-based firearms manufacturers and a firearms distributor, claiming defendants design, market, distribute, and sell firearms in ways they know routinely arm the drug cartels in Mexico. Plaintiff alleges, among other claims, negligence, public nuisance, design defect, unjust enrichment and restitution against all defendants and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act against us alone, and is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In November 2021, defendants filed motions to dismiss plaintiff's complaint. In September 2022, the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss. In October 2022, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. On January 22, 2024, the First Circuit reversed the trial court s dismissal of the case. On April 18, 2024, defendants filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 7, 2024, the district court dismissed the case against six of the eight defendants in the suit (excluding us) based on personal jurisdiction grounds. On October 4, 2024, the U.S Supreme Court granted defendants Petition for Writ of Certiorari. On October 31, 2024, the district court issued an order staying the case in its entirety pending the U.S. Supreme Court s review of the case. In September 2022, we were named as defendants in 12 nearly identical, separate actions related to a shooting in Highland Park, Illinois on July 4, 2022. The complaints were filed in the Circuit Court of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit in Lake County, Illinois and assert claims against us for negligence and deceptive and unfair practices under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. The plaintiffs allege they were present at a parade at the time of the incident and suffered physical and/or emotional injury. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, attorneys fees, and injunctive relief. We filed motions for removal of each case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In November 2022, we filed a motion to consolidate the cases for preliminary motion

 to approximately million. In our experience, initial demands do not generally bear a reasonable relationship to the facts and circumstances of a particular matter. We believe that our accruals for product liability cases and claims are a reasonable quantitative measure of the cost to us of product liability cases and claims. We were also involved in a putative stockholder derivative lawsuit filed on December 5, 2023 in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada. The action was brought by plaintiffs seeking to act on our behalf against our directors and certain of our executive officers. The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duties by knowingly allowing us to become exposed to significant liability for intentionally violating federal, state, and local laws through our manufacturing, marketing, and sale of AR-15 style rifles." The derivative plaintiffs sought damages on our behalf from the individual defendants, as well as reforms and improvements to our compliance procedures and governance policies. On March 19, 2024, the court granted our motion to require security pursuant to Nevada law. On May 6, 2024, the court dismissed plaintiffs action without prejudice for failing to post a bond pursuant to the court s order. On July 10 and 11, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order of dismissal without prejudice and case appeal statement, respectively. On July 25, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of posting of bond on appeal. On November 21, 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court issued an order dismissing the appeal, pursuant to the stipulation of the parties. We are vigorously defending ourselves in the lawsuits to which we are subject. An unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation could harm our business. Litigation of this nature also is expensive, time consuming, and diverts the time and attention of our management. We monitor the status of known claims and the related product liability accrual, which includes amounts for defense costs for asserted and unasserted claims. After consultation with litigation counsel and a review of the merit of each claim, we have concluded that we are unable to reasonably estimate the probability or the estimated range of reasonably possible losses related to material adverse

Further, pursuant to the Project Agreement, we are required to, among other things, (A) execute a facility lease and an equipment lease with the IDB; (B) cause the construction of the new facility at our sole cost and expense to commence on or before May 31, 2022; (C) incur, or cause to be incurred, aggregate capital expenditures in connection with the construction and equipping of the new facility in an aggregate amount of not less than million on or before December 31, 2025; (D) cause the construction of the new facility to be substantially completed and for a certificate of occupancy to be issued therefore on or before December 31, 2023; (E) provide the IDB with a written report certified by one of our authorized officers, not later than January 31 of each year during the period between January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2031; and (F) make certain payments to IDB in the event that our actual capital expenditures, number of employees, or average hourly wage of such employees are less than our projections. design-build agreement with The Christman Company, or Christman, related to the construction of our Maryville facility, or the Construction Contract. The Construction Contract has an effective date of September 13, 2021 and incorporates the arrangements under which we and Christman have been proceeding. Pursuant to the Construction Contract, Christman is obligated to deliver certain services, including, among others, design phase services and construction phase services, and we are obligated to pay Christman for services performed. The parties to the Construction Contract agreed that Christman will perform and complete the Work (as defined therein) on a cost-plus basis for a guaranteed minimum price of million, including contingencies. When adding the cost of machinery and equipment, we expect to spend between million and million through the end of fiscal 2025. Through October 31, 2024 , we had incurred million of capital expenditures related to the Relocation. The Construction Contract includes terms that are customary for contracts of this type, including with respect to indemnification and insurance. The Construction Contract lists certain contract milestones and guaranteed completion dates, and we will be entitled to liquidated damages under certain circumstances. Each party to the Construction Contract is entitled to terminate the Construction Contract under certain circumstances. During the six months ended October 31, 2023, we determined that we would have no use for certain distribution equipment in our Missouri Distribution Center and could not fully recover the net book value of such equipment. Therefore, we recorded an impairment of million during that period. In connection with the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, we vacated the Missouri Distribution Center effective January 1, 2024 and sold assets we could no longer utilize to AOUT at their remaining net book value of million, relocating all remaining assets to our Maryville facility. In addition, we relocated a portion of our plastic injection molding operations to the Maryville facility. As of October 31, 2024 , the plastic injection molding machinery and equipment was being utilized in our Deep River facility had been relocated to the Maryville facility, or had been disposed. We do not believe there are any indications of impairment relating to assets being utilized at the Deep River facility.

Sales of our handguns increased 5.5 million, or 6.2 , over the comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of increased shipments of newly introduced products (defined as any new SKU not shipped in the comparable quarter last year), which represented 46.8 of handgun sales in the period, and a 2 to 5 price increase that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by a shift in product mix to lower priced models. Handgun unit shipments into the sporting goods channel increased by 19.2 over the comparable quarter last year while overall consumer handgun demand remained relatively flat (as indicated by adjusted background checks reported in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS). 
 Sales of our long guns decreased 3.0 million, or 10.6 , from the comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of the timing of new product launches in the comparable quarter last year, partially offset by a shift in product mix to higher priced models, as well as a 2 to 5 price increase on select products that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Shipments of newly introduced products represented 54.4 of long gun sales in the period. Long gun unit shipments into our sporting goods channel decreased 26.4 from the comparable quarter last year while overall consumer demand for long guns increased 3.6 (as indicated by NICS). 
 Other products and services revenue increased 2.2 million, or 26.5 , over the comparable quarter last year, primarily because of increased suppressor and component parts sales. 
 Newly introduced products represented 44.4 of net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and included six new pistols, three new long guns, and many new product line extensions. 
 Gross margin for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 26.6 compared with 25.4 for the comparable quarter last year, primarily because of a 3.2 million legal settlement recognized in the prior year comparable quarter. Excluding the impact of the prior year legal settlement, gross margin was lower by 130 basis points due to higher labor and overhead costs, partially offset by lower inventory adjustments (including standard cost revaluations, shrink, and excess inventory write downs) and favorable fixed-cost absorption from higher production volumes. 
 Inventory balances increased 35.5 million between April 30, 2024 and October 31, 2024 as a result of a slowdown in demand combined with level loading of our manufacturing facilities to ensure our ability to satisfy anticipated future demand. While inventory levels, both internally and in the distribution channel, in excess of demand may negatively impact future operating results, it is difficult to forecast the potential impact of distributor inventories on future revenue and income as demand is impacted by many factors, including seasonality, new product introductions, news events, political events, and consumer tastes. We expect our inventory levels to decline during the remainder of the fiscal year.

Sales of our handguns decreased 27.4 million, or 15.7 , from the comparable period last year, primarily as a result of lower consumer demand within the industry and a shift in product mix to lower priced models, partially offset by increased shipments of newly introduced products, which represented 43.0 of handgun sales in the period, and a 2 to 5 price increase that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

 Other products and services revenue increased 3.2 million, or 18.1 , over the comparable period last year, primarily because of increased suppressor and component parts sales, partially offset by lower handcuff and business-to-business sales. 
 Newly introduced products represented 43.2 of net sales for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and included six new pistols, four new long guns, and many new product line extensions. 
 Gross margin for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was 26.9 compared with 26.0 for the comparable period last year, primarily because of a 3.2 million legal settlement recognized in the prior year comparable period.

Research and development expenses increased 497,000 over the prior year comparable quarter because of higher materials and testing costs associated with new product development. Selling, marketing, and distribution expenses decreased 1.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter, primarily as a result of one-time costs related to our grand opening event at our Maryville facility in the prior year comparable quarter and lower spending on promotions. General and administrative expenses increased 457,000 over the prior year comparable quarter, primarily because of higher legal costs, partially offset by lower compensation-related expense and lower professional services.

Research and development expenses increased 1.2 million over the prior year comparable period because of higher materials and testing costs associated with new product development and higher compensation-related costs. Selling, marketing, and distribution expenses decreased 1.6 million from the prior year comparable period, primarily as a result of a 1.9 million impairment on distribution equipment related to the Relocation and one-time costs related to our grand opening event at our Maryville facility in the prior year comparable period. Excluding the impact of these one-time prior year charges, selling, marketing, and distribution expenses increased 1.2 million, primarily as a result of the timing of certain industry events and higher spending on promotions. General and administrative expenses decreased 56,000 from the prior year comparable period, primarily because of lower Relocation costs, lower profit sharing expense, and lower compensation-related expense, partially offset by higher legal costs.

Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities was 38.2 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared with 37.8 million of cash provided for the six months ended October 31, 2023. Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was unfavorably impacted by a 35.5 million increase in inventory compared with a 13.8 million decrease in inventory in the prior comparable period, a 10.1 million decrease in accounts payable compared with a 14.7 million increase in accounts payable in the prior comparable period, and a 3.9 million decrease in accrued payroll and incentives compared with a 1.3 million increase in accrued payroll and incentives in the prior comparable period. Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was favorably impacted by a 6.4 million decrease in accounts receivable compared with a 4.6 million increase in accounts receivable in the prior comparable period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 59.2 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared with the prior year comparable period. We paid 8.0 million for capital expenditures for the six months ended October 31, 2024, 58.9 million lower than the prior year comparable period, primarily as a result of payments related to the Relocation in the prior year period. 
 We currently expect to spend 25.0 million to 30.0 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2025. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 24.3 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared with 19.9 million of cash provided in financing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily the result of 60 million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit, partially offset by 22.6 million of share repurchases and 11.7 million in dividend distributions. 
 Credit Facilities We entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on October 3, 2024. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of 175.0 million at any one time, or the Revolving Line. The Revolving Line bears interest at either the Base Rate (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) or the SOFR rate, plus an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides a swingline facility in the maximum amount of 5.0 million at any one time (subject to availability under the Revolving Line). Each Swingline Loan (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) bears interest at the Base Rate, plus an applicable margin based on our Adjusted Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions described in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we have an option to increase the Revolving Line by an aggregate amount not exceeding 50.0 million. The Revolving Line matures on the earlier of October 3, 2029 or the date that is six months in advance of the earliest maturity of any Permitted Notes (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had 100.0 million of borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Line, bearing interest at an average rate of 6.92 , which was equal to the SOFR rate plus an applicable margin. 
 The credit agreement for our credit facility contains financial covenants relating to maintaining maximum leverage and minimum debt service coverage. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 31, 2024. 
 24 

Share Repurchase Programs On September 19, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50.0 million of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions through September 19, 2024, or the 2023 Authorization. During fiscal 2024, we purchased 793,551 shares of our common stock for 10.2 million under the 2023 Authorization. During fiscal 2025, we purchased 1,531,763 shares of our common stock for 21.4 million under the 2023 Authorization. The 2023 Authorization expired on September 19, 2024. On September 5, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50.0 million of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from September 20, 2024 through September 20, 2025, or the 2024 Authorization. During fiscal 2025, we have repurchased 92,537 shares of our common stock for 1.2 million under the 2024 Authorization. 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we repurchased a total of 753,631 shares of our common stock for 9.8 million. During the six months ended October 31, 2024, we repurchased a total of 1,624,300 shares of our common stock for 22.6 million. 
 Dividends In June 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a regular quarterly dividend for stockholders of 0.13 per share. The next dividend will be for stockholders of record as of market close on December 19, 2024 and will be payable on January 2, 2025. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including net sales, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, and costs related to the Relocation. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had 39.1 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based upon our current working capital position, current operating plans, and expected business conditions, we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.
