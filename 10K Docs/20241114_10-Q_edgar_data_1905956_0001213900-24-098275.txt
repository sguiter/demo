Southeast
Asia SEA consumers have access to a plethora of smart ordering, delivery and loyalty websites and

ZCITY App targets consumer through the provision of personalized deals based on consumers purchase history, location and preferences.
Our technology platform allows us to identify the spending trends of our customers (the when, where, why, and how much). We are able
to offer these personalized deals through the application of our proprietary artificial intelligence (or AI technology

behavior and roll out attractive rewards-based campaigns for targeted audiences. We believe this AI technology is currently a unique
market differentiator for the ZCITY App.

operate our ZCITY App on the hashtag: #RewardsOnRewards. We believe this branding demonstrates to users the ability
to spend ZCITY App-based Reward Points (or RP and ZCITY Cash Vouchers with discount benefits at checkout.

-Business
Development 

Since December 2022, we have been developing the TAZTE
Smart F B system TAZTE ), a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate digital transformation for registered food
and beverage F B outlets across Malaysia. TAZTE was conceived as a merchant-centric program, intended to leverage
user data to drive substantial business growth for our merchant clientele. We initially offered a complimentary trial period to merchants,
which was scheduled to conclude on December 31, 2023. This trial period was later extended until June 2024. However, due to insufficient
participation from merchant clients, management has decided to discontinue the program as of June 2024. 

Since July 2024, we formalized agreements to develop and implement a Smart Campus System at ELMU University in Nilai, Malaysia. Leveraging
our expertise in infrastructure management, we are working with ELMU University to deploy an automated smart campus system that will enhance
resource management across the campus, with a strong focus on optimizing electricity usage through integrated software and hardware solutions.
This initiative aims to achieve an efficient energy saving consumptions and better environmental, social and governance. The project is
expected to be fully deployed within 12 months from the contract s commencement date. 

Since September 2024, we have been driving the development
of credit services within the ZCity App through a strategic partnership with Credilab Sdn Bhd CLSB ). We are in the midst
of facilitating the integration of CLSB s credit services platform into the ZCity App and developing the customer base for these
services. Through the partnership, we intend to collaborate on the creation of a digital wallet, AI-driven chatbot, and customer support
systems. The collaboration is designed to drive user engagement and enhance the overall credit services offering within the ZCity App
ecosystem. The partnership is scheduled to conclude on September 19, 2029, during which CLSB has also granted TGL a non-exclusive right
to use its brand in marketing materials for five years. 

Since October 2024, we have been advancing our user
engagement strategy by partnering with Octagram Investment Limited OCTA to develop and integrate mini-game modules into
the ZCity App. We have worked closely with OCTA to design and customize these interactive modules, ensuring they align with our specifications
for game mechanics, branding, and user experience. The integration is optimized for cross-platform compatibility and smooth performance
across devices, as well as ensuring ongoing support and timely updates, maintaining the seamless functionality of the mini-games with
future ZCity App updates. We believe that this initiative is key to enhancing the app s interactive features and driving user engagement. 

In October 2024, we have also been developing a cutting-edge Live Streaming
Platform enhanced by AI Digital Human Solutions by partnering with V Gallant Sdn Bhd. We will be overseeing the customization of the
platform to meet specific requirements, ensuring seamless integration with third-party platforms and optimizing performance across devices.
Ongoing support and updates will also be prioritized to maintain consistent functionality. This initiative is central to our efforts
to expand our interactive streaming capabilities and elevate user experiences. The development is scheduled to be completed on December
31, 2025 . 

Key
Factors that Affect Operating Results 

We
believe the key factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations include the following: 

Our
Ability to Create Value for Our Users and Generate Revenue 

Our
ability to create value for our users and generate our revenues from merchants is driven by the factors described below: 

Number
and volume of transactions completed by our consumers . 

Consumers
are attracted to ZCITY by the breadth of personalized deals/rewards and the interactive user experience our platform offers. The number
and volume of transaction completed by our member consumers is affected by our ability to continue to enhance and expand our product
and service offerings and improve the user experience. 

Empowering
data and technology. 

Our
ability to engage our member consumers and empower our merchants and their brands is affected by the breadth and depth of our data insights,
such as the accuracy of our members shopping preferences, and our technology capabilities and infrastructure, and our continued
ability to develop scalable services and upgrade our platform user experience to adapt to the quickly evolving industry trends and consumer
preferences. 

Our
Investment in User Base, Technology, People and Infrastructure 

We
have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platform to attract consumers and merchants, enhance user experience
and expand the capabilities and scope of our platform. We expect to continue to invest in our research and development team as well as
in our technology capabilities and infrastructure, which will lower our margins but deliver overall long-term growth. 

36 

Inflation 

Although
Malaysia is experiencing a high inflation rate, we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business as
September 30, 2024, but we will continue to monitor the effects of inflation on our business in future periods. 

Supply
Chain Disruptions 

Although
there have been Russia s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the 2023 Middle East conflicts that may have affected the operations
of some of our online and offline merchants, these disruptions have not had a material adverse effect on our business as of September
30, 2024, but we will continue to monitor the effects of above mentioned disruptions on our business in future periods. 

Key
Operating Metrics 

Our
management regularly reviews a number of metrics to evaluate our business, measures our performance, identifies trends, formulates financial
projections and makes strategic decisions. The main metrics we consider, and our results for last five quarters, are set forth in the

We
have experienced a decrease in growth rate in registered users, and a decline of active users over our last five quarters as of September
30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded 2,704,482 registered users and 25,216 active users on the ZCITY platform. On average,
our registered user base has grown by approximately 2.0 over the past five quarters, while our active user numbers have experienced
an average decline of 38.3 . 

The
decline in growth of registered users and active users over the past five quarters, as of September 30, 2024, is primarily attributed
to reduced E-voucher purchases from our vendor, resulting in fewer E-vouchers available for sale. Additionally, we ve implemented
reductions in marketing spending and customer rewards to enhance cost-effectiveness and operational profitability. Consequently, this
has led to a decrease in new user registrations and lower retention rates among active users on our ZCITY platform. 

We
continuously monitor the development and participation of active users as a proportion of its total registered user base to ensure the
effectiveness of our marketing and feature implantation strategies. Accordingly, the proportion of total registered users that we consider
active users at the end last five quarters as of September 30, 2024 is as follows:

Total revenues decreased by approximately 13.3
million or 98.5 to approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 13.5 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in product and loyalty program revenue. 

38 

Product
and loyalty program revenue 

Product
revenue was generated through sales of our e-voucher, health care products and other products through our ZCITY platform while loyalty
program revenue was recognized when our customers redeem their previously earned reward points from our loyalty program or upon expiration
of the reward point. In addition, we also engage in sales of food and beverage products through our subsidiaries, Morgan and AY Food,
despite they were disposed in May 2024. The product and loyalty program revenue decrease by approximately 13.1 million or 99.4 to approximately
 82,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 13.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decline in revenue
was primarily driven by the company s strategic decision to streamline its product line, with a particular focus on eliminating
lower-margin products, mainly e-vouchers. In addition, the decrease was attributable our strategic decision to reduce spending on customer
rewards and marketing campaigns in order to enhance cost-effectiveness and profitability in our operations. This reduction in customer
incentives and marketing expenditures resulted in a decrease in the platform s appeal to both existing and potential customers,
ultimately leading to a decline in revenue for the current period. 

Transaction
revenue 

Transaction
revenue primarily consists of fees charged to merchants for participating in our ZCITY platform upon successful sales and service transactions,
as well as for payment services facilitated between merchants and their customers online. Our transaction revenue increased by 113.2 ,
reaching approximately 43,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 20,000 for the same period in
2023. This growth was driven by our recent partnership with Creditlab Sdn. Bhd. CLSB ), a third-party credit services provider.
Through this partnership, we introduced our portfolio clients from ZCITY to CLSB s credit service platform. In return, CLSB agreed to
pay us a transaction fee upon successful transactions and share 50 of the revenue derived from these Portfolio Clients. 

Member
subscription revenue 

Member
subscription revenue primarily consists of fees charged to customers who sign up for Zmember, our membership program that offers exclusive
savings, bonuses, and referral rewards. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, member subscription revenue decreased by 52.3 
to approximately 83,000, from approximately 0.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to we experienced
slowdown in acquiring new customers to participate in our Zmember program . As of September 30, 2024 we had 27,620 customers who subscribed
to our Zmember program, respectively. 

Sublicense
revenue 

As
we acquired exclusive worldwide license for right of use in Morganfield s Trademark, and Abe Yus s Trademark on May 1, 2023,
and June 6, 2023, respectively, for a period of five years, we have generated sublicense revenue consisting of fee charged to the customers
who sublicensed the right of use of the Trademark from us. As we had disposed Foodlink and its subsidiaries along with the food distribution
and sublicensing operation in May 2024, we would no longer generate revenue from sublicense going forward.

breakdown of cost of revenue by categories for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, is summarized below:

Our
gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to approximately 172,000 as compared to approximately 163,000
for the same period in 2023, reflecting an increase of approximately 9,000 or 5.9 . Our gross margin improved from 1.2 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to 83.0 for the same period in 2024, representing an enhancement of 81.8 in our gross margin percentage. 

The
increase in both gross profit and gross margin were mainly attributed to strategic measures undertaken during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 through streamlined our product line by eliminating products with lower profitability, and reduce spending on customer
rewards within our ZCITY platform which resulting in a decrease in deferred revenue. Consequently, leading to higher gross profit and
gross margin in the current period. 

Operating
expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses and stock-based
compensation expenses. 

40 

Selling
expenses 

Selling
expenses amounted to approximately 78,000 and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing
a decrease of approximately 0.7 million or 89.8 . The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in marketing and promotion expense
of approximately 0.7 million related to promoting our ZCITY platform. Marketing and promotion expense consists of redemptions of reward
points which is generated from non-spending related activities (registration as a new user, referral of a new user and Spin Win
eligibility to receive reward points) in exchange for discounted credit of purchasing our products upon conversion of using the reward
points. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately 21,000 and 0.2 million, respectively, in
marketing and promotion expense, and recognized the same amount of product revenue at the time of redemption of the non-spending related
activities reward points by our customers. The decrease in marketing and promotion expenses was primarily driven by our strategic goal
to optimize the promotional activities, enhance our cost effectiveness, and increase profitability in our operations. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses amounted to approximately 0.8 million and 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately 0.4 million or 36.2 . The decrease was primarily attributed to decrease
in salary expenses and professional fee expense of approximately 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively, to promote our operation
effectiveness. 

Research
and development expenses 

Research
and development expense amounted to approximately 47,000 and 82,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, representing
36.2 decrease as we incurred less spending in mobile application or website development. 

Stock-based
compensation expenses 

Stock-based
compensation expenses amounted to 70,000 and 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The stock-based
compensation incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was related to compensation paid to our executive officer as part
of their compensation plan and third party for professional service . 

Other
expense, net 

Other
expense, net, amounted to approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
 representing a decrease of approximately 71,000 which was primarily attributable to decrease of
amortization of debt discount of approximately 239,000 related to our convertible note payable as all of our convertible notes has been
converted during the year ended June 30, 2024, offset by an increased in unrealized loss of approximately 188,000 from marketable securities
we received as service consideration in development of an artificial intelligence powered travel platform. 

Provision
for income taxes 

Provision
for income taxes amounted to approximately 11,391 and 14,925 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
amount was mainly attributable to tax imposed on us from the State of Delaware, as we are required to remit franchise tax to the State
of Delaware on an annual basis. We also were subject to controlled foreign corporations Subpart F income Subpart F tax,
which is a tax primarily on passive income from controlled foreign corporations with a tax rate of 35 . In addition, the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act imposed a global intangible low-taxed income GILTI tax, which is a tax on certain off-shore earnings at an effective
rate of 10.5 for tax years (50 deduction of the current enacted tax rate of 21 with a partial offset for 80 foreign tax credits.
If the foreign tax rate is 13.125 or higher, there will be no U.S. corporate tax after the 80 foreign tax credits are applied. For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our foreign subsidiaries did not generate any income that are subject to Subpart
F tax and GILTI tax. 

41 

Net
losses 

Our
net losses decreased by approximately 1.2 million predominately due to the reasons as discussed above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

In
assessing liquidity, we monitor and analyze cash on-hand and operating expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet working
capital requirements and operating expense obligations. To date, we financed our operations primarily through cash flows from contribution
from stockholders, issuance of convertible notes, related party loans and our completion of initial underwritten public offering. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had approximately 73,000 and 0.2 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalent which
primarily consists of bank deposits, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use. 

On
November 30, 2023, we closed our November 2023 Offering of (i) 26,014,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of 0.10
per share, and (ii) 14,000,000 Pre-Funded Warrants, each with the right to purchase one share of Common Stock, at a public offering price
of 0.0999 per Pre-Funded Warrant. Upon closing of the November 2023 Offering, we received aggregate net proceed of approximately 3.5
million, after deducting underwriting discounts, and non-accountable expense. 

On
March 22, 2024, we have entered into a marketing offering agreement Marketing Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright
 Co., LLC, (the Manager ). Pursuant to the Marketing Offering Agreement, the Company intends to issue and sell through
or to the Manager, as sales agent and / or principal from time to time of the Company s common stock at the Market Offering. As
of September 30, 2024, we have received an aggregated net proceed of approximately 2.9 million, net of broker fee from issuance of 1,678,307
shares of common stock which sell through or to the Manager. 

On
October 10, 2024, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Alumni Capital LP Alumni
Capital ), a Delaware limited partnership. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation to cause
Alumni Capital to purchase up to 6,000,000 the Company s common stock, par value 0.00001 (the Commitment Amount ),
at certain purchase Price during the period beginning on the execution date of the Purchase Agreement and ending on the earlier of (i)
the date on which Alumni Capital has purchased 6,000,000 of our common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or (ii) December 31,
2025. 

Despite
receiving the proceeds from various offerings, management is of the opinion that we will not have sufficient funds to meet the working
capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due starting from one year from the date of this report due to our recurring
loss. Therefore, management has determined there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable
to generate significant revenue, we may be required to curtail or cease our operations. Management is trying to alleviate the going concern
risk through the following sources: 

Equity financing to support
 our working capital; 

Financial support and credit
 guarantee commitments from our related parties. 

However,
there is no guarantee that the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern will be alleviated. 

The
following summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Net cash used in investing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.5 million which includes a remittance of approximately 1.5 million to CLSB
as a collaboration deposit to support CLSB s credit service activities for the Portfolio Clients, 

Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September
30, 2023 was approximately 6,000, which mainly due to purchase of equipment of approximately 6,000 for our operations used. 

Financing

Net
cash provided financing activities the three months ended September , 2024 was approximately 2.5 million, which mainly comprised of
payments of insurance loan and related party loan of approximately 20,000, offset by approximately 2.5 million net proceeds received
from issuance of common stock through our market offering. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 81,000, which mainly comprised
of repayment to related parties, and insurance loan of approximately 81,000. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support
and credit risk support or other benefits. 

Critical
Accounting Estimate 

Our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
We have identified certain accounting estimates that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates
are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Certain accounting estimates are particularly
sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate
may differ significantly from management s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting estimates involve the
most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

43 

The
preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include
the estimated retail price per point and estimated breakage to calculate the revenue recognized in our loyalty program revenue, the useful
lives of property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, provision for estimated credit losses, write-down for estimated obsolescence
or unmarketable inventories, realization of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position, fair value of our stock price to determine
the beneficial conversion feature BCF within the convertible note, fair value of the stock-based compensation, fair value
of the marketable securities and fair value of the warrants issued. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Accounts
receivable, net 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts and do not accrue interest. We offer various
payments terms to customers from cash due on delivery to 90 days based on their credit history. Accounts receivable encompass amounts
due from sales of healthcare products on our ZCITY platform. Starting from July 1, 2023, we adopted ASU No.2016-13 Financial Instruments
 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASC Topic 326 ). We used
a modified retrospective approach, and the adoption does not have an impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Management also periodically evaluates individual customer s financial condition, credit history and the current economic conditions
to make adjustments in the allowance when it is considered necessary. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when all
collection efforts have been exhausted, and recovery potential is deemed remote. Our management reviews historical accounts receivable
collection rates across all aging brackets and has made 100 provision of credit loss for customer balances aged above 120 days for sales
of healthcare products on our ZCITY platform. Our management continuously assesses the reasonableness of the credit loss allowance policy
and updates it as needed. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we recorded 243 and 1,100 of provision for estimated credit
losses, respectively. 

Inventories 

Our
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method.
These costs encompass gift cards or E-voucher pin codes, which are acquired from our suppliers as merchandise goods or
store credit, as well as healthcare products. Management conducts regular comparisons between the cost of inventories and their net realizable
value. If the net realizable value is lower than the cost, an allowance is made for inventory write-down. Ongoing assessments of inventories
are carried out to identify potential write-downs due to estimated obsolescence or unmarketability. This determination is based on the
difference between the inventory costs and the estimated net realizable value, considering forecasts for future demand and market conditions.
Once inventories are written down to the lower of cost or net realizable value, they are not subsequently marked up based on changes
in underlying facts and circumstances. Our management has reviewed the aforementioned factors and has applied a 100 write-down for inventories
aged above 180 days related to our E-voucher and health care products. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no write-downs
for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories were recorded. 

Other
receivables and other current assets, net 

Other receivables and other current assets consist
of prepayment to third parties for cyber security service, director officer liability insurance D O Insurance ),
and other professional fee. Other receivables and other current assets also include refundable advance to third party service provider,
and other deposits. Starting from July 1, 2023 , we had adopted ASC Topic 326 on our other receivables
using the modified retrospective approach. The new credit loss guidance replaces the old model for measuring the allowance for credit
losses with a model that is based on the expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new accounting guidance, we measure credit
losses on its other receivables using the current expected credit loss model under ASC 326. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,
we have provided allowance for credit loss of 233,392 and 212,758, respectively. 

44 

Prepayments 

Prepayments
and deposits are mainly cash deposited or advanced to suppliers for future inventory purchases. This amount is refundable and bears no
interest. For any prepayments determined by management that such advances will not be in receipt of inventories, services or refundable,
we will recognize an allowance account to reserve such balances. Management reviews our prepayments on a regular basis to determine if
the allowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off against allowance for
doubtful accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. Our management continues to evaluate
the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and updates it if necessary. No allowance of prepayments was recorded as of
 September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 . 

Impairment
for long-lived assets 

Long-lived
assets, including property and equipment with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such
as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value
of an asset may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets
are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use
of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment
is identified, we would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach
or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. No impairment for long-lived assets were recorded as of September
30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 . 

Investment
in marketable securities 

Investments
in marketable securities, net, consist of investments in listed shares, which are listed on Nasdaq. Marketable securities are accounted
for under ASC 321 and reported at their readily determinable fair values as quoted by market exchanges with changes in fair value
recorded in other (expense) income in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. All changes
in a marketable security s fair value are reported in earnings as they occur, as such, the sale of a marketable security does not
necessarily give rise to a significant gain or loss. Unrealized gains/(losses) due to fluctuations in fair value are recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Declines in fair value below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary are
recognized as impairments in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For the three months ended September
30, 2024, we recorded an unrealized holding loss on marketable securities of approximately 128,000. In comparison, for the same period
in 2023, we recognized an unrealized holding gain of approximately 60,000. 

Revenue
recognition 

Loyalty
program 

- 
 Performance obligations
 satisfied over time 

Our
ZCITY reward loyalty program allows members to earn points on purchases that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts on future
purchases. When members purchase our product or make purchase with our participated vendor through ZCITY, we allocate the transaction
price between the product or service, and the reward points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point
redemption. The portion allocated to the reward points is initially recorded as contract liability and subsequently recognized as revenue
upon redemption or expiration. 

45 

The
two primary estimates utilized to record the contract liability for reward points earned by members are the estimated retail price per
point and estimated breakage. The estimated retail price per point is based on the actual historical retail prices of product purchased
or service obtained through the redemption of reward points. We estimate breakage of reward points based on historical redemption rates.
We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in retail price per point redeemed, redemption patterns
and other factors. Changes in the retail price per point and redemption rates have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the
contract liability through current period revenue by an amount estimated to represent the retail value of all points previously earned
but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. 

Income
taxes 

Deferred
taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax basis
used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized
or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited
or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. 

An
uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained
in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that
is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test,
no tax benefit is recorded. 

Stock-based
compensation 

We
account for stock-based compensation awards to officers in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ,
which requires that stock-based payment transactions with employees be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instrument
issued and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period. In June 2024, we executed executive employment agreements Employment Agreements with three individuals, appointing them as the Company s executive officers. Under the terms
of the Employment Agreements, each executive officer is entitled to receive a predetermined monetary value of the Company s common
stock as annual compensation for the first year, with stock compensation for subsequent years contingent upon performance. The stock
compensation is prorated on a monthly basis and is subject to the restrictions of Securities Act Rule 144. The fair value of the stock-based
compensation which included common stock issued were equivalent to the predetermined monetary value. For the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, we have incurred stock-based compensation from our officer amounted to 70,000 and 0, respectively based on the vesting
schedule from the Employment Agreement. 

Convertible
notes 

We
evaluate our convertible notes to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives. The
result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each reporting period
and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the
statements of operations as other income or expense. 

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

If
the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provide for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this
feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature. A BCF is recorded by us as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20
 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related
to the BCF, and we amortize the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt. 

Warrants 

For
the year ended June 30, 2024, 14,000,000 Pre-Funded Warrants were issued in connection with the November 2023 Offering. The Pre-Funded
Warrants are classified as a component of permanent stockholders equity within additional paid-in capital and were recorded at
the issuance date using a relative fair value allocation method. We valued the Pre-Funded Warrants at issuance concluding the purchase
price approximated the fair value and allocated net proceeds from the purchase proportionately to the common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants,
of which 1,398,600 was allocated to the Pre-Funded Warrants and recorded as a component of additional paid in capital.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not, in design and operation, effective as of September
30, 2024 at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below: 

Inadequate U.S. GAAP expertise.
 The current accounting staff is inexperienced in applying U.S. GAAP standard as they are primarily engaged in ensuring compliance
 with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS accounting and reporting requirement for our consolidated operating
 entities, and thus require substantial training. The current staff s accounting skills and understanding as to how to fulfill
 the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting, including subsidiary financial statements consolidation, are inadequate; 

Inadequate
 internal audit function. We lack of a functional internal audit department or personnel that monitors the consistencies of the preventive
 internal control procedures and lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that our policies and
 procedures have been carried out as planned; 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Following
the identification of the material weaknesses, we plan to take remedial measures including: 

hiring more qualified accounting
 personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function
 and to set up a financial and system control framework; 

implementing regular and
 continuous U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our accounting and financial reporting personnel; 

establishing internal audit
 function by engaging an external consulting firm to assist us with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance requirements
 and improvement of overall internal control; and 

strengthening corporate
 governance. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1A. RISK FACTORS.
