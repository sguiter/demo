costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, reducing operating spend, and future issuances of equity and debt securities,

financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets
and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 

The consolidated financial statements
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.

and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Company Overview 

SATIVUS TECH CORP. (formerly SEEDO CORP.) (the
 Company , Our or We was formed on January 16, 2015, under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Prior to July 2020, we were involved in producing a plant growing device managed and controlled by an artificial intelligent algorithm,
allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables effortlessly from seed to plant, while providing optimal conditions to assure
premium quality produce year-round. However, due to financial and operational difficulties and during 2020, we ceased these operations
and on July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the New
Subsidiary ), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron and other vegetables. On November 5,
2020, the New Subsidiary changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd. (or Saffron Tech ). As of the date of this report, and following
various financings in Saffron Tech, the Company owns 54 of Saffron Tech. 

2 

The Company, through Saffron Tech, is focusing
on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products, among others, in the fields of exotic plants and mushrooms.
Saffron Tech plans to roll out its proof of concept in the coming months. This technology will provide turnkey automated growing containers
for high-quality, high-yield saffron all year round. The Company is in advanced stages of developing and testing a fully automated and
remotely managed system for growing high-quality, high-yield saffron anywhere and anytime. 

It is also environmentally friendly, using economic
levels of water, space, fertilizer, and energy. Accounting to the Company s calculations, we believe that the controlled indoor
growing area will produce ten times more yield compared to the same land area using traditional methods. The sealed environment eliminates
the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides, producing a clean and safe product that is easy to control from anywhere. The Company s
solution is easily scalable and pre-designed to quickly grow operations. 

Saffron is used in many industries, such as the
food industry, particularly by famous chefs and Michelin starred restaurants, the natural cosmetics industry and the food supplements
industry and as a dye in the textile industry. Medicinal claims as an anti-depressant, antioxidant, and antiseptic are constantly increasing. 

On January 6, 2022, the Company announced that
its subsidiary, Saffron Tech, has planted approximately 25,000 Saffron bulbs in fields in the Golan Heights, in Norther Israel. The plantation
is being managed in conjunction with the Shamir Research Institute. 

On April 4, 2022, the Company announced that Mr.
Moshe Bar Siman Tov and Mrs. Iris Tova Ginsburg have resigned from the Board of Directors of the Company, and immediately appointed
Mrs. Tal Wilk-Glazer to its Board of Directors and as CEO of the Company. 

In April 2022, Saffron Tech announced its new
state-of-the-art indoor research and development center is operational. From April 2022, through to December 2022, Saffron Tech successfully
completed three Saffron cultivation cycles using vertical farming technology, while traditional agriculture only produces one harvest
of saffron per year. 

On August 30, 2022, Saffron Tech, announced its
intention to raise up to 5 million New Israeli Shekels NIS (approximately 1.5 million) at a pre-money valuation of NIS
32.5 million (approximately 10 million) through the Israeli crowdfunding platform Pipelbiz 2022 Crowd Funding Round ).
Assuming the maximum amount is raised, the Company will own approximately 61 of Saffron Tech. The 2022 Crowd Funding Round was closed
on December 1, 2022, having raised 3.8 million NIS (approximately 1.3 million). Fundraising expenses accumulated to 152 and the net
amount raised through Pipelbiz was 1.15 million. Saffron Tech also raised 1.15 million NIS (approximately 328 thousand) through the
issuance of SAFEs. The SAFEs are convertible at a 20 discount to the current crowdfunding round. Sativus Tech s interest in Saffron
Tech now totals 67.5 post-raise. All SAFEs were converted before December 31, 2022. Saffron Tech continued to raise funds through Pipelbiz
under the same pre-money valuation from December 2022 through to January 2023, via another crowdfunding round 2023 Crowd Funding
Round which closed on February 5, 2023, having raised another 1.1 million NIS (approximately 314 thousand). 

On March 1, 2023, Saffron Tech entered into an
investment agreement with Korean-based company, Dreamtech Co Ltd Dreamtech ), a leading provider and manufacturer
of tech components for innovative products including advanced mobile and medical devices. Under this new agreement, Dreamtech will fund
an initial investment of 1 million followed by an additional 1 million upon a successful cultivation of saffron in Korea. Saffron Tech
aims to be the first company to create a large-scale production of saffron using vertical farming technology to meet the growing demand
of the spice for use in beauty, wellness, and pharmaceutical applications. Sativus Tech s interest in Saffron Tech now totals 59 
post-raise.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP for interim financial statement presentation and in accordance with Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required in annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed financial statements contain
all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations
and cash flows. The results of operations presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim
period or for the entire year. 

These unaudited condensed financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our December 31, 2022, annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K, filed with
the SEC on April 1 st , 2024. 

Going Concern 

Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet
our current operating and capital expenses, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the condensed
consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a
going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure
by our independent auditors. 

Our unaudited condensed financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of
business. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or
to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
become due. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raise substantial doubt that we will
be able to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and
classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance
that our operations will be profitable. Our continued existence and plans for future growth depend on our ability to obtain the additional
capital necessary to operate either through the generation of revenue or the issuance of additional debt or equity. 

Financing 

We will require additional financing to implement
our business plan, which may include joint venture projects and debt or equity financings. The nature of this enterprise and constraint
of positive cash flow places debt financing beyond the credit-worthiness required by most banks or typical investors of corporate debt
until such time as an economically viable profits and losses can be demonstrated. Therefore, any debt financing of our activities may
be costly and result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. 

Future financing through equity investments is
likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more
favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, and the issuance of warrants
or other derivative securities, which may have additional dilutive effects. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future
capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and other costs. We may also be required to recognize
non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact
our financial condition. 

Our ability to obtain needed financing may be
impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in the Agro-tech industry, which could impact the availability
or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenue from
operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required
to cease operations. 

4 

There is no assurance that we will be able to
obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future financing. If we are
unable to secure additional funding, we may cease or suspend operations. We have no plans, arrangements or contingencies in place in the
event that we cease operations.

operations from the initial contribution of our majority shareholder and by raising equity and convertible loans.

we had cash flow from investing activities of 345 thousand compared to a negative cash flow from investing activities of 774 thousand
