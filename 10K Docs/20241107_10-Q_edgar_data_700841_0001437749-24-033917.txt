RCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)

 Engineering: 
 Time and Material 
 Fixed Fee 
 Total Engineering 
 
 Life Sciences and Information Technology: 
 Time and Material 
 Permanent Placement Services 
 Fixed Fee 
 Total Life Sciences and Information Technology 

Time and Material 
 
 The Company s Health Care segment predominantly recognizes revenue through time and material work while its Engineering and Life Sciences and Information Technology segments recognize revenue through both time and material and fixed fee work. The Company s time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates. 
 
 Fixed Fee 
 
 From time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company s fixed fee purchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time, amounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, some contracts contain Performance Fees (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized. 
 
 Permanent Placement Services 
 
 The Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are typically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company s client. The Company guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not retained for the 90 -day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a replacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An allowance for refunds, based upon the Company s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements. 
 
 Deferred Revenue 
 
 There was million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2024. Deferred revenue was million as of December 30, 2023. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet, although this is an infrequent occurrence. For the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company did not recognize any revenue included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period. For the thirteen weeks that ended on September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of million that was included in the deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period. 

Concentration 
 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company had customers exceed 10 of consolidated revenue, representing and of consolidated revenue, respectively. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company had customer exceed 10 of consolidated revenue, representing of consolidated revenue. In both periods presented, the customers are included in the Company s Specialty Health Care segment. 

Unbilled 
 Work-in-progress 
 Provision for credit losses 
 
 Accounts receivable, net 

Unbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the balance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the Company contractually invoices at future dates. 
 
 From time to time, the Company s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things, construction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may purchase equipment on behalf of the Company s customer or engage subcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project value; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent under the provisions of FASB ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and therefore recognizes revenue on a net-basis. The Company records revenue on a net basis on relevant engineering and construction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those situations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned. 
 
 Under the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the corresponding payment from the Company s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of the subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a transit account receivable and transit account payable, as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and generally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit account payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to pay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company s transit accounts payable generally exceeds the Company s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and spreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit accounts receivable was million and related transit accounts payable was million, for a net payable of million, as of September 28, 2024. The transit accounts receivable was million and related transit accounts payable was million, for a net payable of million, as of December 30, 2023.

The Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets. The Company wrote off fully depreciated and amortized assets of and during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. 

Thereafter 
 Estimated future contingent consideration payments 

Future Contingent Payments (Continued) 
 
 For acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional consideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future earn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial results by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These liabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Estimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of September 28, 2024. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3 with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net. 
 
 Potential future contingent payments for acquisitions after September 28, 2024 are capped at a cumulative maximum of million. The Company did not pay contingent consideration during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and paid million of contingent consideration during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The contingent consideration paid in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 included million of the Company's common stock. 

million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), has no sub-limit for letters of credit, and expires on April 24, 2026. 
 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), plus applicable margin or (ii) the agent bank s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were and , respectively. 
 
 All borrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain collateralized with substantially all of the Company s assets, as well as the capital stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Borrowings under the line of credit as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 for million and million, respectively. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of million and million, respectively. 

Dilutive effect of outstanding restricted share awards 
 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 

For all periods presented, there were no anti-dilutive shares included in the calculation of common stock equivalents as there were no stock options outstanding. 

Unissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes: 

Performance-based restricted stock awards outstanding 
 Future grants of options or shares 
 Shares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 
 
 Total 

years of issuance. The Company may also issue immediately vested equity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based awards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The Company expenses performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and the associated awards are therefore likely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are also expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed, depending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later determined to be unlikely to vest or forfeited. Discussion of share and share-based awards herein references awards of shares and share units.

These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based awards granted in future periods or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company s forfeiture rate. 

Incentive Share-Based Plans 
 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 
 The Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment qualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through payroll deductions at the lower of of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the offering period. The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions for up to of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal year of shares. 
 
 In fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional shares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional shares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be shares. In fiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional shares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030. 
 
 The Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company s first two fiscal quarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent offering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. The number of shares issued on July 1, 2024 the first business day following the previous offering period) was . As of September 28, 2024, there were shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Compensation expense, representing the discount to the quoted market price, for the Purchase Plan for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. 

2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan) 
 
 The 2014 Plan, approved by the Company s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance of up to shares of the Company s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2022, the Company amended, or amended and restated, the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional , and shares, respectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan is shares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant. 
 
 All stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee s stock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of September 28, 2024, there were accrued dividends. Dividends for stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, under the 2014 Plan, time-based shares were outstanding, performance-based restricted stock awards were outstanding and shares were available for awards. 
 
 The intrinsic value of all equity grants for the fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively. These amounts are based on the equity price on the last trading day in the period presented. 
 
 Time-Based Restricted Stock Awards

 The following summarizes the activity in the performance-based restricted stock awards during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024: 

Granted 
 Vested 
 Forfeited or expired 
 Outstanding non-vested at September 28, 2024 

As of September 28, 2024, there were two outstanding grants for performance-based restricted stock awards issued to Bradley Vizi, the Company s Chief Executive Officer. In February 2024, the Company issued a performance-based restricted stock unit grant of a maximum of shares, the shares of which may vest over four years in equal annual installments of a maximum of shares (the February 2024 Performance Grant). As of September 28, 2024, the Company estimates that shares under the February 2024 Performance Grant will be earned and issued in fiscal 2025. In March 2024, the Company issued a performance-based restricted stock unit grant of a maximum of shares (the March 2024 Performance Grant) that potentially vests in fiscal 2025. As of September 28, 2024, the Company estimates that zero shares under the March 2024 Performance Grant will be earned and issued. 
 
 The Company assesses at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and recognizes the expense when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement date, the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock awards deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed. 
 
 Share-based compensation for performance-based equity agreement was million and million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation for performance-based equity agreement was million and million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

The Company may enter into a Rule 10b5 - 1 trading plan to effect a portion of the authorized purchases if the criteria set forth in the plan are met. Such a plan would enable the Company to repurchase its shares during periods outside of its normal trading windows when the Company typically would not be active in the market.

million of income tax expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was as compared to for the comparable prior-year period. The effective income tax rates for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, were approximately , and in the United States, Canada and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and European pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The comparable prior-year period estimated income tax rates were , and in the United States, Canada and Europe, respectively. 
 
 Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company. The actual 2024 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based awards. 

million for asserted claims. 
 
 In April 2022, a client of the Company s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount no higher than million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of million and maximum coverage of million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved 0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to 3.3 million or that liability over 0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance. 
 
 The Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Overview 
 
 RCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of economic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company s financial performance. 
 
 The Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven record of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to optimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong vertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform. 
 
 The Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business processes to compete in today s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact on spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions. 
 
 Nonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences, information technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they can maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Although working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support increasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a demand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes. 
 
 The Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon fixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also realizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company s consultants based upon their skill level, experience and the type of work performed. 
 
 The majority of the Company s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more complex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. The Company recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Overview (Continued) 
 
 Costs of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and employees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating activities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company s corporate marketing, administrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these expenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the purpose of segment financial reporting. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes and accrued bonuses. The various estimates and assumptions taken into account include: 

The provision for expected credit losses is determined based on the current and future financial condition of our clients with outstanding accounts receivable. The provision is updated when a change in a client s financial condition is identified. 

When determining whether an impairment of goodwill or of an intangible asset is indicated with respect to an acquired business, we take into account the financial condition of those of our three segments to which the acquired business relates. 

The market price of the Company stock at the end of each reporting period is used to value the Company s stock options and restricted stock awards. The market price fluctuates each reporting period and the disclosures are updated to reflect the change in market price. 

The Company maintains a self funded health and welfare plan. Claims history is reviewed to estimate claims incurred but not yet paid to determine the adequacy of the health and welfare accrual. 

Taxable income of the Company is used in determining an accurate income tax expense / accrual 

Bonus accruals are reviewed and adjusted on a regular basis depending on the profitability of the Company and individual bonus agreements. 

A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or complex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 A discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 12, New Accounting Standards and Updates from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Forward-looking Information 
 
 The Company s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences and information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company s operating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and endemic can have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy. 
 
 Additionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company s future earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing. 
 
 The consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company competes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company s service lines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.

Thirteen Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 (Continued) 
 
 Other Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net increased by 0.5 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase in interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing and increased interest rates. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company recognized 1.0 million of income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 0.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 27.1 as compared to 10.4 for the comparable prior-year period. The effective fiscal 2024 income tax rates as of September 28, 2024, were approximately 28.3 , 26.2 and 13.1 in the United States, Canada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete permanent differences affecting any period presented. The primary reason for the increase in the consolidated effective rate in the current period was due to a permanent tax difference associated with the tax deduction for equity grants in the United States that vested during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company. The actual 2024 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based awards.

 Specialty Health Care revenue of 26.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, increased 6.7 , or 1.6 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue was driven by the Company s school clients, offset by a decrease in revenue from the Company s non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, was 20.2 million as compared to 17.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school clients for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, was 6.4 million as compared to 7.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in non-school revenue was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue from a large long-term care group where the Company deliberately reduced services, which generated 0.7 million in the current period as compared to 1.9 million in the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased by 11.1 , or 0.8 million, to 8.3 million as compared to 7.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased due to increases in revenue and gross profit margin. Gross profit margin for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, increased to 31.2 compared to 30.0 for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to a greater mix shift to school services as opposed to non-school services. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of 1.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 1.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the increase in operating income was the increase in gross profit, offset by an increase to SGA expense to 6.5 million compared to 6.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. SGA expense increased primarily due to sales and recruiting infrastructure investments expected to generate higher growth rates for the 2024/2025 school year.

 Engineering 
 
 Engineering revenue of 24.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, increased 7.6 , or 1.7 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue comprised the following: an increase in Energy Services revenue of 3.0 million, offset by decreases in Aerospace revenue of 0.1 million and Industrial Processing revenue of 1.2 million. Aerospace revenue decreased primarily due to a contract reduction for the Company s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing revenue was mainly due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross profit increased by 5.1 , or 0.3 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased because of the increase in revenue, offset by a decrease in gross profit margin. The gross profit margin of 24.4 for the current period decreased from 25.0 for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower utilization and mix shift associated with project revenue from the Energy Services group. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of 1.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 1.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. Operating income increased due to the increase in gross profit and a negligible decrease in SGA expense. 
 
 Life Sciences and Information Technology 
 
 Life Sciences and Information Technology revenue of 9.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, decreased by 9.9 , or 1.0 million, compared to 10.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was derived from the Company s legacy IT staffing business of 1.0 million in the current period versus 1.3 million in the comparable prior year period and normal fluctuations in other business lines. Gross profit of 3.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, decreased 13.1 , or 0.5 million, compared to 4.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, was 38.0 as compared to 39.4 for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes the gross profit margin decrease to fluctuations in high margin project work. The Company also believes the gross margin for the current period is a more normalized rate. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment experienced operating income of 1.4 million compared to 1.8 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit, offset by a decrease in SGA expense. SGA expense decreased to 2.2 million compared to 2.4 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to normal fluctuations.

Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 (Continued) 
 
 Costs Associated with Potential Stock Issuance. In the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the Registration Statement) with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of up to 100.0 million of various securities. The Company also entered an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement under which the Company may sell, under the Registration Statement, up to 50.0 million worth of shares of the Company s common stock. The Company incurred total expenses of 259 related to these transactions. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Assets. On July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its Pickering and Kincardine offices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada Power Systems and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The two Canada Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company s Engineering segment. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a discrete gain on the sale of these assets and liabilities of 0.4 million due to the final collection of escrow funds from the transaction. 
 
 Other Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net increased by 0.7 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase in interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing and increased interest rates. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . The Company recognized 4.0 million of income tax expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 3.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 27.5 as compared to 21.9 for the comparable prior-year period. The effective fiscal 2024 income tax rates as of September 28, 2024, were approximately 28.3 , 26.2 and 13.1 in the United States, Canada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete permanent differences affecting any period presented. The primary reason for the increase in the consolidated effective rate in the current period was due to a permanent tax difference associated with the tax deduction for equity grants in the United States that vested during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company. The actual 2024 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based awards.

 Specialty Health Care 
 
 Specialty Health Care revenue of 101.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, increased 2.1 , or 2.1 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue was driven by the Company s school clients, offset by a decrease in revenue from the Company s non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, was 82.9 million as compared to 73.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school clients for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, was 18.8 million as compared to 26.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in non-school revenue was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue from a large long-term care group where the Company deliberately reduced services, which generated 2.7 million in the current period as compared to 8.0 million in the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased by 3.7 , or 1.1 million, to 30.0 million as compared to 28.9 million in the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased due to an increase in revenue and gross profit margin. Gross profit margin for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, increased to 29.5 compared to 29.1 for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to a greater mix shift to school services as opposed to non-school services, offset by increased unemployment tax rates in New York. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of 8.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 9.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was an increase in SGA expenses to 21.3 million compared to 19.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. SGA expense increased primarily due to sales and recruiting infrastructure investments expected to generate higher growth rates for the 2024/2025 school year.

 Engineering 
 
 Engineering revenue of 70.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, increased 13.3 , or 8.2 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue comprised the following: an increase in Energy Services revenue of 11.6 million, offset by decreases in Aerospace revenue of 1.6 million and Industrial Processing revenue of 1.8 million. Aerospace revenue decreased primarily due to a contract reduction for the Company s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing revenue was mainly due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross profit increased by 20.0 , or 2.9 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased because of the increase in revenue, augmented by an increase in gross profit margin. The gross profit margin of 24.7 for the current period increased from 23.4 for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to better utilization, associated with higher revenue and favorable project revenue from the Energy Services group. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of 4.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 1.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. Operating income increased due to the increase in gross profit and a small decrease of 0.1 million in SGA expense. The Engineering segment s SGA expense of 12.5 million decreased from 12.6 million, primarily due to deliberate reductions to gain better efficiency. 
 
 Life Sciences and Information Technology 
 
 Life Sciences and Information Technology revenue of 29.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, decreased 3.5 , or 1.1 million, compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit of 10.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, decreased 7.0 , or 0.8 million, compared to 11.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, was 36.6 as compared to 38.0 for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes the gross profit margin decrease to fluctuations in high margin project work. The Company also believes the gross margin for the current period is a more normalized rate. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment experienced operating income of 3.6 million compared to 4.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit, and an increase in SGA expense. SGA expense increased to 7.0 million compared to 6.9 million in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to normal fluctuations.

Operating Activities 
 
 Operating activities provided 7.8 million of cash for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to providing 27.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. The major components of cash provided by operating activities in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and the comparable prior-year period are as follows: net income, and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs, and deferred revenue. 
 
 For the thirty-nine weeks that ended September 28, 2024, the Company experienced a net income of 10.5 million compared to 11.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, used 5.2 million of cash compared to using 6.7 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company primarily attributes this increase in accounts receivables for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, to three factors: 1) several large, multiyear EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) projects with increasing retainage and normal fluctuations in invoicing and collections, 2) a purchase order with the Company's largest school client that was extinguished in fiscal 2023, and 3) a formerly large long-term care group where the Company deliberately reduced services due to slow paying of invoices. The Company's EPC accounts receivable balance was 9.1 million as of September 28, 2024, compared to 1.3 million as of December 30, 2024. The balance is expected to reduce significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and to fluctuate after that. The Company had a receivable balance of 4.2 million for nursing services to its largest school client for the school year ended June 2024. If not for the extinguished purchase order, these invoices are typically fully paid by the end of the following September. The Company expects to collect substantially all of this receivable by the end of fiscal 2024. The Company estimates that the long-term care group's receivable balance exceeded a normalized balance of 3.4 million. The Company has been given assurance by its client that substantially all of the excess balance will be paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 

While highly variable, the Company s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company s transit accounts receivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of 21.9 million as of September 28, 2024 and a net payable of 22.2 million as of December 30, 2023, using 0.3 million of cash during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of 28.9 million as of September 30, 2023 and a net payable of 6.5 million as of December 31, 2022, providing 22.4 million of cash during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to net transit payable as of September 28, 2024 was due to normal fluctuations associated with several large, multiyear EPC projects. In a typical EPC contract, the Company receives significant cash upfront to fund equipment procurement and construction subcontractors throughout the project.

 Operating Activities (Continued) 
 
 Prepaid expenses and other current assets used cash of 0.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to using 0.7 million of cash for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes changes to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business. Since certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year, prepaid expenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during the first three quarters of the following fiscal year. 
 
 An decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of 0.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to using 1.8 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes these changes to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business. 
 
 Changes in accrued payroll and related costs provided 0.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 as compared to providing 1.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. There are four primary factors that generally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and related costs is the Company s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two weeks and normally has thirty-nine weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the normal course of business; and 4) most of the Company s senior management participate in annual incentive plans and while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent they are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive plan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The Company s last major payroll for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was paid on September 27, 2024. 
 
 The Company s deferred revenue balance as of September 28, 2024 was 2.0 million, compared to 1.9 million as of December 30, 2023, providing cash from operations of 0.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024. The increase was associated with upfront payments for future labor associated with the Company s EPC contracts. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Investing activities used 1.6 million for the purchase of property and equipment in the current period as compared to using 0.9 million in the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the increase was the continued implementation of the Company s new ERP software system. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Financing activities used 9.1 million of cash for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to using 26.6 million in the comparable prior-year period.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued) 
 
 Financing Activities (Continued) 
 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) (which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 6.8 and 6.4 , respectively. 
 
 All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Borrowings under the line of credit as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were 30.5 million and 30.8 million, respectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 for 7.0 million and 2.0 million, respectively. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of 7.5 million and 12.1 million, respectively. 
 
 In addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of shares of common stock under its at the market issuance program (the ATM Program established under its March 2024 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the Agent ). The ATM Program allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 50.0 million from time to time through the Agent. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the ATM Program. 
 
 Current Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, and meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs through cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The Company believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes that it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued) 
 
 Current Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued) 
 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources as of September 28, 2024, included accounts receivable and total current asset balances of 75.9 million and 90.5 million, respectively. Current liabilities were 55.6 million as of September 28, 2024 and were exceeded by total current assets by 34.9 million. 
 
 The Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to provide daily liquidity for the Company s financial operations. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 The Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes. Funding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations. 
 
 The Company s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through strategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase however, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such opportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to the Company s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed. 
 
 The Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of September 28, 2024, where the Company believes it has a probability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has accrued 2.5 million for asserted claims. 
 
 In April 2022, a client of the Company s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount no higher than 3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of 0.5 million and maximum coverage of 5.0 million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved 0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to 3.3 million or that liability over 0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued) 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) 
 
 The Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance. 
 
 The Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not previously undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is currently implementing an upgrade of its current system, which went live in April 2024. 
 
 The Company s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 The Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates through October 2029. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors. 
 
 Maturities of lease liabilities are as follows:

Future Contingent Payments 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC, and 2) effective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future contingent payments at September 28, 2024 as follows:

Estimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of September 28, 2024. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company s investment portfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of September 28, 2024, the Company s investments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company s variable-rate line of credit balances during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, if the interest rate on the Company s variable-rate line of credit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0 higher, the Company s interest expense on an annualized basis would have increased by 0.3 million. The Company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. As previously disclosed under Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, we identified deficiencies described below that existed as of December 30, 2023, and continued to exist at September 28, 2024. Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule(s) 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 28, 2024, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Management identified the following control deficiencies that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023. The Company did not design and maintain information technology controls relevant to preparing its financial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to the SAP ERP and General Ledger and (ii) user access controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user access to financial applications, programs, and data. As a result, there continues to be a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 This material weakness did not result in a misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. 

49

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED) 

Planned Material Weakness Remediation Activities 
 
 To address these material weaknesses, we have commenced actions to formalize the Company's framework and policies to maintain evidence in the operation of control procedures and improve our IT general controls. 
 
 Remaining remediation efforts related to the above-identified material weaknesses include: 

During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, using its current system development lifecycle controls as a framework, the Company installed a new General Ledger system, SAP byDesign, with enhanced functionality and internal control capabilities; 

Expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control activities, including information technology general controls, through hiring and use of third-party consultants and specialists; 

Assess segregation of duties within the GL and revenue system applications, including role design and process transformation, and implement a quarterly user access review to appropriately mitigate significant risks associated with conflicting responsibilities in financial systems; 

Perform additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls, and monitoring activities related to automated processes, systems, and ITGCs related to financial reporting. 

We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to remediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. The implementation of these remediation efforts is in progress, may require additional expenditures to implement, and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and as a result, the timing of when we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses fully is uncertain. We may also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which may necessitate further implementation and evaluation time. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
