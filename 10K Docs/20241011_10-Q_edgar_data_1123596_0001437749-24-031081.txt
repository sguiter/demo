franchise units and licensed units in operation in states. There are units under development. The Company additionally derives income from the sale of its trademark bagels, muffins and coffee through nontraditional channels of distribution including under licensing agreements. 

The BAB franchised brand consists of units operating as Big Apple Bagels , featuring daily baked bagels, flavored cream cheeses, premium coffees, gourmet bagel sandwiches and other related products. BAB units are primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Western United States. The MFM brand consists of units operating as My Favorite Muffin Gourmet Muffin Bakery MFM Bakery ), featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins and coffees and units operating as My Favorite Muffin Your All-Day Bakery Caf MFM Cafe featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products. The SweetDuet is a branded self-serve frozen yogurt that can be added as an additional brand in a BAB location. Although the Company doesn't actively market Brewster's stand-alone franchises, Brewster's coffee products are sold in most franchised units. 

The Company is leveraging on the natural synergy of distributing muffin products in existing BAB units and, alternatively, bagel products and Brewster's Coffee in existing MFM units. The Company expects to continue to realize efficiencies in servicing the combined base of BAB and MFM franchisees. 

The Company has a minority interest in Athletes HQ Systems, Inc. AHQ ). AHQ franchises indoor baseball and softball practice and coaching facilities with knowledgeable instructors. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations; nevertheless, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements and the notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023 which was filed February 26, 2024. In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the unaudited interim period presented include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the results of such interim period and the financial position as of the end of said period. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. 

The Company considers its portfolio segments to be the following: 

Accounts Receivable (Franchise-Related ): Most of the Company s short-term receivables due from franchisees are derived from royalty, advertising and other franchise-related fees. 

Notes Receivable : Notes receivable balances primarily relate to the conversion of (1) certain past due franchisee accounts receivable or (2) early franchise termination fees, to notes receivable. These notes are usually not collateralized. A significant portion of these notes have specific reserves recorded against them amounting to as of August 31, 2024. 

Leases Receivable : Leases receivable consist of a single equipment lease receivable at August 31, 2024. The Company purchased equipment and leased the equipment to a franchisee. The equipment lease is collateralized by the equipment. The outstanding balance of the lease receivable is estimated to equate to the fair value of the equipment collateralizing the lease contracts, and is stated net of the unamortized interest income of at August 31, 2024. 

Accounts Receivables (Vendor Related) : Receivables due from vendors and distributors consist of royalty receivables related to the sale of certain food products to franchisees through the Company s network of suppliers and distributors and are included as part of Accounts Receivable. 

Receivable balances by portfolio segment as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023 are as follows: 

Accounts Receivable (Vendor Related) 

Notes Receivable 

Lease Receivable, Net of Unamortized Interest 

Less: Allowance for Credit Losses 

Total Receivables 

Less: Current Portion 

Long-Term Receivables 

The Company's internal credit quality indicators for all portfolio segments primarily consider delinquency. Current and collateralized lease receivables have an internal risk rating of Grade I. The Company does not currently have any uncollateralized lease receivables. Past due lease receivables would be assigned an internal risk rating of Grade II-IV, depending on significance of delinquency. For uncollateralized notes receivable, the Company also considers the status of the franchisee note holder and the term of the note. Notes receivable from current franchisees are considered to have an elevated risk of credit loss based on their common origination from past due franchise accounts receivable but have some indication of collectability given ongoing operations (Internal Grade II). Notes receivable due from payers who no longer have an operating franchise are considered to have a high likelihood of credit loss (Internal Grade III). That likelihood increases if the note is outstanding for longer than one year (Internal Grade IV). At August 31, 2024, all notes receivable were due from former franchisees and had an original term over one year. 

Changes in the allowance for credit losses during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 were as follows:

years. Subject to the Company s approval, a franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration. If approved, a franchisee may transfer a franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a transfer fee is typically paid by the current owner which then terminates that franchise agreement. A franchise agreement is signed with the new franchisee with no franchise fee required. If a contract is terminated prior to its term, it is a breach of contract and a penalty is assessed based on a formula reviewed and approved by management. Revenue generated from a contract breach is termed settlement income by the Company and included in licensing fees and other income. 

Under the terms of our franchise agreements, the Company typically promises to provide franchise rights, pre-opening services such as blueprints, operational materials, planning and functional training courses, and ongoing services, such as management of the marketing fund. The Company considers certain pre-opening activities and the franchise rights and related ongoing services to represent two separate performance obligations. The franchise fee revenue has been allocated to the two separate performance obligations using a residual approach. The Company has estimated the value of performance obligations related to certain pre-opening activities deemed to be distinct based on cost plus an applicable margin, and assigned the remaining amount of the initial franchise fee to the franchise rights and ongoing services. Revenue allocated to preopening activities is recognized when (or as) these services are performed. Revenue allocated to franchise rights and ongoing services is deferred until the store opens, and recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the agreement, as this ensures that revenue recognition aligns with the customer s access to the franchise right. 

Royalty fees from franchised stores represent a fee on net retail and wholesale sales of franchised units. Royalty revenues are recognized on an accrual basis using actual franchise receipts. Generally, franchisees report and remit royalties on a weekly basis. The majority of month-end receipts are recorded on an accrual basis based on actual numbers from reports received from franchisees shortly after the month-end. Estimates are utilized in certain instances where actual numbers have not been received and such estimates are based on the average of the last 10 weeks actual reported sales. 

Royalty revenue is recognized during the respective franchise agreement based on the royalties earned each period as the underlying franchise store sales occur. 

There are two items involving revenue recognition of contracts that require us to make subjective judgments: the determination of which performance obligations are distinct within the context of the overall contract and the estimated stand-alone selling price of each obligation. In instances where our contract includes significant customization or modification services, the customization and modification services are generally combined and recorded as one distinct performance obligation. 

Gift Card Breakage Revenue 

The Company sells gift cards to its customers in its retail stores and through its Corporate office. The Company s gift cards do not have an expiration date and are not redeemable for cash except where required by law. Revenue from gift cards is recognized upon redemption in exchange for product and reported within franchisee store revenue and the royalty and marketing fees are paid and shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Until redemption, outstanding customer balances are recorded as a liability. An obligation is recorded at the time of sale of the gift card and it is included in accrued expenses on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The liability is reduced when the gift cards are redeemed by a franchise. Although there are no expiration dates for our gift cards, based on our analysis of historical gift card redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote, which is referred to as breakage. The Company recognizes gift card breakage proportional to actual gift card redemptions on a quarterly basis and the corresponding revenue is included in licensing fees and other revenue. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the breakage rate and will be reassessed each quarter. 

Nontraditional and rebate revenue 

As part of the Company s franchise agreements, the franchisee purchases products and supplies from designated vendors. The Company may receive various fees and rebates from the vendors and distributors on product purchases by franchisees. In addition, the Company may collect various initial fees, and those fees are classified as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and straight lined over the life of the contract as deferred revenue in the balance sheet. The Company does not possess control of the products prior to their transfer to the franchisee and products are delivered to franchisees directly from the vendor or their distributors. The Company recognizes the rebates as franchisees purchase products and supplies from vendors or distributors and recognizes the initial fees over the contract life and the fees are reported as licensing fees and other income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Marketing Fund 

Franchise agreements require the franchisee to pay continuing marketing fees on a weekly basis, based on a percentage of franchisee sales. Marketing fees are not paid on franchise wholesale sales. The balance sheet includes marketing fund cash, which is the restricted cash, accounts receivable and unexpended marketing fund contributions. Although the marketing fees are not separate performance obligations distinct from the underlying franchise right, the Company acts as the principal as it is primarily responsible for the fulfillment and control of the marketing services. As a result, the Company records marketing fees in revenues and related marketing fund expenditures in expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company historically presented the net activities of the marketing fund within the balance sheet in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. While this reclassification impacts the gross amount of reported revenue and expenses the amounts will be offsetting, and there is no impact on net income.

The amendment includes a ten-month rent abatement over the lease term, specifically defined in the agreement, and tenant allowance in the amount of . The tenant allowance is to be applied evenly to the 62 months that were not abated. The renewal option has not been included in the measurement of the lease liability.

On May 6, 2013, the Board authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the common stock of the Company to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 13, 2013. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of per one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. The complete terms of the Rights are set forth in a Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated May 6, 2013, between the Company and IST Shareholder Services, as rights agent. 

The Board adopted the Rights Agreement to protect stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. In general terms, it works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group, other than exempt person as defined in the agreement, that acquires (or in the case of certain institutional investors who report their holdings on Schedule 13G) or more of the Common Shares without the approval of the Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the Rights may be to render more difficult a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving the Company that is not approved by the Board. However, neither the Rights Agreement nor the Rights should interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by the Board. 

Full details about the Rights Plan are contained in a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2013. 

On June 18, 2014 an amendment to the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement was filed appointing American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC as successor to Illinois Stock Transfer Company. All original rights and provisions remain unchanged. On August 18, 2015 an amendment was filed to the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement changing the final expiration date to mean the fifth anniversary of the date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On May 22, 2017 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the seventh anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On February 22, 2019 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the ninth anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On March 4, 2021 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the eleventh anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On April 4, 2023 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the fourteenth anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same.

Certain risks and uncertainties are wholly or partially outside the control of the Company and its management, including its ability to attract new franchisees; the continued success of current franchisees; the effects of competition on franchisees and consumer acceptance of the Company's products in new and existing markets; fluctuation in development and operating costs; brand awareness; availability and terms of capital; adverse publicity; acceptance of new product offerings; availability of locations and terms of sites for store development; food, labor and employee benefit costs; changes in government regulation (including increases in the minimum wage); regional economic and weather conditions; the hiring, training, and retention of skilled corporate and restaurant management; and the integration and assimilation of acquired concepts. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date hereof.

General 

There are 64 franchised and 4 licensed units at August 31, 2024 compared to 66 franchised and 3 licensed units at August 31, 2023. System-wide revenues for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 were 30.9 million and August 31, 2023 was 30.2 million. 

The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the ongoing royalties paid to the Company by its franchisees and receipt of initial franchise fees. Additionally, the Company derives revenue from the sale of licensed products (My Favorite Muffin mix, and Brewster's coffee), and through nontraditional channels of distribution. 

Royalty fees represent a 5 fee on net retail and wholesale sales of franchised units. Royalty revenues are recognized on an accrual basis using actual franchise receipts. Generally, franchisees report and remit royalties on a weekly basis. The majority of month-end receipts are recorded on an accrual basis based on actual numbers from reports received from franchisees shortly after the month-end. Estimates are utilized in certain instances where actual numbers have not been received and such estimates are based on the average of the last 10 weeks actual reported sales. 

There are two items involving revenue recognition of contracts that require us to make subjective judgments: the determination of which performance obligations are distinct within the context of the overall contract and the estimated stand-alone selling price of each obligation. In instances where our contract includes significant customization or modification services, the customization and modification services are generally combined and recorded as one distinct performance obligation. 

The Company earns licensing fees from the sale of BAB branded products, which includes coffee, cream cheese, muffin mix and frozen bagels from a third-party commercial bakery, to the franchised and licensed units. 

As of August 31, 2024, the Company employed 11 full-time employees and one part-time employee at the Corporate office. The employees are responsible for corporate management and oversight, accounting, advertising and franchising. None of the Company's employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements and management considers its relations with its employees to be good.

Adopted Accounting Policies 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard s main goal is to improve financial reporting by requiring earlier recognition of credit losses on financing receivables and other financial assets in scope, including trade receivables. The amendments in this update broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years and for interim periods with those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and there was no material financial change. Enhanced disclosures are found in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2023-09 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2026. 

Management does not believe that there are any recently issued and effective or not yet effective accounting pronouncements as of August 31, 2024 that would have or are expected to have any significant effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or income statement. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company has identified other significant accounting policies that, as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. The Company's most critical accounting policies are related to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. Details regarding the Company's use of these policies and the related estimates are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024.
