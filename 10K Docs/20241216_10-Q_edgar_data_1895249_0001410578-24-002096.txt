The Company had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s net cash used in operating activities was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the working capital deficit totaled as of September 30, 2024. The Company s ability to fund its operations is dependent upon management s plans, which include raising capital through issuances of debt and equity securities, and extending existing debt agreements. A failure to raise sufficient financing and/or extend existing debt agreements, among other factors, will adversely impact the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due and payable and to achieve its intended business objectives. Accordingly, based on the considerations discussed above, management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. impairment has occurred.

Accordingly, the Company used Level 2 inputs for these debt instrument fair value estimates. Forward Purchase Agreement The fair value of the liability pre-modification when it was assumed on July 12, 2024 and immediately before modification on August 2, 2024, was determined using a black-scholes model. Both valuations were based on the actual numbers of shares purchased by Meteora under the agreement, which was 3,288,466. The significant inputs to the model as of July 12, 2024 and August 2, 2024 are noted in the table below.

 We require capital to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures. Additional capital is necessary to fund ongoing operations, continue research, development efforts, improve infrastructure, and execute on our acquisition strategy. Our ability to access the capital markets will influence the rate at which we deploy capital. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: Seeking and obtaining market access approvals; Establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support our growth; Addressing any competing technological and market developments; Technological or manufacturing difficulties, design issues or other unforeseen matters; Identifying attractive acquisition targets that align with our current businesses; and Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. 
 If we successfully raise additional capital, we may accelerate certain development programs and other investments. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds this will lead us to delay or reduce or stop certain development activities and pursue the reduction of certain components of our operating expenses. If we cannot raise additional funds when needed, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

 Convertible Notes The Company issued 1.4 million of convertible notes in September of 2022 that mature two years from the date of issuance (September 2024). On February 22, 2023, the convertible notes were amended to clarify how these Convertible Notes convert; this modification did not change the future cash flows of the notes. The Convertible Notes automatically convert in three (3) different situations: (i) upon the consummation of a Qualified Financing, (ii) upon the consummation of a Change of Control, or (iii) upon maturity. In the case of a Qualified Financing (as defined below), the convertible notes (principal plus interest) automatically convert at a quotient, the numerator of which is the entire principal of the convertible notes and any interest accrued and the denominator is the lesser of 80 of the price per share to be sold in a financing event, or 2.11 per share, adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization with respect to such class or series. In the case of a Change of Control (as defined below), the convertible notes (principal plus interest) automatically convert into shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price that will be based upon a pre-money valuation of the Company equal to eighty percent (80.0 of the enterprise value of the Company as determined based upon the net consideration to be paid in connection with such Change of Control transaction. If the convertible notes are still outstanding at maturity, they automatically convert (principal plus interest) into shares of a separate series of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock having identical rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions as the Company s existing Series B-1 Preferred Stock, except the liquidation preference, dividend rights and anti-dilution protection will be appropriately adjusted to reflect the price per share at which the convertible notes are converted into Series B Preferred Stock, which is at the conversion price of 2.11 per share (subject to adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, or other similar recapitalization events with respect to such class or series of shares). A Qualified Financing is defined as the next transaction or series of transactions after the issuance of the Notes in which the Company sells shares of its privately issued equity securities resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least 5.0 million (not including the Notes). The closing of this transaction would not be deemed a Qualified Financing. A Change of Control means (i) that the beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the Exchange Act) of securities representing more than 50 of the combined voting power of the Company is acquired by any person as defined in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, any parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company), (ii) the merger or consolidation of the Company (A) pursuant to the Merger Agreement and/or (B) with or into another corporation where the shareholders of the Company, immediately prior to the consolidation or merger, would not, immediately after the consolidation or merger, beneficially own (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, shares representing in the aggregate 50 or more of the combined voting power of the securities of the corporation issuing cash or securities in the consolidation or merger (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any) in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, or (iii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets to an entity, other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company s assets to an entity, at least 50 of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned directly or indirectly by shareholders of the Company, immediately prior to the sale or disposition, in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale or disposition. The closing of this transaction would be deemed a Change of Control. Interest is charged at an annual (simple) rate of 5.0 . The rate increases to 8.0 upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. The Company has the right to prepay the entire principal amount of the convertible notes upon approval by the holders of the majority of the convertible notes. The Company further issued an additional 0.9 million of convertible notes under the same terms during the year ended December 31, 2023 with terms similar to those described above. Convertible Notes Due From MCAC As of September 30, 2024, the Company has provided 0.4 million to Monterey Capital Acquisition Corporation MCAC in the form of convertible notes receivable for working capital purposes. The convertible notes receivable are to be repaid to the Company upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or at the Company s option, convertible into Private Warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant.

 Libertas (Sale of Future Receipts) On April 25, 2023, the Company entered into a sale of Future Receipts agreement with Libertas Funding, LLC, an independent third party Libertas ). Pursuant to this agreement, the Company sold and assigned 1.6 million of Future Receipts in exchange for net cash proceeds of 1.2 million, including a fee of 24 thousand. As a result, the Company recorded a discount of 0.4 million. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay the third party a minimum of 30 thousand of weekly sales receipts until the Future Receipts have been collected. for the term of this agreement is approximately one year as the payments are made until the total amount of the future receipts are paid out. On November 2, 2023, the Company amended this agreement with Libertas to extend the weekly sales receipts period to one year from the amendment date, requiring weekly sales receipts of 17 thousand until the remaining Future Receipts have been collected. Further in connection with this amendment, the Company incurred an incremental fee of 0.1 million. The Company assessed this amendment, noting that the amended terms of the agreement were substantially different from the terms of the initial agreement, causing the Company to account for this amendment as an extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments ASC 470-50 ). Similarly, to the transaction in April, on August 7, 2023, the Company entered into a sale of Future Receipts Agreement with Libertas to which it sold and assigned 1.2 million of future receipts in exchange for net proceeds of 1.0 million, including a fee of 20 thousand. As a result the Company recorded a discount of 0.3 million. Under the agreement the Company agreed to pay the third party approximately 26 thousand weekly until the Future Receipts have been collected. The term of this agreement is approximately one year as the payments are made until the total amount of the future receipts are paid out. On November 29, 2023, the Company amended this agreement with Libertas to borrow an incremental 0.4 million. Due to this refinancing, Libertas forgave a portion of this debt outstanding totaling 0.1 million and the Company incurred an incremental fee of 0.2 million. The Company assessed this amendment, noting that the amended terms of the agreement were substantially different from the terms of the initial agreement, causing the Company to account for this amendment as an extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50. As a result of the amendments noted above, as of December 31, 2023, all remaining discounts were written off. As a result of the amendments noted above, the Company wrote off all remaining debt discounts, yielding incremental interest expense of 0.7 million. This loss on extinguishment of debt was offset by the forgiveness of debt in connection with each amendment, as discussed above, of 0.2 million relating to the first amendment and 0.1 million relating to the second amendment, yielding a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.4 million that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023. On January 4, 2024, like the transactions in April and August of 2023, the Company entered into a sale of Future Receipts Agreement with Libertas to which it sold and assigned 0.5 million of future receipts in exchange for net proceeds of 0.4 million, including an origination fee of 7 thousand and an original issuance discount of 0.1 million. As a result, the Company recorded a discount of 0.1 million. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay the third party approximately 9 thousand weekly until the Future Receipts have been collected. The term of this agreement is approximately one year as the payments are made until the total amount of the future receipts are paid out. On January 30, 2024, the Company amended each of its outstanding agreements with Libertas to consolidate the agreements into one without any change to the total Future Receipts committed. In connection with this amendment, the Company sold a total of 2.6 million of Future Receipts in exchange for the remaining balances on each of the Company s outstanding agreements with Libertas as of the date of the transaction, totaling 2.1 million with an original issuance discount of 0.5 million. The Company assessed this amendment, noting that the amended terms of the agreement were substantially different from the terms of the initial agreement, causing the Company to account for this amendment as an extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50. As a result of the amendment, as of September 30, 2024, all unamortized discounts were written off, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of 0.6 million. In connection with these instruments, the Company recorded discounts. These discounts are recorded as an adjustment to the related liability within the Current portion of debt, net of discount in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As discussed above, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the discounts offered associated with these borrowings were zero. In connection with the January 30, 2024 amendment, the Company erroneously received an incremental 1.1 million from Libertas. Such amounts received were provided to the Company in error and are due and payable in full to Libertas. Libertas has agreed to loan the Company this amount and is currently negotiating repayment terms with the Company. This is shown as a Due to Libertas on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 Since the Company has significant continuing involvement in the generation of future cash flows due under these agreements among other indicators, pursuant to ASC 470 -10-25-2, Debt- Sales of Future Revenues or Other Various Measures of Income , the Company has reflected any future commitments to Libertas associated with these agreements as Debt. The balance of the total sale on Future Receipts stated above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is 2.4 million and 1.9 million, respectively, which is included in the current portion of debt on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Other Notes The Company also has other smaller loans that are described within Note 7 to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. Going Concern The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company incurred net losses of 12.2 million and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 17.0 million and 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of 39.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s net cash used in operating activities was 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the working capital deficit totaled 31.2 as of September 30, 2024. The Company s ability to fund its operations is dependent upon management s plans, which include raising capital through issuances of debt and equity securities, and extending existing debt agreements. A failure to raise sufficient financing and/or extend existing debt agreements, among other factors, will adversely impact the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due and payable and to achieve its intended business objectives. Accordingly, based on the considerations discussed above, management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management s plans to address the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include the following: obtaining additional financing from related parties and third parties; and potentially extend existing debt agreements. 
 The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Further, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its current noteholders will provide relief and extend the Company s current required payments under its debt agreements. ConnectM s primary uses of cash are to fund its operations as it continues to grow its business. ConnectM will require a significant amount of cash for expenditures as it invests in continuing its acquisition strategy and capitalizes on synergies because of such acquisitions. We have experienced significant net losses since our inception and, given the significant expenditures associated with our business plan, we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses. ConnectM s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section entitled Risk Factors. To the extent that current and anticipated sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, ConnectM may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing after the closing of the Business Combination. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to stockholders after the closing. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligation and instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financial covenants that could restrict ConnectM s operations. There can also be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.

Commitments and Contractual Obligations Litigation The Company is from time to time subject to routine legal claims, proceedings and regulatory matters, most of which are incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company accrues for potential liability arising from legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This determination is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Company is involved, taking into account its best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimates can be made. The Company s estimate involve significant judgement, given the varying stages of proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims), and the related uncertainty of the potential outcomes of these proceedings. In making determinations of the likely outcome of pending litigation, the Company considers many factors, including, but not limited to, the nature of the claims, the Company s experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative mechanisms, the matter s current status and the

 damages sought or demands made. Accordingly, the Company s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses could be more or less than the current estimate.

Specifically, the plaintiffs allege breach of the stock purchase agreement and certain promissory notes in connection with the purchase of Florida Solar Products, Inc. and the related real estate, as well as breach of a services agreement with Mr. Zrallack. The Company believes the Plaintiffs claims have no merit and plans to assert counterclaims against the Plaintiffs in connection with the underlying transactions. The Company is defending itself in this matter. Currently, the Company prevailed on a motion to compel arbitration, so the lawsuit is stayed, and the Court ordered the entire case to arbitration.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses and net loss incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ConnectM s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk This item is not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, we did not design and maintain an effective control environment to prevent or detect material misstatements in the financial statements. The following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting were identified: Controls over the accuracy and completeness of information included in our SEC filings including documents filed as exhibits to registration statements and information within registration statements. Controls over accuracy and completeness of financial data, specifically prepaid and accrued expenses. Complex financial instruments accounting including relevant literature that applies to the accounting for forward purchase agreements, the business combination, acquisition accounting, and complex debt. 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Identified Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting To address these material weaknesses management has devoted, and plans to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of its internal control over financial reporting, and to provide processes and controls over the internal communications within the Company, financial reporting advisors, legal advisors, and independent registered public accounting firm. The Company s efforts include the following: The Company implemented additional procedures to ensure that all legal agreements are reviewed by management, third-party accounting advisors and legal advisors in their final drafts before such agreements are executed. The Company implemented additional review procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of financial data and accrued liabilities. The Company utilized the expertise of outside financial reporting and valuation advisors to better evaluate the research and understanding of the nuances of the accounting standards that apply to the complex financial instrument. The Company is implementing additional oversight of the cash availability for the Company s operational needs.

 We can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than changes that have resulted from the material weakness remediation activities noted above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
