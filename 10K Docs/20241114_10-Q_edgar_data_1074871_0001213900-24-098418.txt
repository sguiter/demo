Stock-Based Compensation Expense 

Stock options granted by the Company generally
vest over 36 months and have a -year term. As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized compensation cost related to stock options was
approximately and is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately years. 

In October 2023, under its Two-Part FDA Submission
and Clearance Milestone Bonus Program (the Bonus Program), the Company granted stock options to purchase shares of common stock,
which were subject to vesting based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones by the Company and continued service by the
optionees. In January 2024, options to purchase shares (net of forfeitures), which were granted under part one of the Bonus Program,
vested upon the Company s submission to the FDA. In August 2024, options to purchase shares (net of forfeitures), which
were granted under part two of the Bonus Program, were canceled, as the Company did not receive clearance from the FDA for its MODD1 product
by August 1, 2024. In August 2024, the Company granted new options to purchase shares (the Clearance Options), which were subject
to vesting based upon the Company s receipt of clearance from the FDA for its MODD1 product by December 31, 2024 and continued service
by the optionees. The Clearance options vested in full in September 2024 upon the Company s receipt of clearance from the FDA for
its MODD1 product. 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of
options granted was and per share for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and

The fair values of options at the grant date were
estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation model, which includes simplified methods to establish the fair term of options, as well
as average volatility. The risk-free interest rate was derived from the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates, as published by the U.S. Department
of the Treasury as of the grant date for terms equal to the expected terms of the options. A dividend yield of zero was applied because
the Company has never paid dividends and has no intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company accounts for forfeitures
as they occur.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report). This Report contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which include, without
limitation, statements about the market for our technology, our strategy, competition, expected financial performance and capital raising
efforts, and other aspects of our business identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on June 21, 2024 and in other reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any statements
about our business, financial results, financial condition and operations contained in this Report that are not statements of historical
fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, 
 expects, intends, plans, projects, or similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements
as a result of various factors, including the risk factors described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2024. These forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events
and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors including, without limitation, the direct and indirect effects of coronavirus
disease 2019, or COVID-19, as well as inflationary risks, including the risk that the cost of certain of the Company s components
is increasing, and related issues that may arise therefrom. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than
we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
of this Report. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Report and attributable
to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred
to in this Report. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise. 

Our fiscal year ends on March 31 of each calendar
year. Each reference to a fiscal year in this Report, refers to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the calendar year indicated (for example,
fiscal 2025 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025). Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, 
 our, and the Company refer to Modular Medical, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary . 

Company Overview 

We are a pre-revenue medical device company focused
on the design, development and commercialization of innovative insulin pumps using modernized technology to increase pump adoption in
the diabetes marketplace. Through the creation of a novel two-part patch pump, our initial product, the MODD1, we seek to fundamentally
alter the trade-offs between cost and complexity and access to the higher standards of care that presently-available insulin pumps provide.
By simplifying and streamlining the user experience from introduction, prescription, reimbursement, training and day-to-day use, we seek
to expand the wearable insulin delivery device market beyond the highly motivated super users and expand the category into
the mass market. The product seeks to serve both the type 1 and the rapidly growing, especially in terms of device adoption, type 2 diabetes
markets. In January 2024, we submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA for our MODD1 insulin pump, and, in September 2024, we received FDA clearance to market and sell our MODD1 pump in the United States. 

Historically, we have financed our operations
principally through private placements and public offerings of our common stock and sales of convertible promissory notes. Based on our
current operating plan, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the
date that the financial statements included in Item 1 of this Report are issued exists. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends
on our ability to raise additional capital, through the sale of equity or debt securities, to support our future operations. If we are
unable to secure additional capital, we will be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures
to reduce costs. We have provided additional disclosure in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Report and
under Liquidity below.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we make these estimates based on our historical
experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and
reported results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are disclosed
in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. As of
September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates.

Our research and development, or R D, expenses
include personnel, consulting, testing, materials and supplies, depreciation and amortization and other operational costs associated with
the pre-FDA clearance production of our insulin pump product. We expense R D costs as they are incurred. 

R D expenses increased for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense of 0.5 million,
employee-related costs of approximately 0.2 million and increased depreciation expense of approximately 0.2 million. These increases
were partially offset by decreases of approximately 0.2 million in consulting expenses and 0.2 million in material costs. 

R D expenses increased for the six months
ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation costs of approximately
 0.5 million, increased employee-related costs of approximately 0.4 million, an increase in depreciation expense of approximately 0.3
million and an increase in travel-related and other costs of approximately 0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an approximately
 0.3 million decrease in material and supplies costs. Our full-time R D employee headcount increased to 42 at September 30, 2024 from
39 at September 30, 2023. R D expenses included stock-based compensation expenses of approximately 0.8 million and 0.4 million for
the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.2 million and 0.7 million for the six-month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025, as we commence
initial activities in support of commercialization of our MODD1 product.

G A expenses
increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023, primarily as a result of increases
in professional service, recruiting, legal and consulting expenses of approximately 0.3 million. 

G A expenses increased for the six months
ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in legal and professional services
expenses of approximately 0.3 million and stock-based compensation expense of approximately 0.1 million, partially offset by decreases
in travel-related and other costs of 0.1 million. G A expenses included stock-based compensation expenses of approximately 0.2 million
for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 0.4 million and 0.3 million for the six months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect G A expenses to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025, as we commence initial activities
in support of commercialization of our MODD1 product. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources; Changes
in Financial Condition 

We do not currently have revenues to generate
cash flows to cover operating expenses. Since our inception, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows in each year due
to costs incurred in connection with our operations. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended March 31, 2024, we incurred
net losses of approximately 9.1 million and 17.5 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 3.9 million
and an accumulated deficit of approximately 75 million. We expect to continue to incur operating
losses for the foreseeable future and incur cash outflows from operations, as we continue to invest in the development and commercialization
of our products. We expect that our expenses will continue to increase, and, as a result, we will eventually need to generate significant
revenue to achieve profitability. When considered with our current operating plan, these conditions raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date that the financial statements included in Item
1 of this Report are issued. Our financial statements do not include adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities
that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our
business, including amounts required to fund continued research and development activities, working capital and capital expenditures.
Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to raise additional capital, through the sale of equity or debt securities
to support our future operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we completed an offering of shares of common stock for
net proceeds of approximately 10.3 million, which includes the proceeds from the underwriter s exercise of the overallotment. In
November 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Leerink Partners LLC Leerink under
which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock (subject to availability on our shelf
registration statement) through an at the market offering program under which Leerink will act as sales agent or principal.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 824,514 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 1.9 million
under the ATM Agreement. Subject to market conditions, we expect to resume sales under the ATM during the remainder of fiscal 2025, however,
the potential net proceeds from such future sales are unknown. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received
a total of approximately 0.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock purchase warrants issued in a public offering we completed
in May 2023. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including, without limitation,
our ability to successfully commercialize our MODD1 product, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into
collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product offerings. If we are
unable to secure additional capital timely, we may be required to curtail product commercialization
and R D initiatives, reduce headcount and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash. 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024,
we used approximately 7.3 million of cash in operating activities, which primarily resulted from our net loss of approximately 9.1
million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 0.3 million, as adjusted for stock-based
compensation expenses of approximately 1.6 million, depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately 0.5 million and
other immaterial adjustments. For the six months ended six September 30, 2023, we used approximately 6.5 million in operating activities,
which primarily resulted from our net loss of approximately 7.9 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately
 0.2 million, as adjusted for stock-based compensation expenses of approximately 1.0 million,
net changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 0.2 million and depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately
 0.2 million. 

16 

For the
six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities of approximately 1.0 million and 0.7 million ,
respectively, was for the purchase of property and equipment. 

Cash provided by financing activities of approximately
 3.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to proceeds from the at-the-market sales of stock and exercise
of common stock purchase warrants. Cash provided by financing activities of 9.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was
attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and common stock purchase warrants in a public offering, net of underwriting
fees and issuance costs. 

Purchase Obligations 

Our primary purchase
obligations include purchase orders for machinery and equipment. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding purchase orders for machinery
and equipment and related expenditures of approximately 1.0 million. 

In December 2023, we
signed a device integration agreement with a provider of connected-care and remote monitoring diabetes technology solutions. As of September
30, 2024, we had a remaining obligation under the device integration agreement of approximately 0.4 million over three years for
technology license fees. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements are
detailed in Note 1 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

Not required. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based
on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
