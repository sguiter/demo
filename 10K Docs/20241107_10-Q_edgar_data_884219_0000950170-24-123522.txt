equity ownership interest in Esja Attractions ehf. Esja ), which owns the FlyOver Iceland attraction. The Esja shareholders agreement contains a put option that gives the minority Esja shareholders the right to sell (or put their Esja shares to us based on a calculated formula within a predefined term. This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered mezzanine equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholders equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of the net income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and the accretion of the redemption value is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit and is included in our income (loss) per common share. Refer to Note 22 Noncontrolling Interests Redeemable and Non-redeemable for additional information. 
 
 years. Our equipment leases comprise mainly vehicles, hardware, and office equipment, each with various lease terms. Our land leases comprise mainly leases in Canada and Iceland on which our Pursuit hotels or attractions are located and have lease terms ranging up to years. If a lease contains a renewal option that is reasonably certain to be exercised, then the lease term includes the optional periods in measuring a ROU asset and lease liability. We evaluate the reasonably certain threshold at lease commencement, and it is typically met if we identify substantial economic incentives or termination penalties. We do not include variable leases and variable non-lease components in the calculation of the ROU asset and corresponding lease liability. For facility leases, variable lease costs include the costs of common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance for which we pay our lessors an estimate that is adjusted to actual expense on a quarterly or annual basis depending on the underlying contract terms. We expense these variable lease payments as incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Substantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, we utilize an incremental borrowing rate based on lease term and country in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a collateralized basis and is the expected rate at which we would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term and the country. We are also a lessor to third party tenants who either lease certain portions of facilities that we own or sublease certain portions of facilities that we lease. We record lease income from owned facilities as rental income and we record sublease income from leased facilities as an offset to lease expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We classify all of our leases for which we are the lessor as operating leases.

million against the net book value of the Wilderness Kitchen. This loss is covered by our property insurance and accordingly, we recorded an offsetting impairment recovery of million. We also recorded an impairment charge of million against intangible assets (trademark and favorable lease) of the Wilderness Kitchen. We incurred costs at our other properties affected by the Jasper wildfires of million, which are deemed probable of recovery through our insurance. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received million in insurance proceeds as a partial settlement, of which million was allocated to the charge for the Wilderness Kitchen and million was allocated against the insurance receivable for costs incurred. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining balance in the insurance receivable of million represents costs that are deemed probable of recovery. We include the insurance receivable in Other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

GES performance obligations consist of services or product(s) outlined in a contract. While we often sign multi-year contracts for recurring events, the obligations for each occurrence are well defined and conclude upon the occurrence of each event. The obligations are typically the provision of services and/or sale of a product in connection with a live event. Revenue for goods and services provided for which we do not have control of the goods or services before that good or service is transferred to a customer is recorded on a net basis to reflect only the fees received for arranging these services. We recognize revenue for services generally at the close of the live event. We recognize revenue for products either upon delivery to the customer s location, upon delivery to an event that we are serving, or when we have the right to invoice. In circumstances where a customer cancels a contract, we generally have the right to bill the customer for costs incurred to date. - days and contain no significant financing components. Contract Liabilities Pursuit and GES typically receive customer deposits prior to transferring the related product or service to the customer. We record these deposits as a contract liability, which are recognized as revenue upon satisfaction of the related contract performance obligation(s). GES also provides customer rebates and volume discounts to certain event organizers that we recognize as a reduction of revenue. We include customer deposits in Contract liabilities and Other deferred items and liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We use a discounted expected future cash flow methodology (income approach) to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. We do not believe there have been any significant changes to the outlook for the future years or to the risk profile of our reporting units that would indicate that goodwill impairment testing should have been performed as of September 30, 2024.

The proceeds of the Term Loan B, net of million in related fees, were used to repay the million outstanding balance under our prior million revolving credit facility and to provide for financial flexibility to fund future acquisitions and growth initiatives and for general corporate purposes. On October 6, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility, which among other things, increased the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by million, bringing the total amount of revolving capacity to million, and added Brewster Inc., an Alberta corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as a co-borrower. In connection with the amendment, we prepaid million of the outstanding balance on our existing Term Loan B using million from the Revolving Credit Facility, which has a lower credit spread as discussed below, and million of cash from the Company s balance sheet.

Revolving Credit Facility The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of and carries financial covenants. On March 23, 2022, we entered into the First Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility and on March 28, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility. These amendments modified the financial covenants to the following: Maintain a total net leverage ratio of not greater than to 1.00; and

As of September 30, 2024 , capacity remaining under the Revolving Credit Facility was million, reflecting million total facility size, less million in outstanding letters of credit. In addition to U.S. dollar borrowings and Canadian dollar borrowings, we may also borrow funds on the Revolving Credit Facility in Pound Sterling based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average and Euros based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR , plus applicable credit spreads. No such borrowings had been made as of September 30, 2024.

million in SOFR-based borrowings under our 2021 Credit Facility and provides us with the right to receive payment if the one-month SOFR exceeds the Strike Rate. Beginning on February 28, 2023, we pay a fixed monthly deferred premium based on an annual rate of for the interest rate cap, which matures on . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we received gross proceeds from the interest rate cap of million and million, respectively, as one-month SOFR exceeded the Strike Rate. We designated the interest rate cap as a cash flow hedge designed to hedge the variability of the SOFR-based interest payments on our 2021 Credit Facility. The interest rate cap is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The fair value is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques and reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate cap including the price of the cap and the period to maturity. While there are no quoted prices in active markets, our calculation uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The interest rate cap is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 13 Fair Value Measurements for the related fair value disclosures.

 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate was for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax provision was computed based on our estimated annualized effective tax rate and the full-year forecasted income or loss plus the tax impact of unusual, infrequent, or nonrecurring significant items during the period. The amount and change of pre-tax income and loss recognized between jurisdictions impacted the reported effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we do not recognize a tax benefit primarily on losses in the United States where we have a valuation allowance, while recognizing tax expense in Canada, Netherlands, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, and Iceland. We included in the annualized effective rate a million benefit for the release of the valuation allowance recorded on the United Kingdom s tax loss carryforwards as the United Kingdom s forecasted income will fully utilize these carryforward losses for the year. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we released the valuation allowance of million recorded on deferred tax assets with certain separate states. We also recorded a million expense during the first quarter of 2024 to record estimated withholding taxes associated with repatriating all of Sky Lagoon s earnings back to the United States and a valuation allowance against the tax credit generated from this withholding tax. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was further impacted by the release of a valuation allowance of million during the first quarter of 2023 on deferred tax assets associated with certain separate state filings, which more than offset taxes due in jurisdictions without a valuation allowance. We paid net cash for income taxes of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of which million was paid to Canadian taxing authorities, million to the Netherlands, and million to the United Kingdom . We paid net cash for income taxes of million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , of which million was paid to Canadian tax authorities.

In addition, we believe that our reserves and, subject to customary deductibles, our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover potential claims related to this accident. We are subject to various United States federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which we have or had operations. If we fail to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed, and we could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders. As is the case with many companies, we also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to our past operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had recorded environmental remediation liabilities of million related to previously sold operations. Although we are a party to certain environmental disputes, we believe that any resulting liabilities, after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage, will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, on behalf of our subsidiaries, we had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties. These guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the condensed consolidated financial statements and relate to leased facilities and equipment leases entered into by our subsidiary operations. We would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under all guarantees existing as of September 30, 2024 would be approximately million. These guarantees relate to our leased equipment and facilities through . There are recourse provisions

collective bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year. If we are unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective bargaining process, the union may call for a strike or work stoppage, which may, under certain circumstances, adversely impact our business and results of operations. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory and that collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2024 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business. Although our labor relations are currently stable, disruptions could occur, with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of GES. We are self-insured up to certain limits for workers compensation and general liabilities, which includes automobile, product general liability, and client property loss claims. The aggregate amount of insurance liabilities (up to our retention limits), and including our estimated incurred but not yet reported claims, related to our continuing operations was million as of September 30, 2024 , which includes million related to workers compensation liabilities, and million related to general liability claims. We have also retained and provided for certain workers compensation insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses of million as of September 30, 2024 . We are also self-insured for certain employee health benefits and the estimated employee health benefit claims incurred but not yet reported was million as of September 30, 2024 . Provisions for losses for claims incurred, including actuarially derived estimated claims incurred but not yet reported, are made based on our historical experience, claims frequency, and other factors. A change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities. We have purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self-insured levels, which generally range from million to million on a per claim basis. We do not maintain a self-insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement. Our net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 , we have recorded insurance liabilities of million related to continuing operations, which represents the amount for which we remain the primary obligor after self-insured insurance limits, without taking into consideration the above-referenced insurance coverage. Of this total, million is related to workers compensation liabilities and million is related to general/auto liability claims, which is recorded in Other deferred items and liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding receivable in Other investments and assets.

The put option is exercisable during a period of months following the Reference Date (the Option Period if the Put Option Condition has been met. If the Put Option Condition has not been met during the first Option Period, the Reference Date will be extended for an additional months up to three times. If the Put Option Condition is met during any of the Option Periods, yet the shares are not exercised prior to the end of the 12-month Option Period, the put option will expire. If the FlyOver Iceland attraction has not achieved the Put Option Condition by December 31, 2024, the put option expires. As of September 30, 2024, the FlyOver Iceland attraction has not achieved the Put Option Condition and we do not anticipate the Put Option Condition to be achieved prior to expiration. The noncontrolling interest s carrying value is determined by the fair value of the noncontrolling interest as of the acquisition date and the noncontrolling interest s share of the subsequent net income or loss. This value is benchmarked against the redemption value of the sellers put option. The carrying value is adjusted to the redemption value, provided that it does not fall below the initial carrying value, as determined by the purchase price allocation. We have made a policy election to reflect any changes caused by such an adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit), rather than to current earnings (loss).

Of the total cash consideration, million will be deferred for one year following the transaction closing date and is contingent only on the passage of time. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. This transaction did not meet the held-for-sale classification criteria as of September 30, 2024, as the agreement had not been finalized on that date nor had the requisite approvals from our Board of Directors authorizing management to commit to the sale, but our GES business is expected to be reflected as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. Jasper Wildfires Insurance Proceeds Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Pursuit received additional partial settlement payments of approximately million from the insurance company related to the Jasper wildfires. We are currently working with our insurance carriers to determine the extent of potential recoveries from our policies. Assessment of the full value of the loss is ongoing. Acquisition of Eddie s Caf Mercantile On November 6, 2024, Pursuit expanded its collection of accommodation and hospitality experiences within Glacier National Park with the acquisition of Eddie s Caf Mercantile for million. Eddie s Caf Mercantile offers a combination of food and beverage, retail, and six newly constructed overnight accommodation units and is located adjacent to Pursuit s existing 48 room Apgar Village Lodge.

Overview 
 We are a leading provider of extraordinary experiences, including hospitality and leisure activities, experiential marketing, and live events. We operate through three reportable segments: Pursuit, Spiro, and GES Exhibitions. Spiro and GES Exhibitions are both live event businesses, and are referred to collectively as GES. 
 Recent Developments 
 Sale of GES Business 
 On October 20, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our GES business to Truelink Capital for 535 million. The purchase price is subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses, and will be paid in cash. Of the total cash consideration, 25 million will be deferred for one year following the transaction closing date and is contingent only on the passage of time. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. 
 Jasper Wildfires 
 On July 22, 2024, Jasper National Park was closed and evacuated due to wildfire activity, and a wildfire entered the Jasper townsite on July 24, 2024. All of Pursuit s hotels and attractions in and near the Jasper townsite, as well as our Pyramid Lake Lodge, Miette Mountain Cabins, and Maligne Lake Cruise were not reached by the wildfire and remain intact except for Pursuit s Wilderness Kitchen, a restaurant and retail operation located about three miles outside the town of Jasper. The town of Jasper re-opened to residents and local businesses on August 16, 2024. All of Pursuit s hotels in Jasper are open with the exception of Pyramid Lake Lodge, which sustained superficial damage to areas of the roof and to the exterior facade. 
 Pursuit s Columbia Icefield Glacier Adventure and Skywalk re-opened on August 9, 2024. Maligne Lake Road re-opened on October 12, 2024, after the peak summer season. Due to this road closure, the Maligne Lake Cruises did not reopen during the remainder of the 2024 season. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received 4.7 million in insurance proceeds as a partial settlement. During October 2024, we received additional partial settlement payments of approximately 1.5 million. We are currently working with our insurance carriers to determine the extent of potential recoveries from our policies. Assessment of the full value of the loss is ongoing. 
 Jasper SkyTram 
 On June 26, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Jasper SkyTram attraction in Jasper National Park. All conditions precedent to the closing of the Jasper SkyTram acquisition have yet to be satisfied and have been delayed to an unknown extent by the Jasper wildfires as noted above. 
 Seasonality 
 Pursuit s peak activity occurs during the summer months. During 2023, 79 of Pursuit s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters. 
 GES live event activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the frequency and timing of shows. Some shows are not held annually and some shift between quarters.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenue increased 89.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased revenue at GES of 94.5 million, offset in part by decreased revenue at Pursuit of 4.7 million. 

Net income attributable to Viad increased 7.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting higher segment operating income at GES of 22.0 million, offset in part by: (i) impairment charges of 6.1 million of which 5.5 million was related to the facility lease termination of FlyOver Canada Toronto and 0.6 million was related to intangible assets of Pursuit s Wilderness Kitchen, which was lost in the Jasper wildfires, (ii) lower segment operating income at Pursuit of 5.5 million, and (iii) higher corporate activities of 4.2 million, primarily due to transaction-related costs including consulting, accounting, and legal costs incurred related to the pending sale of the GES business. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenue increased 160.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased revenue at GES of 148.1 million and increased revenue at Pursuit of 12.6 million. 

Net income attributable to Viad increased 21.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting higher segment operating income at GES of 40.9 million, offset in part by: (i) lower segment operating income at Pursuit of 7.4 million, (ii) higher corporate activities of 7.4 million primarily due to transaction-related costs including consulting, accounting, and legal costs incurred related to the pending sale of the GES business, and (iii) impairment charges of 6.1 million as discussed above.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Pursuit revenue decreased 4.7 million driven primarily by a decrease in hospitality revenue of 5.3 million due to a 13.6 decrease in revenue per available room as a result of fewer room nights sold due to the Jasper wildfires, offset in part by an increase in attractions revenue of 1.4 million due to higher revenue per attraction visitor of 4.2 . FlyOver Chicago opened on March 1, 2024 and contributed revenue of 3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Pursuit segment operating income decreased 5.5 million from the prior year period primarily due to decreased revenue as a result of the Jasper wildfires, higher depreciation expense of 2.4 million, as well as an increase in operating costs to support higher business volume during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 32 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Pursuit revenue increased 12.6 million driven primarily by an increase in attractions revenue of 13.8 million due to a 4.6 increase in the number of visitors as well as higher revenue per attraction visitor of 3.6 . Our Sky Lagoon attraction in Iceland had particularly strong demand with increased revenue of 7.5 million. FlyOver Chicago contributed revenue of 6.4 million during its first seven months of operations commencing on March 1, 2024. 
 Pursuit segment operating income decreased 7.4 million from the prior year period primarily due to the Jasper wildfires and higher depreciation expense of 4.5 million, an increase in operating costs to support higher business volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as start-up costs to open the FlyOver Chicago attraction, offset in part by an increase in revenue. 
 Performance Measures 
 We use the following key business metrics to evaluate the performance of Pursuit s attractions business: 
 Number of visitors . The number of visitors allows us to assess the volume of tickets sold at each attraction during the period. 

Revenue per attraction visitor . Revenue per attraction visitor is calculated as total attractions revenue divided by the total number of visitors at all Pursuit attractions during the period. Total attractions revenue includes ticket sales and ancillary revenue generated by attractions, such as food and beverage and retail revenue. Total attractions revenue per visitor measures the total spend per visitor that attraction properties are able to capture, which is important to the profitability of the attractions business. 

Effective ticket price . Effective ticket price is calculated as revenue from the sale of attraction tickets divided by the total number of visitors at all comparable Pursuit attractions during the period. 

We use the following key business metrics, common in the hospitality industry, to evaluate Pursuit s hospitality business: 
 Revenue per Available Room RevPAR ). RevPAR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period. Total rooms revenue does not include non-rooms revenue, which consists of ancillary revenue generated by hospitality properties, such as food and beverage and retail revenue. RevPAR measures the period-over-period change in rooms revenue per available room for comparable hospitality properties. RevPAR is affected by average daily rate and occupancy, which have different implications on profitability. 

Average Daily Rate ADR ). ADR is calculated as total rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period. ADR is used to assess the pricing levels that the hospitality properties are able to realize. Increases in ADR lead to increases in rooms revenue with no substantial effect on variable costs, therefore having a greater impact on margins than increases in occupancy. 

Occupancy. Occupancy is calculated as the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available for all comparable Pursuit hospitality properties during the period. Occupancy measures the utilization of the available capacity at the hospitality properties. Increases in occupancy result in increases in rooms revenue and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities, and room amenity costs), as well as increases in ancillary non-rooms revenue (including food and beverage and retail revenue).

Attractions . The decrease in number of attractions visitors during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by decreased visitation at the Maligne Lake Cruise, Glacier Adventure, and the Columbia Icefield Skywalk attractions, which were temporarily closed during the peak 2024 season as a result of the Jasper wildfires. The increase in the number of attraction visitors during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher visitation at FlyOver Chicago, which opened on March 1, 2024, and Sky Lagoon in Iceland. The increase in same-store effective ticket price during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by revenue management efforts. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, attractions ticket revenue on a same-store basis increased 8.1 million on a 2.2 increase in visitors and a 13.5 increase in effective ticket price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, attractions ticket revenue on a same-store basis increased 16.3 million on a 2.9 increase in visitors and a 12.9 increase in effective ticket price. 
 Hospitality . The decrease in RevPAR during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in rooms revenue as a result of the Jasper wildfires, offset in part by an increase in ADR. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, rooms revenue on a same-store basis increased 8.5 and 8.9 , respectively.

Effective August 6, 2024, this facility lease was terminated. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an asset impairment charge of 5.5 million related to site-specific engineering plans developed for this attraction. 
 Additionally, during July 2024, a wildfire entered Jasper National Park and Pursuit s Wilderness Kitchen was lost to the wildfire. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an asset impairment charge of 3.8 million against the net book value of the Wilderness Kitchen. This loss is covered by our property insurance and accordingly, we recorded an offsetting impairment recovery of 3.8 million. We also recorded an impairment charge of 0.6 million against intangible assets (trademark and favorable lease) of the Wilderness Kitchen. See Recent Developments - Jasper Wildfires above for additional information. 
 Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate was 15.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 15.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, 22.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 25.3 for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates differed from the 21 federal rate as we do not recognize a tax benefit primarily on losses in the United States where we have a valuation allowance. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we released a valuation allowance of 0.5 million recorded on deferred tax assets with certain separate states. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also recorded a 1.1 million benefit for the release of the valuation allowance recorded on the United Kingdom s tax loss carryforwards, offset by a 0.5 million expense during the first quarter of 2024 to record estimated withholding taxes associated with repatriating Sky Lagoon s earnings and a valuation allowance against the tax credit generated from this withholding tax. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was further impacted by the release of a valuation allowance of 2.1 million during the first quarter of 2023 on deferred tax assets associated with certain separate state filings, which more than offset taxes due in jurisdictions without a valuation allowance. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and projected capital outlays for at least the next 12 months and the longer term. 
 When assessing our current sources of liquidity, we include the following:

(1) As of September 30, 2024, we held 54.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents outside of the United States. 

(2) As of September 30, 2024, the available capacity includes our total Revolving Credit Facility size of 170 million less 5.7 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the available capacity includes 

36 

our total Revolving Credit Facility size of 170 million less 57.0 million of outstanding borrowings and 5.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Cash provided by operating activities, supplemented by our revolving credit facility and existing cash and cash equivalents, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our business requirements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 133.1 million. 
 Our short-term and long-term funding requirements include debt obligations, maintenance capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and potential acquisitions and strategic investments as we focus on scaling Pursuit with investments in high-return unforgettable, inspiring experiences through its Refresh, Build, Buy growth strategy. Our projected capital outlays can be adjusted for changes in the operating environment. 
 Debt Obligations 
 Effective July 30, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2021 Credit Facility provided for a 400 million Term Loan B, with a maturity date of July 30, 2028, and a 100 million Revolving Credit Facility, with a maturity date of July 30, 2026. The proceeds of the Term Loan B, net of 14.8 million in related fees, were used to repay the 327 million outstanding balance under our prior 450 million revolving credit facility and to provide for financial flexibility to fund future acquisitions and growth initiatives and for general corporate purposes. On January 4, 2023, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with an effective date of January 31, 2023. The interest rate cap manages our exposure to interest rate increases on 300 million in borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility or other SOFR-based borrowings. Refer to Note 12 Derivative of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for additional information. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility carries financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On March 28, 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility, which modified the interest coverage financial covenant. On October 6, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility, which among other things, increased the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by 70 million, bringing the total amount of revolving capacity to 170 million. In connection with the Third Amendment, we prepaid 70 million of the outstanding balance on our existing Term Loan B using 60 million from the Revolving Credit Facility and 10 million of cash from the Company s balance sheet. The current credit spread on our Revolving Credit Facility is 2.00 lower than the credit spread on the Term Loan B, which was 5.00 for SOFR borrowings through April 25, 2024. On April 26, 2024, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility, which among other things, (i) reduced the SOFR credit spread from 5.00 to 4.25 on the Term Loan B, (ii) set the additional credit spread adjustments to 0 on the Term Loan B and (iii) reset the 1 prepayment premium on any repricings of the Term Loan B for six months. 
 On June 28, 2024, we entered into the CDOR Transition Amendment to the 2021 Credit Facility to replace the CDOR with the CORRA for Canadian Dollar borrowings on our revolver. Additional credit spread adjustments apply to CORRA ranging from 0.29547 (for a one-month duration) up to 0.32138 for a three-month duration). 
 For additional information about our debt and finance obligations, refer to Note 11 Debt and Finance Obligations of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q), all of which is incorporated by reference herein. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have planned capital expenditures of approximately 70 million to 80 million for the next 12 months, including approximately 30 million to 40 million on select growth projects. We intend to continue making selective investments to advance Pursuit s Refresh, Build, Buy growth strategy while maintaining a solid liquidity position. 
 Other Obligations 
 We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for debt obligations and capital expenditures. Refer to Note 20 Leases and Other and Note 18 Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further information. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on changes to agreed-upon amounts for certain obligations. 
 37 

Sale of GES Business 
 On October 20, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our GES business to Truelink Capital for 535 million. The purchase price is subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses, and will be paid in cash. Of the total cash consideration, 25 million will be deferred for one year following the transaction closing date and is contingent only on the passage of time. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. 
 Upon closing of the GES transaction, Pursuit will have a strong balance sheet to execute on its growth strategy. Cash proceeds from the transaction will be used to retire Viad s 2021 Credit Facility, which comprises a Term Loan B (with 318 million outstanding, bearing interest at SOFR + 425 basis points) and a 170 million Revolving Credit Facility (of which zero was drawn as of September 30, 2024), and to accelerate Pursuit s growth through its Refresh, Build, Buy growth strategy.

 Share Repurchases 
 Our Board of Directors previously authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices. As of September 30, 2024, 546,283 shares remained available for repurchase under all prior authorizations. In March 2020, our Board of Directors suspended our share repurchase program. The Board of Directors authorization does not have an expiration date. 
 Additionally, we repurchased shares related to tax withholding requirements on vested restricted share-based awards. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Refer to Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. 
 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1 Overview and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for additional information. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The foreign exchange risk is composed of both potential losses from the translation of foreign currency financial information and the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions. Interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. 
 Our foreign operations are primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Iceland, the Netherlands, the Middle East, and Germany. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of AOCI in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to our net equity position reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not currently hedge our equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We recorded cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation losses in stockholders equity of 41.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and 35.3 million as of December 31, 2023. We recorded an unrealized foreign currency translation loss in other comprehensive income (loss) of 6.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For purposes of consolidation, revenue, costs and expenses, gains, and losses related to our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period. As a result, our consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as revenue and segment operating income (loss) of our foreign operations, when translated, may vary from period to period, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed. Such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons. We do not currently hedge our net earnings exposure arising from the translation of our foreign revenue and segment operating income (loss). 
 39 

We are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk, as our foreign subsidiaries have certain loans and leases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. As of September 30, 2024, we had long-term contractual liabilities that were denominated in nonfunctional currencies of 46.7 million. As foreign exchange rates fluctuate, these liabilities are remeasured, and the corresponding adjustment is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. 
 On January 4, 2023, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with an effective date of January 31, 2023 to hedge cash flows on 300 million of our SOFR-based borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility. Refer to Note 12 Derivative of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further information. 
 We are exposed to short-term and long-term interest rate risk on certain of our debt obligations. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Refer to Note 21 Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, which information is incorporated by reference herein. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Other than the following risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We may not complete the sale of our GES business in the timeframe or on the terms we anticipate and, even if we do, we may not be able to realize the full strategic, financial, operational and other benefits that are expected to result from the transaction. On October 20, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our GES business to Truelink Capital for 535 million (the GES Sale ), subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses. The completion of the GES Sale and our receipt of the anticipated proceeds therefrom are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: the satisfaction of closing conditions, including the parties obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on such approvals), and the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the sale agreement. These and other factors could impair our ability to complete the GES Sale in the timeframe and on the terms that we anticipate (or at all), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Even if the GES Sale is completed, we may not be able to realize the full strategic, financial, operational and other benefits that are expected to result from the transaction, including the deployment of proceeds from the GES Sale to fund the growth of Pursuit as a standalone company through strategic pipeline investments. Our ability to realize the benefits of the GES Sale may be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the anticipated tax treatment of the transaction may not be obtained; (ii) the potential impact of unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, costs, expenses, earnings, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition and losses on the future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the Company after the consummation of the transaction; (iii) potential litigation relating to the transaction that could be instituted against the Company or its directors; (iv) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the transaction; (v) any negative effects of the announcement, pendency or consummation of the transaction on the market price of our common stock and on our operating results; (vi) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the transaction; (vii) the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm our business, including current plans and operations or by diverting management s attention from the Company s ongoing business operations; and (viii) our ability to retain and hire key personnel and uncertainties arising from leadership changes. In addition, such benefits may be delayed or less significant than anticipated. We cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the GES Sale will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved, or when they will be achieved, if at all. A failure to realize these and other anticipated benefits of the GES Sale or effectively utilize the proceeds from the GES Sale could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Natural disasters, weather conditions, accidents, and other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business. The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes, fires, floods, volcanoes, and earthquakes), acts of war or terrorism, accidents involving our travel offerings or experiences, the effects of climate change, including any impact of global warming, or the prospect of these events could disrupt our business. Changes in climates may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and make certain destinations less desirable. 
 Such catastrophic events have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on Pursuit, which is heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel and/or visit our attractions. Pursuit guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts, and attractions, and catastrophic events and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to such events could impede the guests ability to travel, and interrupt our business operations, including damaging our properties. For example, on July 22, 2024, Jasper National Park was closed and evacuated due to wildfire activity, and a wildfire entered the Jasper townsite on July 24, 2024. All of Pursuit s hotels and attractions in and near the Jasper townsite, as well as our Pyramid Lake Lodge, Miette Mountain Cabins, and Maligne Lake Cruise were not reached by the wildfire and remain intact except for Pursuit s Maligne Canyon Wilderness Kitchen, a restaurant and retail operation located about three miles outside the town of Jasper. We are currently working with our insurance carriers to determine the extent of potential recoveries from our policies. Assessment of the full value of the loss is ongoing. This incident had a negative effect on visitation to our lodging properties in Jasper National Park as well as the Maligne Lake Cruise and the Columbia Icefield attractions (including the Glacier Adventure and Columbia Icefield Skywalk) during the peak 2024 tourist season in Jasper National Park and, depending on the pace and success of recovery and 
 41 

restoration efforts, the incident could continue to have a negative effect on visitation to these properties in 2025. Also, the accident on July 18, 2020, at Pursuit s Glacier Adventure attraction, which involved one of our off-road Ice Explorers and resulted in three fatalities and other serious injuries, may have a negative impact on our reputation and traveler willingness to visit that attraction in the future. 
 Such catastrophic events could also have a negative impact on GES, causing a cancellation or relocation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or disrupt the services we provide to our customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues. Such events could also have a negative impact on GES production facilities, preventing us from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers. In addition, unfavorable media attention, or negative publicity, in the wake of any catastrophic event or accident could damage our reputation or reduce the demand for our services. If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition to other information set forth in this report, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities AND Use of Proceeds 
 The following table summarizes the total number of shares of our common stock that were repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 pursuant to publicly announced plans or programs, as well as certain previously owned shares of common stock that were surrendered by employees, former employees, and non-employee directors for tax withholding requirements on vested share-based awards.
