In the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 , unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities were recognized in income. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is unlikely that it will be required to sell the investments in an unrealized loss position prior to their anticipated recovery.

The Company does not enter into derivatives transactions for trading or speculative purposes. The Company s foreign currency forward contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.

The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023 was million, and million, respectively. The changes in taxes for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, were primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance of million on deferred tax assets for U.S. federal and state purposes during the three months ended October 1, 2023. The Company evaluated the current results as of the period ended September 29, 2024, coupled with the expectations for the remainder of the year, and determined that it continues to not be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, and accordingly, has recorded benefit for the forecasted tax loss for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The future foreign tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition in earnings in countries with tax rates differing from the U.S. federal rate. The Company is under examination in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Due to the uncertain nature of ongoing tax audits, the Company has recorded its liability for uncertain tax positions as part of its long-term liability as payments cannot be anticipated over the next twelve months. The existing tax positions of the Company continue to generate an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions. The liability for uncertain tax positions may be reduced for liabilities that are settled with taxing authorities or on which the statute of limitations could expire without assessment from tax authorities. The possible reduction in liabilities for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions in the next twelve months is approximately million excluding the interest, penalties and the effect of any related deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company is currently under examination in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

of orders are cancelable by giving notice to prior to the expected shipment date and of orders are cancelable by giving notice to prior to the expected shipment date. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had approximately million , as compared to million as of December 31, 2023, in short-term non-cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers or where the suppliers had procured unique materials and components upon receipts of the Company s purchase orders. Due to an elongation of the time from order placement to production that occurred several years ago, the Company issued purchase orders to supply chain partners beyond contractual termination periods. As of September 29, 2024, million of purchase orders beyond contractual termination periods remained outstanding. Consequently, the Company may incur expenses for materials and components, such as chipsets purchased by the supplier to fulfill the purchase order if the purchase order is cancelled. Expenses incurred in respect of cancelled purchase orders have historically not been significant relative to the original order value. For those orders not governed by master purchase agreements, the commitments are governed by the commercial terms on the Company s purchase orders subject to acknowledgment from its suppliers. The Company establishes a loss liability for all products it does not expect to sell or orders it anticipates canceling for which it has committed purchases from suppliers. Such loss liability is included in Other accrued liabilities on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Losses incurred in relation to purchase commitments, including unique materials and components, amounted to a gain of million and a loss of million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 , respectively, and losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Non-Trade Commitments As of September 29, 2024 , the Company had non-cancellable purchase commitments of million pertaining to non-trade activities.

Leases As of September 29, 2024, the Company entered into an office lease that has not yet commenced with short-term and long-term future lease payments of million and million, respectively, that are not yet recorded on the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. This lease will commence in 2025 with a non-cancelable lease term of . Litigation and Other Legal Matters The Company is involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions, including, but not limited to, the matters described below. In all cases, at each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. In such cases, the Company accrues for the amount, or if a range, the Company accrues the low end of the range, only if there is not a better estimate than any other amount within the range, as a component of legal expense within litigation reserves, net. The Company monitors developments in these legal matters that could affect the estimate the Company had previously accrued. In relation to such matters, the Company currently believes that there are existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position within the next , or the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could have an adverse effect in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company s estimates, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses. Huawei v. NETGEAR Inc., NETGEAR Deutschland GmbH, and Exertis-Connect GmbH (at the Dusseldorf District Court, Germany) On or around March of 2022, Huawei filed patent infringement lawsuits at the District Court of Dusseldorf, Germany, against NETGEAR Inc., NETGEAR Deutschland GmbH, and Exertis-Connect GmbH, a third-party webstore selling NETGEAR products in Germany. Huawei asserted one EU patent in each suit, EP 3 337 077 B1 EP 077 in case no. 08/22 and EP 3 143 741 B1 (EP 741) in case no. 09/22. In its complaints, Huawei alleged that the Company s WiFi 6 products infringed the patents, which Huawei further claimed are standard-essential patents. On or around February 9, 2023, the Federal Patent Court issued preliminary opinions finding both asserted patents invalid. The Company attended an oral hearing for both infringement cases on March 21, 2023 before the Dusseldorf District Court and the Court dismissed case no. 09/22 for the EP 741 and stayed case no. 08/22 for EP 077. Huawei is appealing the dismissal of case no. 09/22, and the deadline for the parties briefing is scheduled for November 22, 2024 with an oral hearing on March 6, 2025. On March 20, 2024, the Patent Court maintained the validity of EP 741, but with an amended claim. Case no. 08/22 (EP 077) remains stayed while the nullity action is ongoing.

 segments: NETGEAR for Business and Connected Home: NETGEAR for Business: Focuses on businesses and provides solutions for business networking, wireless local area network LAN ), audio and video over Ethernet for Pro AV applications, security and remote management providing enterprise-class functionality at an affordable price; and 

 Connected Home: Focuses on consumers and provides high-performance, dependable and easy-to-use premium WiFi internet networking solutions such as WiFi 6, WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 Tri-band and Quad-band mesh systems, and routers, 4G/5G mobile products, and subscription services that provide consumers a range of value-added services focused on performance, security, privacy, and premium support. 

 The Company believes that this structure reflects its current operational and financial management, and that it provides the best structure for the Company to focus on growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. The leadership team of each segment is focused on product and service development efforts, both from a product marketing and engineering standpoint, to service the unique needs of their customers. The results of the reportable segments are derived directly from the Company s management reporting system. The results are based on the Company s method of internal reporting and are not necessarily in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including contribution income (loss). Segment contribution income (loss) includes all product line segment revenues less the related cost of sales, research and development and sales and marketing costs. Contribution income (loss) is used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of the segments. Certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level. These unallocated indirect costs include corporate costs, such as corporate research and development, corporate marketing and general and administrative expenses,

The Company s investments in U.S. treasury securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued based on readily available pricing sources for comparable or identical instruments in less active markets. The Company s investments in convertible debt securities issued by a publicly held company are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value for the instrument approximates its cost based on the contractual terms of the arrangement. The Company s foreign currency forward contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using pricing models that consider the contract terms as well as currency rates and counterparty credit rates. The Company verifies the reasonableness of these pricing models using observable market data for related inputs into such models. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with only those counterparties that have long-term credit ratings of A-/A3 or higher.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this quarterly report. Unless expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms we, our, us and NETGEAR refer to NETGEAR, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 Business and Executive Overview 
 We are a global company that turns ideas into innovative, high-performance, and premium networking products. Our products power businesses and service providers and connect people. Our products are designed to simplify and improve people s lives. Our strategy for NETGEAR for Business segment is to innovate manufacturing partner integrations, to deploy our products in businesses of all sizes, as well as to capitalize on our product leadership position to pursue new and adjacent verticals, such as to expand our reach into the broadcast industry. Our strategy for Connected Home segment is to develop products to serve a broader segment of the consumer networking market, to evolve our marketing messaging to highlight our points of differentiation, as well as to leverage our position and independence to forge value-added partnerships that drive innovation and improve the experience for our customers. Our goal is to enable businesses and people to collaborate and connect to a world of information and entertainment in or outside of the home. We are dedicated to delivering innovative and highly differentiated, connected solutions ranging from switching and wireless solutions to augment business networks and audio and video over Ethernet for Pro AV applications, to easy-to-use premium WiFi solutions, security and support services to protect and enhance home networks. Our products and services are built on a variety of technologies such as wireless (WiFi and 4G/5G mobile), Ethernet and powerline, with a focus on reliability and ease-of-use. Additionally, we continually invest in 
 27 

Table of Contents 

research and development to create new technologies and services and to capitalize on technological inflection points and trends, such as audio and video over Ethernet, multi-Gigabit internet service to homes, WiFi 7, and future technologies. Our product line consists of devices that create and extend wired and wireless networks, as well as services that complement and enhance our product line offerings. These products are available in multiple configurations to address the changing needs of our customers in each geographic region. 
 
 We operate and report in two segments: NETGEAR for Business (formerly known as Small and Medium Business, or SMB) and Connected Home. We believe that this structure reflects our current operational and financial management, and that it provides the best structure for us to focus on growth opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. The leadership team of each segment is focused on serving customer needs through product and service development efforts, both from a product marketing and engineering standpoint. The NETGEAR for Business segment focuses on businesses and provides solutions for business networking, wireless local area network LAN ), audio and video over Ethernet for Pro AV applications, security and remote management providing enterprise-class functionality at an affordable price. The Connected Home segment focuses on consumers and provides high-performance, dependable, and easy-to-use premium WiFi internet networking solutions such as WiFi 6, WiFi 6E, and WiFi 7 Tri-band and Quad-band mesh systems, 4G/5G mobile products, and subscription services that provide consumers a range of value-added services focused on security, performance, privacy, and premium support. We conduct business across three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa EMEA and Asia Pacific APAC ). 
 Business Overview 
 
 The markets in which our segments operate are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological evolution. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the business, consumer, and service provider markets for networking products include product breadth, price points, size and scope of the sales channel, brand name, timeliness of new product introductions, product availability, performance, features, functionality, reliability, ease-of-installation, maintenance and use, security, as well as customer service and support. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to aggressively invest resources to develop new products and subscription services, enhance our current products, and expand our channels and direct-to-consumer capabilities, while increasing engagement and maintaining satisfaction with our customers. Our investments reflect our steadfast focus on cybersecurity of our products and systems, as the rising threat of cyber-attacks and exploitation of security vulnerabilities in our industry is a significant consumer concern. 
 
 We sell our products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including traditional and online retailers, wholesale distributors, direct market resellers DMRs ), value-added resellers VARs ), broadband service providers, and through our direct online store at www.netgear.com . Our retail channel includes traditional and online retail locations both domestically and internationally, such as Amazon.com (worldwide), Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Costco, Staples, Office Depot, Target, Electra (Sweden), Fnac Darty (Europe), JB HiFi (Australia), Elkjop (Norway), and Boulanger (France). Our DMRs include CDW Corporation, Insight Corporation, and PC Connection in domestic markets. Our main wholesale distributors include Ingram Micro, TD Synnex, and D H Distribution Company. In addition, we also sell our products through broadband service providers, such as multiple system operators, xDSL, mobile, and other broadband technology operators domestically and internationally. Some of these retailers and broadband service providers purchase directly from us, while others are fulfilled through wholesale distributors around the world. A substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from a limited number of wholesale distributors, service providers and retailers. While we expect these channels to continue to be a significant part of our sales strategy, increasingly, customers are choosing to purchase products and services directly from us. We expect revenue through our direct online store or in-app offerings to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue for the foreseeable future. 
 Financial Overview 
 During the three months ended September 29, 2024, our net revenue decreased by 15.0 million, compared to the prior year period, mainly driven by a decrease of 23.0 million in our Connected Home segment, partially offset by an increase of 8.0 million in our NETGEAR for Business segment. The decrease in Connected Home net revenue was in part due to market contraction, leading to a year-over-year decline in the retail channel, and a decline in net revenue in service provider channel. The increase in NETGEAR for Business net revenue was primarily due to the completion of our work with our channel partners to optimize their inventory levels and starting to see more predictable performance aligned to the market, led by the higher net revenue from the Pro AV product line of managed switches. Despite the decline in net revenue during the three months ended September 29, 2024, our premium portfolio of products continued to outperform the market. We also experienced continued strong demand for the Pro AV product line of managed switches, and growth in our services revenue. Our gross margin percentage decreased 390 basis points during the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to higher freight costs, and cost of inventory, partially offset by higher mix of NETGEAR for Business products, which generally carry higher gross margin. Income from operations increased by 96.5 million during the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to the payment received from the litigation settlement with TP-Link, leading to a contra-expense of 92.7 million in the litigation reserves, the reversal of an 
 28 

Table of Contents 

8.2 million contingent fee recorded in litigation reserves in the prior quarter, and a reduction of 10.9 million in general and administrative expenses to offset the related legal fees incurred to date. The increase of income from operations was partially offset by lower net revenue. 
 Geographically, net revenue increased from NETGEAR for Business in Americas and APAC but decreased in EMEA, whereas net revenue decreased from Connected Home in all three regions, during the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, respectively. 
 Global Events Affecting our Business and Operations 
 Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends created uncertainty in the global economic environment since 2022. These include conditions such as the potential for a recession, fluctuations in inflation, interest rate changes, and the related negative impact on the global economy, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, particularly changes of the U.S. dollar, and ongoing worldwide tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Hamas conflict, and Red Sea crisis. The extent of impacts from these macroeconomic and geopolitical trends on our ongoing operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments. The broader implications of the macroeconomic uncertainty, and any related disruptions to channel partners and freight are unpredictable. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for various risks and uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic trends and uncertainty. 
 
 During the first half of 2024, we completed efforts to work with our channel partners to optimize their inventory carrying levels for both the NETGEAR for Business and Connected Home businesses and started to see more predictable performance aligned to the market in the three months ended September 29, 2024, which we expect to continue to see in the periods ahead. Looking forward, we will continue to reduce our slower moving inventory levels and expect to return to our historically normal inventory costs after we reach our target inventory levels of three months, and when transportation costs return to normal from their heightened levels partially as a result of the Red Sea crisis. We expect to experience continued net revenue growth in our NETGEAR For Business segment, led by our ProAV line of managed switches, and while we are seeing the signs of market recovery, we expect increased promotional activity in the Connected Home retail business due in part to the holiday promotional period. Accordingly, we expect the net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be in the range of 160 million to 175 million, including 20 million from the service provider channels. We aim to execute on our strategy of capitalizing on the technological inflection points of audio and video over Ethernet, WiFi 7, WiFi 6E, WiFi 6, and 5G, to develop products that serve a broader segment of the market with a good, better, best product strategy, and to simplify, develop and roll out service offerings that build recurring service revenue streams. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income, and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We base these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. As of the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 For a complete description of what we believe to be the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, refer to Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report.

Net Revenue by Geographic Region 
 Our net revenue consists of gross product shipments and service revenue, less allowances for estimated sales returns, price protection, end-user customer rebates and other channel sales incentives deemed to be a reduction of revenue per the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition, and net changes in deferred revenue. 
 For reporting purposes, revenue is generally attributed to each geographic region based upon the location of the customer.

Americas 
 Net revenue in Americas decreased in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, driven by declines in Connected Home segment s net revenue of 18.1 and 13.7 , respectively, and in NETGEAR for Business segment s net revenue of 8.8 in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods. The declines in Connected Home net revenue were primarily due to market contraction, leading to year-over-year declines in the retail channel in both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, and a decline in the service provider channel in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, respectively. The decline in NETGEAR for Business net revenue in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was mainly due to our work with our channel partners in the first half of 2024 to optimize their inventory carrying levels. The decline in net revenue in Americas in the three months ended September 29, 2024 was partially offset by an increase in NETGEAR for Business segment s net revenue of 15.7 , mainly driven by higher demand

for the Pro AV product line of managed switches, compared to the prior year period. 
 EMEA 
 
 Net revenue in EMEA decreased in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, driven by declines in NETGEAR for Business segment s net revenue of 7.3 and 15.9 , respectively, and in Connected Home segment s net revenue of 9.9 and 21.8 , respectively. The net revenue decline in NETGEAR for Business segment in the three months ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to the lower net revenue from our traditional transactional switches, whereas the decline in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was mainly driven by our work with our channel partners to optimize their inventory carrying levels in the first half of 2024. The net revenue declines in Connected Home segment were mainly due to market contraction, leading to year-over-year declines in the retail channel in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods. 
 
 APAC 
 Net revenue in APAC increased in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, mainly driven by increases in NETGEAR for Business segment s net revenue of 43.9 and 16.3 , respectively, primarily attributable to the higher demand for the Pro AV product line of managed switches. 
 For further discussions specific to our NETGEAR for Business and Connected Home segments, refer to the " Segment Information " section below. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of the following: the cost of finished products from our third party manufacturers; overhead costs, including purchasing, product planning, inventory control, warehousing and distribution logistics; third-party software licensing fees; inbound freight; import duties/tariffs; warranty costs associated with returned goods; write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory; amortization of certain acquired intangibles and software development costs; and costs attributable to the provision of service offerings. 
 We outsource our manufacturing, warehousing and distribution logistics. We believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin. Our gross margin can be affected by a number of factors, including fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, sales returns, changes in average selling prices, end-user customer rebates and other channel sales incentives, changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations and increases in prices paid for components, net of vendor rebates, royalty and licensing fees, warranty and overhead costs, inbound freight and duty/tariffs, conversion costs, charges for excess or obsolete inventory, amortization of acquired intangibles and capitalized software development costs.

Our gross margin percentage decreased for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, primarily attributable to higher cost of inventory and freight costs, partially offset by higher mix of NETGEAR for Business products, which generally carry higher gross margin. Our gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was also negatively impacted by higher excess and obsolete inventory expense as we accelerated the depletion of our slower moving inventory. 
 We expect our gross margin in the fourth fiscal quarter to be in line with or decrease slightly from the third fiscal quarter of 2024 level. Forecasting gross margin percentages is difficult, and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels. Our cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue can vary significantly based upon factors such as: uncertainties surrounding revenue levels, broad-based inflationary pressures and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, future pricing and/or potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in our international markets, competition, the timing of sales, and related production level variances; import customs duties and imposed tariffs; changes in technology; changes in product mix; expenses associated with writing off excessive or obsolete inventory; variability of stock-based compensation costs; royalties to third parties; fluctuations 
 31 

Table of Contents 

in freight costs; manufacturing and purchase price variances; changes in prices on commodity components; and warranty costs. We expect that revenue derived from paid subscription service plans will continue to increase in the future, which may have a positive impact on our gross margin. However, we will continue to experience fluctuations in our gross margin due to the factors discussed above. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, payments to suppliers for design services, safety and regulatory testing, product certification expenditures to qualify our products for sale into specific markets, prototypes, IT and facility allocations, and other consulting fees. Research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred. Our research and development organization is focused on enhancing our ability to introduce innovative and easy-to-use products and services.

Research and development expenses remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, with the increase of 1.2 million in personnel related expenditures, mainly attributable to higher variable compensation, primarily offset by the decreases of 0.7 million in IT and facility allocation and 0.4 million in engineering projects and outside professional services. Research and development expenses declined for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by decreases in engineering projects and outside professional services of 1.6 million, and in IT and facility allocations of 1.1 million. 
 We believe that innovation and technological leadership is critical to our future success, and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies, products and services. We expect research and development expenses in absolute dollar amount in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be in line with the third fiscal quarter of 2024 level. We continue to invest in research and development to grow audio and video over Ethernet, web-managed, AV over IP managed switches, NETGEAR for Business wireless products, our cloud platform capabilities, our recurring services and mobile applications and to create and expand our hardware product offerings focused on premium WiFi 7, and WiFi 6/6E, Advanced 4G/5G mobile and 5G coverage solutions. Research and development expenses may fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development activities and could vary significantly as a percentage of net revenue, depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, trade shows, corporate communications and other marketing expenses, product marketing expenses, outbound freight costs, amortization of certain intangibles, personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff, technical support expenses, and IT and facility allocations.

Sales and marketing expenses increased slightly for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, with an increase in variable personal compensation of 1.2 million primarily offset by a decrease in brand marketing expenditures of 1.1 million. Sales and marketing expenses declined for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to decreases in brand marketing expenditures of 4.4 million, and in personnel-related expenditures of 1.2 million, primarily due to lower headcount and partially offset by higher variable compensation. 
 We expect sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amount in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be slightly up from the third fiscal quarter of 2024 level as we look to make some investments in sales resources in support of our NETGEAR for Business segment. Expenses may fluctuate depending on revenue levels achieved as certain expenses, such as commissions, are determined based upon the revenues achieved. Forecasting sales and marketing expenses is highly dependent on expected

revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenue achieved in any given quarter. Marketing expenses may also fluctuate depending upon the timing, extent and nature of marketing programs. Marketing expenditure committed with a customer is generally recorded as a reduction of revenue per authoritative guidance. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executives, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, professional fees, including legal costs associated with defending claims against us, allowance for doubtful accounts, IT and facility allocations, and other general corporate expenses.

The decreases in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, were primarily attributable to a 10.9 million reduction in expenses to offset the legal fees incurred to date associated with the litigation settlement payment from TP-Link. The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 were partially offset by increases in personnel-related expenditures of 3.3 million and 7.7 million, respectively, mainly due to higher variable compensation, and stock-based compensation associated with executives transition. 
 
 We expect general and administration expenses in absolute dollar amount in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 to be in line with or slightly lower than the second fiscal quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower litigation defense costs. General and administrative expenses could fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including the level and timing of expenditures associated with litigation defense costs in connection with the litigation matters described in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs, including legal costs associated with defending claims against us, as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors.

 The changes in taxes for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, were primarily due to the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for U.S. federal and state purposes that was established during the period ended October 1, 2023. We evaluated the current results as of the period ended September 29, 2024, coupled with the expectations for the remainder of the year, and determined that it continues to not be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, and accordingly, did not record any benefits for the forecasted tax loss in for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future foreign tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition in earnings in countries with tax rates differing from the U.S. federal rate. We are under examination in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 
 Segment Information 
 In the first fiscal quarter of 2024, resulting from certain segment structure changes, we revised our allocation method by allocating certain historically unallocated operating expenses to our individual operating segments. The prior-year segment financial information has been recast to conform to the current-year presentation. Additional information on the change, a description of our products and services, as well as segment financial data, for each segment and a reconciliation of segment contribution income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes can be found in Note 11, Segment Information , and information on net revenue by sales channels can be found in Disaggregation of Revenue in Note 3, Revenue , in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

NETGEAR for Business net revenue increased, in the three months ended September 29, 2024, primarily due to the completion of our work with our channel partners to optimize their inventory levels and starting to see more predictable performance aligned to the market, led by the higher net revenue from the Pro AV product line of managed switches. NETGEAR for Business net revenue decreased, in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, primarily due to our work with our channel partners to optimize their inventory carrying levels in the first half of 2024, compared to the prior year period. We continued to experience strong demand for the Pro AV product line of managed switches. Geographically, NETGEAR for Business net revenue increased in Americas and APAC but decreased in EMEA, in the three months ended September 29, 2024, whereas net revenue decreased in EMEA and Americas but increased in APAC, in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, respectively.

 Connected Home net revenue decreased in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, in part due to market contraction, leading to year-over-year declines in the retail channel, and a decline in net revenue in service provider channel. Despite the declines in the overall consumer networking market during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, our premium portfolio of products continued to outperform the market, and we saw growth in our service revenue, as compared to the prior year periods. Geographically, Connected Home net revenue decreased in all three regions in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods. 
 Connected Home contribution loss increased in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year periods, mainly attributable to lower net revenue, and lower gross margin achievements due to higher freight costs, higher cost of inventory, and higher excess and obsolete inventory expense as we accelerated the depletion of our slower moving inventory. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations. As of September 29, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of 395.7 million, an increase of 112.1 million from December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 29, 2024, approximately 22 of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were outside of the U.S., which are subject to fluctuation based on the settlement of intercompany balances. As we repatriate these funds in accordance with our designation of funds not permanently reinvested outside of the U.S., we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes during the period when such repatriation occurs. We have recorded deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.

Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 142.7 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a net proceed before tax of 103.6 million resulting from the litigation settlement payment from TP-Link and other favorable working capital movements. Our accounts payable (excluding payables related to property and equipment) increased from 46.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to 50.9 million as of September 29, 2024, primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and supplier payments. Accounts receivable decreased from 185.1 million as of December 31, 2023 to 177.3 million as of September 29, 2024, primarily due to the timing of cash collections and lower revenue. Inventory decreased from 248.9 million as of December 31, 2023 to 162.0 million as of September 29, 2024. We expect to continue generating cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as we continue to reduce our slower moving inventory levels. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 7.4 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the prior year period, mainly driven by higher net purchases of short-term investments and higher purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 22.4 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 0.8 million in the prior year period, primarily due to repurchases of our common stock in the current year period. 
 Based on our current plans and market conditions, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term and long-term. However, we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes, such as acquisitions, and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that, if available, such financing would be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive. Our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized programs under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock. Under the authorizations, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions and the price of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased and retired, reported based on trade date, approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock, at a cost of approximately 22.9 million under the repurchase authorization. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the nine months ended October 1, 2023. On July 16, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock, incremental to the remaining shares under our previous repurchase program. As of September 29, 2024, approximately 3.8 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. We also repurchased and retired, reported based on trade date, approximately 222,000 shares and 194,000 shares of common stock, at a cost of approximately 3.3 million and 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, to administratively facilitate the withholding and subsequent remittance of personal income and payroll taxes for individuals receiving Restricted Stock Units. For a detailed discussion of our common stock repurchases, refer to Note 9,

 Except as follows, there were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations as of September 29, 2024, from those as of December 31, 2023, disclosed in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had 84.9 million of purchase obligations which represented short-term non-cancellable inventory-related purchase agreements with suppliers, as compared to 42.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Due to an elongation of the time from order placement to production that occurred several years ago, we issued purchase orders to supply chain partners beyond contractual termination periods. As of September 29, 2024, 204.1 million of purchase orders beyond contractual termination periods remained outstanding. These purchase orders may be cancelled by either party, however we may incur expenses for materials and components, such as chipsets purchased by the supplier to fulfill the purchase order, in the event of cancellation. Expenses incurred in respect of cancelled purchase orders have historically not been significant relative to the original order value. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we entered into an office lease that has not yet commenced with short-term and long-term future lease payments of 0.3 million and 43.0 million, respectively, that are not yet recorded on our unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. This lease will commence in 2025 with a non-cancelable lease term of 11 years.

 Risk Factors Summary 
 
 The following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, some of which either have occurred or may occur in the future, that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below. 
 
 Risks Related to our Business, Industry and Operations 
 
 Optimizing our channel partners' inventory levels and product mix within the current environment is challenging, and we have, and may in the future, incur costs associated with excess inventory, or lose sales from having too few products. 

To remain competitive and stimulate consumer and business demand, we must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions of products and services. 

Investment in new business strategies could disrupt our ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. 

We rely on a limited number of traditional and online retailers, wholesale distributors and service provider customers for a substantial portion of our sales, and our net revenue could decline if they refuse to pay our requested prices or reduce their level of purchases, if there are unforeseen disruptions in their businesses, or if there is significant consolidation in our customer base that results in fewer customers for our products. 

We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources. 

Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses. 

We depend substantially on our sales channels, and our failure to maintain and expand our sales channels would result in lower sales and reduced net revenue. 

We depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing needs. 

Our sales and operations in international markets have exposed us to and may in the future expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks. 

We depend on large, recurring purchases from certain significant customers, and a loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively affect our revenue. 

The average selling prices of our products typically decrease rapidly over the sales cycle of the product, which may negatively affect our net revenue and gross margins. 

If we fail to overcome the challenges associated with managing our broadband service provider sales channel, our net revenue and gross profit will be negatively impacted. 

We expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.

Changes in trade policy in the United States and other countries may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

If disruptions in our transportation network continue to occur or our shipping costs substantially increase, we may be unable to sell or timely deliver our products, and our net revenue and gross margin could decrease. 

Expansion of our operations and infrastructure may strain our operations and increase our operating expenses. 

As part of growing our business, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business and operating results could be harmed and our stock price could decline. 

We invest in companies primarily for strategic reasons but may not realize a return on our investments. 

Risks Related to Our Products, Technology and Intellectual Property 
 We rely upon third parties for technology that is critical to our products, and if we are unable to continue to use this technology and future technology, our ability to develop, sell, maintain and support technologically innovative products would be limited. 

Product security vulnerabilities, system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and improper use of artificial intelligence AI tools, could disrupt our products, services, internal operations or information technology systems, and any such disruption could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely affect our stock price. 

If we are unable to successfully leverage AI technology to automate and drive efficiencies in our operations and products and services, our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 

We make substantial investments in software research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If our products contain defects or errors, we could incur significant unexpected expenses, experience product returns and lost sales, experience product recalls, suffer damage to our brand and reputation, and be subject to product liability or other claims. 

Our user growth, engagement, and monetization of our subscription services depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control. 

If we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be harmed. 

Financial, Legal, Regulatory and Tax Compliance Risks, Including Recent Impairment Charges 
 We are currently involved in litigation matters and may in the future become involved in additional litigation. 

We have been exposed to and may in the future be exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could harm our financial results and cash flows. 

We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets. 

Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our future profitability. 

We are subject to, and must remain in compliance with numerous new, existing and changing laws and regulations worldwide. 

We must comply with indirect tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, as well as complex customs duty regimes worldwide. Audits of our compliance with these rules may result in additional liabilities for taxes, duties, interest and penalties related to our international operations which would reduce our profitability. 

We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio. 

Governmental regulations of imports or exports affecting Internet security could affect our net revenue. 

If our goodwill becomes impaired, as occurred in 2022, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.

 We have marked with an asterisk ) those risks described below that reflect substantive changes from the risks described under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2024. 
 
 Risks Related to our Business, Industry and Operations 
 
 Optimizing our channel partners' inventory levels and product mix within the current environment is challenging, and we have, and may in the future, incur costs associated with excess inventory, or lose sales from having too few products. 
 
 If we are unable to properly monitor and optimize our channel partners' inventory levels and maintain an appropriate level and mix of products with our retail partners and wholesale distributors and within our sales channels, we may incur increased and unexpected costs associated with this inventory. In 2022 and the first half of 2023, many of our retail and service provider partners began significantly reducing their target inventory levels which adversely affected our results of operations. While we see signs of the retail networking market stabilizing, the uncertain macroeconomic environment and high inflation and interest rates are also putting pressure on our NETGEAR for Business channel partners. We have experienced and continue to experience lower revenue as a result of our channel partners lowering their inventory levels and higher cost of carrying excess channel inventory. On the other hand, low channel inventory levels increase the likelihood that our sales channel customers may not be able to fulfill end user demand, leading to delayed or lost sales, unhappy customers and potential impacts to our brand and reputation. Inadequate stock levels could also hinder our ability to fulfill large orders or take advantage of unexpected demand spikes, thereby limiting revenue growth opportunities. Moreover, reductions in target inventory levels put pressure on our ability to accurately forecast customer demand and inventory requirements and increases the likelihood that the accuracy of such forecasts would be lower. We determine production levels based on our forecasts of demand for our products. Actual demand for our products depends on many factors, which makes it difficult to forecast. We have experienced differences 
 41 

Table of Contents 

between our actual and our forecasted demand in the past and expect differences to arise in the future. If we improperly forecast demand for our products and channel inventory levels, we could end up with too many products and be unable to sell the excess inventory in a timely manner, if at all, or, alternatively we could end up with too few products and not be able to satisfy demand. This problem is exacerbated because we attempt to closely match inventory levels with product demand leaving limited margin for error. Also, during the transition from an existing product to a new replacement product, we must accurately predict the demand for the existing and the new product. If we improperly forecast demand for our products and channel inventory levels, we could incur increased expenses associated with writing off excessive or obsolete inventory, lose sales, incur penalties for late delivery or have to ship products by air freight to meet immediate demand incurring incremental freight costs above the sea freight costs and suffering a corresponding decline in gross margins. For example, when demand for our Connected Home products turned out to be lower than we previously forecasted, it had resulted in our revenue for our Connected Home products to come in lower than expected, as our channel partners in the U.S. replenished inventory slower than they sold through to end users to right size their inventory carrying position based on the lower demand levels than were previously expected. In addition, we generally allow wholesale distributors and traditional retailers to return a limited amount of our products in exchange for other products. Under our price protection policy, if we reduce the list price of a product, we are often required to issue a credit in an amount equal to the reduction for each of the products held in inventory by our wholesale distributors and retailers. If our wholesale distributors and retailers are unable to sell their inventory in a timely manner, we might lower the price of the products, or these parties may exchange the products for newer products or decrease their purchases of our products in subsequent periods, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 
 
 To remain competitive and stimulate consumer and business demand, we must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions of products and services. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire and introduce new products and services, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer and business demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends in the consumer, business and service provider markets, and to quickly develop or acquire, manufacture and market and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner. In order to differentiate our products from our competitors products, we must continue to increase our focus and capital investment in research and development and marketing and sales, including software development for our products and complementary services and applications. For example, we previously made a strategic shift to focus on premium, higher margin products and have committed a substantial amount of resources to the development, manufacture, branding, marketing and sale of our Nighthawk mobile hotspot products, Orbi WiFi systems and Pro AV managed switches, and to introducing additional and improved models and services in these lines. In the third quarter of 2023, we launched our first WiFi 7 products, namely the Orbi 97X mesh system and the Nighthawk RS700 router, and will continue to invest in a strong pipeline of WiFi 7 introductions in 2024 across all our major product lines. The success of new products and services depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development either through rapid innovation or acquisition, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks and costs, such as investment costs and marketing costs, associated with development and introduction of new products and services, the effective management of purchase commitments and channel inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, the risk that new products and services may have delays, quality or other defects or deficiencies and our ability to effectively manage marketing and reviews of our products and services. 
 
 In addition, we have acquired companies and technologies in the past and as a result, have introduced new product lines in new markets. We may not be able to successfully manage integration of the new product lines with our existing products. Selling new product lines in new markets will require our management to learn different strategies in order to be successful. We may be unsuccessful in launching a newly acquired product line in new markets which requires management of new suppliers, potential new customers and new business models. Our management may not have the experience of selling in these new markets and we may not be able to grow our business as planned. If we are unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product lines, we may not be able to increase or maintain our sales and our gross margins may be adversely affected. 
 
 Accordingly, if we cannot properly drive customer and business demand, manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, this could result in: 
 loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share; 

negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand; 

a decline in the average selling price of our products; 

42 

Table of Contents 

adverse reactions in our sales channels, such as reduced shelf space, reduced channel inventory levels, reduced online product visibility, or loss of sales channels; and 

increased levels of product returns. 

In addition, if we are unable to successfully introduce or acquire new products with higher gross margins, or enhance and improve our services and subscription offerings for customer retention or service revenue growth, or if we are unable to improve the margins on our previously introduced and rapidly growing product and services lines, our net revenue and overall gross margin would likely decline. 
 
 Investment in new business strategies could disrupt our ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies and adjust existing business strategies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, legal and regulatory challenges, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Changes in business strategies are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. For example, as mentioned in the risk factor above To remain competitive and stimulate consumer and business demand, we must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions of products and services , we previously made a strategic shift to focus on premium, higher margin products and services and we continue to make changes in our business strategies, including pursuing new, adjacent markets. Changes in business strategy would require us to hire in key areas and make certain investments, including marketing; however, such investments may not prove to be successful. Additionally, a significant part of our business strategy and culture is to focus on long-term growth and as a result, our profitability may be lower than it would be if our strategy were to maximize short-term financial results. If we are ultimately unable to improve profitability at the level or during the time frame anticipated by securities or industry analysts and our stockholders, the trading price of our common stock may decline. If we fail to develop and successfully execute on our business strategies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 We rely on a limited number of traditional and online retailers, wholesale distributors and service provider customers for a substantial portion of our sales, and our net revenue could decline if they refuse to pay our requested prices or reduce their level of purchases, if there are unforeseen disruptions in their businesses, or if there is significant consolidation in our customer base that results in fewer customers for our products. 
 
 We sell a substantial portion of our products through traditional and online retailers, including Best Buy Co., Inc., Amazon.com, Inc. and their affiliates, wholesale distributors, including Ingram Micro, Inc. and TD Synnex, and service providers, such as AT T. We expect that a significant portion of our net revenue will continue to come from sales to a small number of customers for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our accounts receivable are often concentrated with a small group of purchasers, the failure of any of them to pay on a timely basis, or at all, would reduce our cash flow. We are also exposed to increased credit risk if any one of these limited numbers of customers fails or becomes insolvent. We generally have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these customers. These purchasers could decide at any time to discontinue, decrease or delay their purchases of our products. If our customers increase the size of their product orders without sufficient lead-time for us to process the order, our ability to fulfill product demands would be compromised. These customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Accordingly, the prices that they pay for our products are subject to negotiation and could change at any time. For example, as mentioned below in the risk factors If disruptions in our transportation network continue to occur or our shipping costs substantially increase again in the future, we may be unable to sell or timely deliver our products, and net revenue and our gross margin could decrease and We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources, and if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements or we are unable to properly manage our supply requirements with our third-party manufacturers, we may lose sales and experience increased component costs , we had previously experienced high freight costs and component costs and had issued price increases to our customers. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. If any of our major customers reduce their level of purchases or refuse to pay the prices that we set for our products, our net revenue and operating results could be harmed. 
 
 Furthermore, some of our customers are also our competitors in certain product categories, which could negatively influence their purchasing decisions. For example, Amazon owns Eero, one of our competitors in the mesh WiFi systems product category. Our traditional retail customers have faced increased and significant competition from online retailers, and some of these traditional retail customers have increasingly become a smaller portion of our business. If key retail customers continue 
 43 

Table of Contents 

to reduce their level of purchases, our business could be harmed. Similarly, we sell products and services directly to consumers from our own e-commerce platforms and expect these revenues to grow proportionate to overall revenue. Some of our customers, such as Amazon and Best Buy, may consider this to be competitive with their own businesses, which could negatively influence their purchasing decisions with respect to our products. Furthermore, we have experienced a shift towards products being bought and sold online. If we are unable to adjust to this shift and effectively manage our business and inventory requirements amongst our online customers and traditional retail customers, this may lead to lower market share and lower revenues for us, and our net revenue and operating results could be harmed. 
 
 In addition, adverse changes in economic conditions or unforeseen disruptions in the businesses of any of our key customers could adversely impact the sale of our products to end users and the quantity of products our customers decide to purchase from us. For example, as mentioned above in the risk factor Accurately managing our sales channel inventory and product mix within the current environment is challenging, and we have, and may in the future, incur costs associated with excess inventory, or lose sales from having too few products, many of our retail and service provider customers have and continue to reduce their target inventory levels. This shift may have a longer-term impact on the inventory levels our customers choose to carry. 
 
 Additionally, concentration and consolidation among our customer base may allow certain customers to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our profitability. If, as a result of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products, elimination of sales opportunities, replacement of our products with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which would harm our operating results. Consolidation among our service provider customers worldwide may also make it more difficult to grow our service provider business, given the fierce competition for the already limited number of service providers worldwide and the long sales cycles to close deals. If consolidation among our customer base becomes more prevalent, our operating results may be harmed. 
 
 We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources, and if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements or we are unable to properly manage our supply requirements with our third-party manufacturers, we may lose sales and experience increased component costs. 
 
 Any shortage or delay in the supply of key product components, or any sudden, unforeseen price increase for such components, would harm our ability to meet product deliveries as scheduled or as budgeted. Many of the semiconductors used in our products are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis. In addition, some components that are used in all our products are obtained from limited sources. We also obtain switching fabric semiconductors, which are used in our Ethernet switches and Internet gateway products, and WiFi chipsets, which are used in all of our wireless products, from a limited number of suppliers. We also use Cable Modem chipsets and Mobile chipsets in our cable and mobile products. Semiconductor suppliers have experienced and continue to experience component shortages themselves, such as with lead-frames and substrates used in manufacturing chipsets, which in turn adversely impact our ability to procure semiconductors from them in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner. For example, we had previously experienced certain chipset shortages for some of our switching products from two of our semiconductor suppliers who did not have enough wafer capacity to satisfy our demand, and this shortage continued for several quarters. Our third-party manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis, and we do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. If demand for a specific component increases, we may not be able to obtain an adequate number of that component in a timely manner, and prices to obtain such components may increase. In addition, if worldwide demand for the components increases significantly, the availability of these components could be limited and prices for such components may increase. For example, as the demand for Artificial Intelligence chips increase, semiconductor production capacity may be shifted to these specific components thereby constraining supply of or increasing cost on chips used in our products. Further, dependence on a sole source for certain key components of our products may allow such sole source suppliers to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our profitability. As a result, we may be left with little choice but to accept such higher prices or other fees for key components in order to ensure continuity of supply. This could affect our profitability or if we choose to push back against more onerous terms, could lead to inadequate supply, which could materially adversely affect our business. Our suppliers may also experience financial or other difficulties as a result of uncertain and weak worldwide economic, geopolitical conditions, trade disputes or public health issues. Other factors which may affect our suppliers ability or willingness to supply components to us include internal management product allocation decisions or reorganizational issues, such as roll-out of new equipment or disruptions to information infrastructure or power transmission or navigation miscalculations which may delay or disrupt supply of previously forecasted components, or industry consolidation and divestitures, which may result in changed business and product priorities among certain suppliers. Also, many standardized components used broadly in electronic devices are manufactured in significant quantities in concentrated 
 44 

Table of Contents 

geographic regions, particularly in Greater China. As a result, protracted crises, geopolitical unrest and uncertain economic conditions, could lead to eventual shortages of necessary components sourced from impacted regions or increased component costs. Additionally, government intervention to curb the consumption of electricity in China could have a disruptive impact on component production and supply availability. It could be difficult, costly and time consuming to obtain alternative sources for these components, or to change product designs to make use of alternative components. In addition, difficulties in transitioning from an existing supplier to a new supplier could create delays in component availability that would have a significant impact on our ability to fulfill orders for our products. 
 
 We provide our third-party manufacturers with a rolling forecast of demand and purchase orders, which they use to determine our material and component requirements. Lead times for ordering materials and components vary significantly and depend on various factors, such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand and supply for a component at a given time. Some of our components have long lead times, such as WiFi chipsets, switching fabric chips, physical layer transceivers, and logic, power, analog and RF chipsets. If our forecasts are not timely provided or are less than our actual requirements, our third-party manufacturers may be unable to manufacture products in a timely manner. If our forecasts are too high, our third-party manufacturers will be unable to use the components they have purchased on our behalf. Historically, the cost of the components used in our products tends to drop rapidly as volumes increase and the technologies mature. Therefore, if our third-party manufacturers are unable to promptly use components purchased on our behalf, our cost of producing products may be higher than our competitors due to an oversupply of higher-priced components. Moreover, if they are unable to use components ordered at our direction, we will need to reimburse them for any losses they incur, which could be material. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components, or if we experience any interruption in the supply of components, our product shipments could be reduced or delayed or our cost of obtaining these components may increase. Component shortages and delays affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries, damage our brand and reputation in the market, and cause us to lose sales and market share. For example, component shortages and disruptions in supply related to the COVID-19 induced lockdowns in Shenzhen, China and Shanghai, China previously had limited our ability to supply all the worldwide demand for our NETGEAR for Business switch products, and our revenue and profitability was affected. At times we have elected to purchase components on the spot market or to use more expensive transportation methods, such as air freight, to make up for manufacturing delays caused by component shortages, which reduces our margins. 
 
 Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses, which could result in reduced margins or loss of market share and revenue. 
 
 We compete in a rapidly evolving and fiercely competitive market, and we expect competition to continue to be intense, including price competition. Our principal competitors in the consumer market include ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Devolo, D-Link, Eero (owned by Amazon), Linksys (owned by Foxconn), Minim (Motorola licensee), Google WiFi, Samsung, and TP-Link. Our principal competitors in the business market include Allied Telesys, Barracuda, Buffalo, Cisco Systems, Dell, D-Link, Extreme, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Palo Alto Networks, QNAP Systems, SonicWall, Snap AV, Synology, TP-Link, Ubiquiti and WatchGuard. Our principal competitors in the service provider market include Actiontec, Airties, Arcadyan, ARRIS, ASUS, AVM, Compal Broadband, D-Link, Eero (owned by Amazon), Franklin, Google, Hitron, Huawei, Inseego, Nokia, Plume, Sagem, Sercomm, SMC Networks, TechniColor, TP-Link, Ubee, ZTE and Zyxel. Other competitors include numerous local vendors such as Xiaomi in China, AVM in Germany and Buffalo in Japan. In addition, these local vendors may target markets outside of their local regions and may increasingly compete with us in other regions worldwide. Our potential competitors also include other consumer electronics vendors, including Apple, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio, who could integrate networking and streaming capabilities into their line of products, such as televisions, set top boxes and gaming consoles, and our channel customers who may decide to offer self-branded networking products. We also face competition from service providers who may bundle a free networking device with their broadband service offering, which would reduce our sales if we were not the supplier of choice to those service providers. In the service provider space, we also face significant and increased competition from original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and contract manufacturers who sell and attempt to sell their products directly to service providers around the world. 
 
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. These competitors may, among other things, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers, and exert more influence on sales channels than we can. Certain of our significant competitors also serve as key sales and marketing channels for our products, potentially giving these competitors a marketplace advantage based on their knowledge of our business activities and/or their ability to negatively influence our sales opportunities. For example, Amazon provides an important sales channel for our products, but it also competes with us in the mesh WiFi systems product category through its subsidiary Eero. In addition, certain competitors may have different business models, such as integrated 
 45 

Table of Contents 

manufacturing capabilities, that may allow them to achieve cost savings and to compete on the basis of price. Other competitors may have fewer resources but may be more nimble in developing new or disruptive technology or in entering new markets. We anticipate that current and potential competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets. For example, in the past certain network security companies such as Symantec have introduced security routers for the home consumer market to compete with us and we believe that other network security companies may also seek to do the same. Also, due to our recent success in the audio visual over IP market, some of our competitors may seek to enter this market as well. Price competition is intense in our industry in certain geographical regions and product categories. Many of our competitors in the service provider and retail spaces price their products significantly below our product costs in order to gain market share. Certain substantial competitors have business models that are more focused on customer acquisition and access to customer data rather than on financial return from product sales, and these competitors have the ability to provide sustained price competition to many of our products in the market. Average sales prices have declined in the past and may again decline in the future. These competitors may have more advanced technology, more extensive distribution channels, stronger brand names, greater access to shelf space in retail locations, bigger promotional budgets and larger customer bases than we do. In addition, many of these competitors leverage a broader product portfolio and offer lower pricing as part of a more comprehensive end-to-end solution which we may not have. These companies could devote more capital resources to develop, manufacture and market competing products than we could. Our competitors may acquire other companies in the market and leverage combined resources to gain market share. In some instances, our competitors may be acquired by larger companies with additional formidable resources, such as the purchase of ARRIS by CommScope, Eero by Amazon and Linksys by Foxconn. Additionally, in the case of Linksys, Foxconn is one of our main third-party manufacturing partners, which presents an additional risk if Foxconn decides to prioritize its interest in Linksys over its relationship with us. If any of these companies are successful in competing against us, our sales could decline, our margins could be negatively impacted and we could lose market share, any of which could seriously harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 We depend substantially on our sales channels, and our failure to maintain and expand our sales channels would result in lower sales and reduced net revenue. 
 
 To maintain and grow our market share, net revenue and brand, we must maintain and expand our sales channels. Our sales channels consist of traditional retailers, online retailers, DMRs, VARs, and broadband service providers. Some of these entities purchase our products through our wholesale distributor customers. We generally have no minimum purchase commitments or long-term contracts with any of these third parties. 
 
 Traditional retailers have limited shelf space and promotional budgets, and competition is intense for these resources. If the networking sector does not experience sufficient growth, retailers may choose to allocate more shelf space to other consumer product sectors and may choose to reduce their inventory levels. A competitor with more extensive product lines and stronger brand identity may have greater bargaining power with these retailers. Any reduction in available shelf space or inventory levels or increased competition for such shelf space would require us to increase our marketing expenditures simply to maintain current levels of retail shelf space and inventory levels, which would harm our operating margin. In addition, reduction in inventory levels puts pressure on our ability to accurately forecast customer demand. A failure to accurately predict high demand for a product could result in lost sales or higher product costs if we meet demand by paying higher costs for materials, production and delivery. We could also frustrate our customers and lose further shelf space and market share. A failure to predict low demand for a product could result in excess inventory, further reductions in target inventory levels, lower cash flows and lower margins if we are required to reduce product prices in order to reduce inventories. 
 
 Our traditional retail customers have faced increased and significant competition from online retailers. Further, we have experienced the shift to a greater percentage of purchases taking place online versus traditional retail customers. If we cannot effectively manage our business and inventory requirements amongst our online customers and traditional retail customers, our business would be harmed. The recent trend in the consolidation of online retailers and DMR channels has resulted in intensified competition for preferred product placement, such as product placement on an online retailer s Internet home page. Expanding our presence in the VAR channel may be difficult and expensive. We compete with established companies that have longer operating histories and longstanding relationships with VARs that we would find highly desirable as sales channel partners. In addition, our efforts to realign or consolidate our sales channels may cause temporary disruptions in our product sales and revenue, and these changes may not result in the expected longer-term benefits. We also sell products and services directly to consumers from our own e-commerce platforms. This requires material investment in capital, time and resources and carries the risk that it may not achieve the expected return on investment that we are expecting, and that it may adversely affect our relationships with our existing channel partners, which ultimately may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 We also sell products to broadband service providers. Competition for selling to broadband service providers is fierce and intense. Penetrating service provider accounts typically involves a long sales cycle and the challenge of displacing incumbent 
 46 

Table of Contents 

suppliers with established relationships and field-deployed products. If we are unable to maintain and expand our sales channels, our growth would be limited and our business would be harmed. 
 
 We must also continuously monitor and evaluate emerging sales channels. If we fail to establish a presence in an important developing sales channel, such as sales directly to consumers from our own e-commerce platforms, our business could be harmed. 
 
 We depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing needs. If these third-party manufacturers experience any delay, disruption or quality control problems in their operations, we could lose revenue and our brand may suffer. 
 
 All of our products are manufactured, assembled, tested and generally packaged by a limited number of third-party manufacturers, including original design manufacturers, or ODMs, as well as their sub-contract manufacturers. In most cases, we rely on these manufacturers to procure components and, in some cases, subcontract engineering work. Some of our products are manufactured by a single manufacturer. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of our third-party manufacturers. Some of these third-party manufacturers produce products for our competitors or are themselves competitors in certain product categories. Due to uncertain and changing economic and geopolitical conditions, the viability of some of these third-party manufacturers may be at risk. The loss of the services of any of our primary third-party manufacturers could cause a significant disruption in operations and delays in product shipments. Qualifying a new manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming. Ensuring that a manufacturer is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards is time consuming. In addition, there is no assurance that a manufacturer can produce our products at the appropriate volumes and in the quality that we require. In addition, as we recently have transitioned a substantial portion of our manufacturing facilities to different regions, we are subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality, processes and costs, among other issues, are consistent with our expectations. For example, while we expect our manufacturers to be responsible for penalties assessed on us because of excessive failures of the products, there is no assurance that we will be able to collect such reimbursements from these manufacturers, which causes us to take on additional risk for potential failures of our products. 
 
 Our reliance on third-party manufacturers also exposes us to the following risks over which we have limited control: 
 unexpected increases in manufacturing and repair costs; 

inability to control the quality and reliability of finished products; 

inability to control delivery schedules; 

potential liability for expenses incurred by third-party manufacturers in reliance on our forecasts that later prove to be inaccurate, including the cost of components purchased by third-party manufacturers on our behalf, which may be material; 

potential lack of adequate capacity to manufacture all or a part of the products we require; and 

potential labor unrest affecting the ability of the third-party manufacturers to produce our products. 

All of our products must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some of our products must also receive government certifications. Our third-party manufacturers are primarily responsible for conducting the tests that support our applications for most regulatory approvals for our products. If our third-party manufacturers fail to timely and accurately conduct these tests, we would be unable to obtain the necessary domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. As a result, we would be unable to sell our products and our sales and profitability could be reduced, our relationships with our sales channel could be harmed, and our reputation and brand would suffer. 
 
 Specifically, substantially all of our manufacturing and assembly occurs in the Asia Pacific region, and any disruptions due to natural disasters, climate change, health epidemics and political, social and economic instability in the region would affect the ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products. For example, in late August 2021, heavy rains caused our manufacturer in Thailand to become flooded and created a one-month delay in manufacturing and required us to move some non-U.S. manufacturing back to China. Furthermore, if the cost of production charged by our third-party manufacturers increases, it may affect our margins and ability to lower prices for our products to stay competitive. Labor unrest in Southeast Asia, China or other locations where components and our products are manufactured may also affect our third-party manufacturers as workers may strike and cause production delays. If our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain good relations with their employees or contractors, and production and manufacturing of our products is affected, then we may be subject to shortages of products and quality of products delivered may be affected. Further, if our manufacturers or warehousing 
 47 

Table of Contents 

facilities are disrupted or destroyed, we would have no other readily available alternatives for manufacturing and assembling our products and our business would be significantly harmed. 
 
 In our typical ODM arrangement, our ODMs are generally responsible for sourcing the components of the products and warranting that the products will work against a product s specification, including any software specifications. If we needed to move to a contract manufacturing arrangement, we would take on much more, if not all, of the responsibility around these areas, including increased costs and personnel expertise. If we are unable to properly manage these risks, our products may be more susceptible to defects and our business would be harmed. 
 
 Our sales and operations in international markets have exposed us to and may in the future expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks. 
 
 International sales comprise a significant amount of our overall net revenue. International sales were approximately 32 of overall net revenue in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and approximately 34 of overall net revenue in fiscal 2023. We continue to be committed to growing our international sales, and while we have committed resources to expanding our international operations and sales channels, these efforts may not be successful. For example, in fiscal 2022 we experienced the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which had a meaningful negative impact on our international revenue and our profitability. 
 
 International operations are subject to a number of other risks, including: 
 exchange rate fluctuations and inflation; 

geopolitical and economic tensions, such as in the Middle East, between China/Taiwan, and international terrorism and anti-American sentiment, particularly in emerging markets; 

potential for violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and fraud; 

preference for locally branded products, and laws and business practices favoring local competition; 

changes in local tax and customs duty laws or changes in the enforcement, application or interpretation of such laws (including potential responses to the higher U.S. tariffs on certain imported products implemented by the U.S.); 

increased difficulty in managing inventory and reduced inventory level targets; 

delayed revenue recognition; 

unpredictable judicial systems, which may unfairly favor domestic plaintiffs over foreign corporations, or which may more easily impose harsher penalties such as import injunctions; 

less effective protection of intellectual property; 

stringent consumer protection and product compliance regulations, including but not limited to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive and the European Ecodesign directive, or EuP, that are costly to comply with and may vary from country to country; 

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; and 

business difficulties, including potential bankruptcy or liquidation, of any of our worldwide third-party logistics providers. 

While we believe we generally have good relations with our employees, employees in certain jurisdictions have rights which give them certain collective rights. If management must expend significant resources and effort to address and comply with these rights, our business may be harmed. We are also required to comply with local environmental legislation and our customers rely on this compliance in order to sell our products. If our customers do not agree with our interpretations and requirements of new legislation, they may cease to order our products and our revenue would be harmed. 
 
 We depend on large, recurring purchases from certain significant customers, and a loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively affect our revenue. 
 
 The loss of recurring orders from any of our more significant customers could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors, including the cost-effectiveness, reliability, scalability, 
 48 

Table of Contents 

breadth and depth of our products. In addition, a change in the mix of our customers, or a change in the mix of direct and indirect sales, could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins. 
 
 Although our financial performance may depend on large, recurring orders from certain customers and resellers, we do not generally have binding commitments from them. For example: 
 our reseller agreements generally do not require substantial minimum purchases; 

our customers can stop purchasing and our resellers can stop marketing our products at any time; and 

our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive. 

Further, our revenue may be impacted by significant one-time purchases which are not contemplated to be repeatable. While such purchases are reflected in our financial statements, we do not rely on and do not forecast for continued significant one-time purchases. As a result, lack of repeatable one-time purchases will adversely affect our revenue. 
 
 Because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts, a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to, or unexpected returns from, customers and resellers, or the loss of any significant customer or reseller, could harm or otherwise have a negative impact to our operating results. Although our largest customers may vary from period to period, we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from a small number of customers. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our customers. 
 
 The average selling prices of our products typically decrease rapidly over the sales cycle of the product, which may negatively affect our net revenue and gross margins. 
 
 Our products typically experience price erosion, a fairly rapid reduction in the average unit selling prices over their respective sales cycles. In order to sell products that have a falling average unit selling price and maintain margins at the same time, we need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs. To manage manufacturing costs, we must collaborate with our third-party manufacturers to engineer the most cost-effective design for our products. In addition, we must carefully manage the price paid for components used in our products. We must also successfully manage our freight and inventory costs to reduce overall product costs. We also need to continually introduce new products with higher sales prices and gross margins in order to maintain our overall gross margins. If we are unable to manage the cost of older products or successfully introduce new products with higher gross margins, our net revenue and overall gross margin would likely decline. 
 
 If we fail to overcome the challenges associated with managing our broadband service provider sales channel, our net revenue and gross profit will be negatively impacted. 
 
 We sell a significant number of products through broadband service providers worldwide. However, the service provider sales channel is challenging and exceptionally competitive. Difficulties and challenges in selling to service providers include a longer sales cycle, more stringent product testing and validation requirements, a higher level of customization demands, requirements that suppliers take on a larger share of the risk with respect to contractual business terms, competition from established suppliers, pricing pressure resulting in lower gross margins, and irregular and unpredictable ordering habits. For example, rigorous service provider certification processes may delay our sale of new products, or our products ultimately may fail these tests. In either event, we may lose some or all of the amounts we expended in trying to obtain business from the service provider, as well as lose the business opportunity altogether. In addition, even if we have a product which a service provider customer may wish to purchase, we may choose not to supply products to the potential service provider customer if the contract requirements, such as service level requirements, penalties, and liability provisions, are too onerous. Accordingly, our business may be harmed and our revenues may be reduced. We have, in exceptional limited circumstances, while still in contract negotiations, shipped products in advance of and subject to agreement on a definitive contract. We do not record revenue from these shipments until a definitive contract exists. There is risk that we do not ultimately close and sign a definitive contract. If this occurs, the timing of revenue recognition is uncertain and our business would be harmed. In addition, we often commence building custom-made products prior to execution of a contract in order to meet the customer s contemplated launch dates and requirements. Service provider products are generally custom-made for a specific customer and may not be scalable to other customers or in other channels. If we have pre-built custom-made products but do not come to agreement on a definitive contract, we may be forced to scrap the custom-made products or re-work them at substantial cost and our business would be harmed. 
 
 Further, successful engagements with service provider customers requires a constant analysis of technology trends. If we are unable to anticipate technology trends and service provider customer product needs, and to allocate research and development 
 49 

Table of Contents 

resources to the right projects, we may not be successful in continuing to sell products to service provider customers. In addition, because our service provider customers command significant resources, including for software support, and demand extremely competitive pricing, certain ODMs have declined to develop service provider products on an ODM basis. Accordingly, as our ODMs increasingly limit development of our service provider products, our service provider business will be harmed if we cannot replace this capability with alternative ODMs or in-house development. 
 
 Orders from service providers generally tend to be large but sporadic, which causes our revenues from them to fluctuate and challenges our ability to accurately forecast demand from them. In particular, managing inventory, inventory levels and production of our products for our service provider customers is a challenge and may be further exacerbated by current macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical instability. Many of our service provider customers have irregular purchasing requirements. These customers may decide to cancel orders for customized products specific to that customer, and we may not be able to reconfigure and sell those products in other channels. These cancellations could lead to substantial write-offs. In addition, these customers may issue unforecasted orders for products which we may not be able to produce in a timely manner and as such, we may not be able to accept and deliver on such unforecasted orders. In certain cases, we may commit to fixed-price, long term purchase orders, with such orders priced in foreign currencies which could lose value over time in the event of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. Even if we are selected as a supplier, typically a service provider will also designate a second source supplier, which over time will reduce the aggregate orders that we receive from that service provider. Further, as the technology underlying our products deployed by broadband service providers matures and more competitors offer alternative products with similar technology, we anticipate competing in an extremely price sensitive market and our margins may be affected. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently advanced technology to attract service provider interest in a timely manner, our service provider customers may then require us to lower our prices, or they may choose to purchase products from our competitors. If this occurs, our business would be harmed and our revenues would be reduced. 
 
 If we were to lose a service provider customer for any reason, we may experience a material and immediate reduction in forecasted revenue that may cause us to be below our net revenue and operating margin expectations for a particular period of time and therefore adversely affect our stock price. For example, many of our competitors in the service provider space aggressively price their products in order to gain market share. We may not be able to match the lower prices offered by our competitors, and we may choose to forgo lower-margin business opportunities. Many of the service provider customers will seek to purchase from the lowest cost provider, notwithstanding that our products may be higher quality or that our products were previously validated for use on their proprietary network. Accordingly, we may lose customers who have lower, more aggressive pricing, and our revenues may be reduced. In addition, service providers may choose to prioritize the implementation of other technologies or the roll out of other services than home networking. Weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We have seen slowdowns in capital expenditures by certain of our service provider customers in the past and believe there may be potential for similar slowdowns in the future. Any slowdown in the general economy, over supply, consolidation among service providers, regulatory developments and constraint on capital expenditures could result in reduced demand from service providers and therefore adversely affect our sales to them. If we do not successfully overcome these challenges, we will not be able to profitably manage our service provider sales channel and our financial results will be harmed. 
 
 We expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. 
 
 Our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. If our actual results were to fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts or investors, our quarterly and annual results would be negatively impacted and the price of our stock could decline. Other factors that could affect our quarterly and annual operating results include those listed in the risk factors section of this report and others such as: 
 operational disruptions, such as transportation delays or failure of our order processing system, particularly if they occur at the end of a fiscal quarter; 

component supply constraints, including specialized WiFi 6 or WiFi 7 chipsets, or sudden, unforeseen price increases from our manufacturers, suppliers and vendors; 

unanticipated increases in costs, including air and ocean freight, associated with shipping and delivery of our products; 

the inability to maintain stable operations by our suppliers, distribution centers and other parties with which we have commercial relationships;

unfavorable or compressed level of inventory and turns; 

changes in or consolidation of our sales channels and wholesale distributor relationships or failure to manage our sales channel inventory and warehousing requirements; 

unanticipated decreases, reduced inventory targets or delays in purchases of our products by our significant traditional and online retail customers; 

shift in overall product mix sales from higher to lower gross margin products, from lower-priced products to premium products, or from one business segment to another, that would adversely impact our revenue and gross margins; 

an increase in price protection claims, redemptions of marketing rebates, product warranty and stock rotation returns or allowance for doubtful accounts; 

delay or failure to fulfill orders for our products on a timely basis; 

changes in the pricing policies of or the introduction of new products by us or our competitors; 

unexpected challenges or delays in our ability to further develop services and applications that complement our products and result in meaningful subscriber growth and future recurring revenue;

introductions of new technologies and changes in consumer preferences that result in either unanticipated or unexpectedly rapid product category shifts; 

slow or negative growth in the networking product, personal computer, Internet infrastructure, smart home, home electronics and related technology markets; 

delays in the introduction of new products by us or market acceptance of these products; 

delays in regulatory approvals or consumer adoption of WiFi 6E or WiFi 7 technology in various regions; 

increases in expenses related to the development, introduction and marketing of new products that adversely impact our margins; 

increases in expenses related to the development and marketing related to the Company s direct online sales channels that adversely impact our margins; 

changes in tax rates or adverse changes in tax laws that expose us to additional income tax liabilities; 

changes in U.S. and international trade policy that adversely affect customs, tax or duty rates; 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the jurisdictions where we transact sales and expenditures in local currency; 

unanticipated increases in expenses related to periodic restructuring measures undertaken to achieve profitability and other business goals, including the reallocation or relocation of resources; 

delay or failure of our service provider customers to purchase at their historic volumes or at the volumes that they or we forecast; 

litigation involving alleged patent infringement, consumer class actions, securities class actions or other claims that could negatively impact our reputation, brand, business and financial condition; 

disruptions or delays related to our financial and enterprise resource planning systems;

epidemic or widespread product failure, performance problems or unanticipated safety issues in one or more of our products that could negatively impact our reputation, brand and business; 

any changes in accounting rules; 

challenges associated with integrating acquisitions that we make, or with realizing value from our strategic investments in other companies; 

failure to effectively manage our third-party customer support partners, which may result in customer complaints and/or harm to our brand; 

our inability to monitor and ensure compliance with our code of ethics, our anti-corruption compliance program and domestic and international anti-corruption laws and regulations, whether in relation to our employees or with our suppliers or customers; 

labor unrest at facilities managed by our third-party manufacturers; 

workplace or human rights violations in certain countries in which our third-party manufacturers or suppliers operate, which may require quarantine of affected products, affect our brand and negatively affect our products acceptance by consumers; 

overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole; 

unanticipated shifts or declines in profit by geographical region that would adversely impact our tax rate; and 

our failure to implement and maintain the appropriate internal controls over financial reporting which may result in restatements of our financial statements. 

As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance. 
 
 Changes in trade policy in the United States and other countries, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 International trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing and transportation costs, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Increasing protectionism, economic nationalism, and national security concerns may also lead to further changes in trade policy. For example, when the U.S. government engaged in extended trade negotiations with China, which resulted in the implementation of tariffs on a significant number of products manufactured in China and imported into the United States, we worked closely with our manufacturing partners to implement ways to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our supply chain as promptly and reasonably as practicable, including shifting production outside of China. We cannot predict what further actions may be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. In addition, actions to mitigate the effect of these tariffs are disruptive on our operations, may not be completely successful and may result in higher long-term manufacturing costs. Moreover, there is no certainty that countries to which we have shifted our manufacturing operations will not be subject to similar tariffs in the future. As a result, we may be required to raise our prices on certain products, which could result in the loss of customers and harm to our revenue, market share, competitive position and operating performance. 
 
 Additionally, the imposition of tariffs is dependent upon the classification of items under the Harmonized Tariff System HTS and the country of origin of the item. Determination of the HTS and the origin of the item is a technical matter that can be subjective in nature. Accordingly, although we believe our classifications of both HTS and origin are appropriate, there 
 52 

Table of Contents 

is no certainty that the U.S. government will agree with us. If the U.S. government does not agree with our determinations, we could be required to pay additional amounts, including potential penalties, and our profitability would be adversely impacted. 
 
 If disruptions in our transportation network continue to occur or our shipping costs substantially increase again in the future, we may be unable to sell or timely deliver our products, and our net revenue and gross margin could decrease. 
 
 The transportation network is subject to disruption or congestion from a variety of causes, including labor disputes or port strikes, acts of war, terrorism or other geopolitical conflicts, like the Middle East conflict, natural disasters, effects of climate change, pandemics like COVID-19 and congestion resulting from higher shipping volumes. We are highly dependent upon the transportation systems we use to ship our products, including surface and air freight. Our attempts to closely match our inventory levels to our product demand intensify the need for our transportation systems to function effectively and without delay. On a quarterly basis, our shipping volume also tends to steadily increase as the quarter progresses, which means that any disruption in our transportation network in the latter half of a quarter will likely have a more material effect on our business than at the beginning of a quarter. For example, at times during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced significant limitations on the availability of key transportation resources and significant increases to the cost of air and ocean freight. When these occur, it has negatively impacted our profitability as we seek to transport an increased number of products from manufacturing locations in Asia to other markets around the world as quickly as possible. Moreover, feeder vessels that move containers to key trans-Pacific terminal locations can be subject to similar impacts due to the timing of container transfers and vessel departure dates. In addition, the global effects of climate change can result in increased frequency and severity of natural disasters that could also disrupt our transportation network. For example, in late November 2020, a giant wave damaged a cargo vessel carrying eight containers of our products, causing a 4-month delay to our shipment which ultimately arrived in Southern California in late March 2021. Furthermore, labor disputes among freight carriers and at ports of entry are common. A port worker strike, work slow-down or other transportation disruption in the ports of Singapore, Rotterdam, Los Angeles or Long Beach, California, where we have significant distribution centers, or East coast or Gulf coast of United States due to the volume of imports coming to the U.S. via ports there, could significantly disrupt our business. For example, at times, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had experienced disruptions at the ports, due to multiple factors, such as supply and demand imbalance, a shortage of warehouse workers, truck drivers, and transport equipment (tractors and trailers), and other causes, and had suffered from heightened congestion, bottleneck and gridlock, leading to abnormally high transportation delays. In addition, as mentioned above in the risk factor " Accurately managing our sales channel inventory and product mix within the current environment is challenging, and we have, and may in the future, incur costs associated with excess inventory, or lose sales from having too few products, " many of our retail and service provider customers have and continue to reduce their target inventory levels to more closely match with product demand. This further intensifies the need for our transportation systems to function effectively and without delay. Significant disruptions to the transportation network could lead to significant disruptions in our business, delays in shipments, increased shipping costs, and revenue and profitability shortfalls which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, especially if they were to take place within the last few weeks of any quarter. 
 
 Our international freight is regularly subjected to inspection by governmental entities. If our delivery times increase unexpectedly for these or any other reasons, our ability to deliver products on time would be materially adversely affected and would result in delayed or lost revenue as well as customer-imposed penalties. Similarly, transportation network disruptions such as those described in the preceding paragraph, may also lead to an increase in transportation costs. For example, the cost of shipping our products by ocean freight had previously increased to at least eight times historical levels and had a corresponding impact upon our profitability. Moreover, the cost of shipping our products by air freight is greater than other methods. From time to time in the past, we have shipped products using extensive air freight to meet unexpected spikes in demand, shifts in demand between product categories, to bring new product introductions to market quickly and to timely ship products previously ordered. If we rely more heavily upon air freight to deliver our products, our overall shipping costs will increase. Just as ocean freight costs had previously increased due to the aforementioned supply chain and transportation disruptions, the cost of air freight had previously increased, as well, up to five times historical levels. While transportation costs have recently decreased, if the cost of ocean and air freight were to significantly increase again, it would severely disrupt our business and harm our operating results, and in particular, our profitability. 
 
 Expansion of our operations and infrastructure may strain our operations and increase our operating expenses. 
 
 We have expanded our operations and are pursuing market opportunities both domestically and internationally in order to grow our sales. This expansion has required enhancements to our existing management information systems, and operational and financial controls. In addition, if we continue to grow, our expenditures would likely be significantly higher than our historical costs. We may not be able to install adequate controls in an efficient and timely manner as our business grows, and our current systems may not be adequate to support our future operations. The difficulties associated with installing and implementing new systems, procedures and controls may place a significant burden on our management, operational and financial resources. In addition, if we grow internationally, we will have to expand and enhance our communications infrastructure. If we fail to continue to improve our management information systems, procedures and financial controls or encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion and reorganization, our business could be harmed. 
 53

For example, we have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and enhancement of our financial and enterprise resource planning systems, which may be disruptive to our underlying business. We depend on these systems in order to timely and accurately process and report key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If the systems fail to operate appropriately or we experience any disruptions or delays in enhancing their functionality to meet current business requirements, our ability to fulfill customer orders, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately report our financials and otherwise run our business could be adversely affected. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, the enhancement of systems may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to continue to enhance our information technology systems as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. 
 
 As part of growing our business, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business and operating results could be harmed and our stock price could decline. 
 
 From time to time, we will undertake acquisitions to add new product lines and technologies, gain new sales channels or enter into new sales territories. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following: 
 integrating the companies, assets, systems, products, sales channels and personnel that we acquire; 

higher than anticipated acquisition and integration costs and expenses; 

reliance on third parties to provide transition services for a period of time after closing to ensure an orderly transition of the business; 

growing or maintaining revenues to justify the purchase price and the increased expenses associated with acquisitions; 

entering into territories or markets with which we have limited or no prior experience; 

establishing or maintaining business relationships with customers, vendors and suppliers who may be new to us; 

overcoming the employee, customer, vendor and supplier turnover that may occur as a result of the acquisition; 

disruption of, and demands on, our ongoing business as a result of integration activities including diversion of management s time and attention from running the day-to-day operations of our business; 

inability to implement uniform standards, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over financial reporting and other procedures and policies in a timely manner; 

inability to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire; and 

potential post-closing disputes. 

As part of undertaking an acquisition, we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget, such as issuing common stock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders, assuming liabilities or debt, utilizing a substantial portion of our cash resources to pay for the acquisition or significantly increasing operating expenses. Our acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in charges being taken in an individual quarter as well as future periods, which results in variability in our quarterly earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate in any particular quarter may also be impacted by acquisitions. Following the closing of an acquisition, we may also have disputes with the seller regarding contractual requirements and covenants. Any such disputes may be time consuming and distract management from other aspects of our business. In addition, if we increase the pace or size of acquisitions, we will have to expend significant management time and effort into the transactions and the integrations and we may not have the proper human resources bandwidth to ensure successful integrations and accordingly, our business could be harmed. 
 
 As part of the terms of acquisition, we may commit to pay additional contingent consideration if certain revenue or other performance milestones are met. We are required to evaluate the fair value of such commitments at each reporting date and adjust the amount recorded if there are changes to the fair value. 
 
 We cannot ensure that we will be successful in selecting, executing and integrating acquisitions. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. In addition, if stock market analysts or our stockholders do not support or believe in the value of the acquisitions that we choose to undertake, our stock price may decline.

We invest in companies primarily for strategic reasons but may not realize a return on our investments. 
 
 We have made, and continue to seek to make, investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. These investments may include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and may be non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. We do not restrict the types of companies in which we seek to invest. These companies may range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. If any company in which we invest fails, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested, we will have to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. The performance of any of these investments could result in significant impairment charges and gains (losses) on investments. We must also analyze accounting and legal issues when making these investments. If we do not structure these investments properly, we may be subject to certain adverse accounting issues, such as potential consolidation of financial results. 
 
 Furthermore, if the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may seek to dispose of the investment. Our non-marketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid, and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our results. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities and impairment charges related to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Products, Technology and Intellectual Property 
 
 We rely upon third parties for technology that is critical to our products, and if we are unable to continue to use this technology and future technology, our ability to develop, sell, maintain and support technologically innovative products would be limited. 
 
 We rely on third parties to obtain non-exclusive patented hardware and software license rights in technologies that are incorporated into and necessary for the operation and functionality of most of our products. In these cases, because the intellectual property we license is available from third parties, barriers to entry into certain markets may be lower for potential or existing competitors than if we owned exclusive rights to the technology that we license and use. Moreover, if a competitor or potential competitor enters into an exclusive arrangement with any of our key third-party technology providers, or if any of these providers unilaterally decide not to do business with us for any reason, our ability to develop and sell products containing that technology would be severely limited. If we are shipping products that contain third-party technology that we subsequently lose the right to license, then we will not be able to continue to offer or support those products. In addition, these licenses often require royalty payments or other consideration to the third-party licensor. Our success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to access these technologies, and we do not know whether these third-party technologies will continue to be licensed to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to license the necessary technology, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards, which would limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and increase our costs of production. As a result, our revenue, margins, market share, and operating results could be significantly harmed. 
 
 We also utilize third-party software development companies to develop, customize, maintain and support software that is incorporated into our products. For example, we license software from Bitdefender for our NETGEAR Armor cybersecurity services offering and we license software from Circle Media Labs, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Aura, for our parental controls service offering. If these companies fail to timely deliver or continuously maintain and support the software, as we require of them, we may experience delays in releasing new products or difficulties with supporting existing products and customers. In addition, if these third-party licensors fail or experience instability, then we may be unable to continue to sell products that incorporate the licensed technologies in addition to being unable to continue to maintain and support these products. We do require escrow arrangements with respect to certain third-party software which entitle us to certain limited rights to the source code, in the event of certain failures by the third party, in order to maintain and support such software. However, there is no guarantee that we would be able to fully understand and use the source code, as we may not have the expertise to do so. We are increasingly exposed to these risks as we continue to develop and market more products and services containing third-party software, such as our subscription service offerings related to network security and smart parental controls. If we are unable to license the necessary technology, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which could be of lower quality or performance standards. The acquisition or development of alternative technology may limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and services and increase our costs of production. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Product security vulnerabilities, system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and improper use of artificial intelligence AI tools, could disrupt our products, services, internal operations or information technology systems, and any such disruption could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely affect our stock price. 
 
 Our products and services could be compromised due to security vulnerabilities. For example, the firmware, software and open source software that we or our manufacturing partners have installed on our products may be susceptible to hacking or misuse. We devote considerable time and resources to uncovering and remedying these vulnerabilities, using both internal and external resources, but the threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated and we continue to implement additional protections and increase our monitoring and threat intelligence. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our systems and products are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as viruses and worms, vulnerabilities such as command injection, cross site scripting, credential stuffing attacks, authentication and session management, and stack-based buffer overflow, and other sophisticated attacks or exploits. It is also possible that an attacker could compromise our internal code repository or those of our partners and insert a backdoor that would give them easy access to any of our devices using this code. This particular kind of attack is very sophisticated, relatively new, and hard to defend against. We may not be able to discover these vulnerabilities, and we may not be able to remedy these vulnerabilities in a timely manner, or at all, which may impact our brand and reputation and harm our business. These attacks could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, unauthorized access to user data, and loss of consumer confidence. If successful, these attacks could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative publicity, adversely affect our brand, decrease demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us, or we may voluntarily choose to, notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, investors and others of security breaches. Such disclosures and related actions can be costly and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such applicable requirements could lead to adverse consequences. Further, under certain circumstances, we may need to prioritize fixing vulnerabilities or responding to security breaches over new product development, which may impact our revenues and adversely affect our business. 
 
 In addition, we offer a comprehensive online cloud management service paired with a number of our products. If malicious actors compromise this cloud service, or if customer confidential information is accessed without authorization, our business and reputation would be harmed. We rely on third-party providers for a number of critical aspects of our cloud services, e-commerce site and customer support, including web hosting services, billing and payment processing, and consequently we do not maintain direct control over the security or stability of the associated systems. 
 
 Maintaining the security of our computer information systems and communication systems is a critical issue for us and our customers. Malicious actors may develop and deploy malware that is designed to manipulate our products and systems, including our internal network, or those of our vendors or customers. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information technology systems, our data or our customers data. We have established a crisis management plan, business continuity program, information security incident response plan and Generative AI policy. While we regularly test and update these plans, policy and program, there can be no assurance that the plans, policy and program can withstand an actual or serious disruption in our business, including a data protection breach or cyber-attack. While we have established infrastructure and geographic redundancy for our critical systems, our ability to utilize these redundant systems requires further testing and we cannot be assured that such systems are fully functional. For example, much of our order fulfillment process is automated and the order information is stored on our servers. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages and harm our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our major offices worldwide are operating under hybrid work model, allowing employees the flexibility to work from home and at the workplace. Work from home arrangements present additional cybersecurity risks, including potential increases in malware and phishing attacks, greater challenges to secure home office data, and potential service degradation or disruption to key internal business applications and third-party services. Although we have taken measures to address these risks, they present challenges that could impact business operations and could cause recovery times to increase. If our computer systems and servers become unavailable at the end of a fiscal quarter, our ability to recognize revenue may be delayed until we are able to utilize back-up systems and continue to process and ship our orders, this could cause our stock price to decline significantly. 
 
 We devote considerable internal and external resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and customer data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. In addition, U.S. and foreign regulators have increased their focus on cybersecurity (including related vulnerabilities and risks) and many states, countries and jurisdictions have laws and regulations that may impose significant penalties for failure to comply with these 
 56 

Table of Contents 

requirements. Compliance with laws and regulations concerning artificial intelligence, privacy, cybersecurity, data governance and data protection is a rigorous and time-intensive process, that continuously evolves and develops, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations and incur substantial expenditures. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws and regulations are not consistent. The applicability and scope of these laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, regulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach or other cybersecurity incident could be costly. 
 
 Actual and potential breaches of our security measures as well as the loss, disclosure or dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our employees or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of improper use of AI tools, employee error or other employee actions, hacking, fraud, social engineering or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, subject us to significant governmental fines, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. It may be difficult and/or costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain and remediate security breaches and our efforts to do so may not be successful. Actions taken by us or third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain and remediate a security breach could result in outages, data losses, disruptions to our business and otherwise harm our business. Unauthorized parties may also gain access to other networks, systems and products after a compromise of our networks, systems, and products. 
 
 Our management has spent increasing amounts of time, effort and expense in this area, and in the event of the discovery of significant product or system security vulnerability, or improper use of AI tools or other cybersecurity incidents, we could incur additional substantial expenses and our business and reputation could be harmed. If we or our third-party providers are unable to successfully prevent breaches of security relating to our products, services, systems or customer private information, including customer personal identification information, or if these third-party systems failed for other reasons, it could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. 
 
 If we are unable to successfully leverage AI technology to automate and drive efficiencies in our operations and products and services, our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
 
 We have embarked on an AI transformation effort to take full advantage of automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other technologies to drive efficiencies and improve productivity within our Company and to develop and improve our products, services and customer experiences. As we increase our investment in technology, software and systems to support this transformation effort, such investments may not increase productivity, result in more efficient operations or deliver better products, services and customer experiences. In addition, the evolution of these technologies may create unforeseen competitive pressures or cause disruption or delays to our operations, which may harm our business. Our competitors may incorporate AI technologies into their products and services more quickly or more successfully than us and could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed, and the use of AI has been known to result in, and may in the future result in cybersecurity incidents. Further, the rapid evolution of AI may require the dedication of significant resources to develop, test and maintain AI technologies. If our incorporation of AI technologies does not increase our operational efficiency in accordance with our expectations, or if competition increases for the technology and services provided by third parties, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed. While we have established an AI transformation leadership team to coordinate and oversee our approach to AI adoption, the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding generative AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain including in the areas of intellectual property, discrimination, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. Compliance with existing, new, and changing laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to AI may limit some uses of AI, impose significant operational costs, and limit our ability to develop, deploy, or use AI technologies. Further, the continued integration of any AI technologies into our products and services may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm. 
 
 We make substantial investments in software research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We continue to evolve our historically hardware-centric business model towards a model that includes more sophisticated software offerings, including subscription services and applications that complement our products and are intended to drive subscriber growth and future recurring revenue. As such, we have evolved the focus of our organization towards the delivery of more integrated hardware and software solutions for our customers, as well as related services, and we have and will continue 
 57 

Table of Contents 

to expend additional resources in this area in the future, including key new hires. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations and insufficient revenue to offset expenses associated with this strategy. Software development is inherently risky for a company such as ours with a historically hardware-centric business model, and accordingly, our efforts in software development may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 
 If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our software solutions, services, applications, pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product and services decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our revenue, profitability and prospects. 
 
 Software research and development is complex. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our output from these investments will successfully result in meaningful customer demand and retention for our products and services. We must accurately forecast mixes of software solutions and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product s life cycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new software solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position. In addition, our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues and defects. We may be unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix to address defects. Finding solutions to quality issues or defects can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. If new or existing customers have difficulty with our software solutions or are dissatisfied with our services, our operating margins could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 If our products contain defects or errors, we could incur significant unexpected expenses, experience product returns and lost sales, experience product recalls, suffer damage to our brand and reputation, and be subject to product liability or other claims. 
 
 Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors or failures, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released. The industry standards upon which many of our products are based are also complex, experience change over time and may be interpreted in different manners. Some errors and defects may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used by the end-user. As also noted in the risk factor We make substantial investments in software research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations above, we devote considerable time and resources on testing and quality control efforts to detect quality issues and defects, and any reallocation of resources to fix such quality issues and defects could lead to delays in product introductions, which could further harm our competitive position. Additionally, certain software components in our product and corporate systems can be directly updated by our third-party partners. Defects, errors or failures in such updates could impact our customer's experience or cause business interruptions. 
 
 In addition, epidemic failure clauses are found in certain of our customer contracts, especially contracts with service providers. If invoked, these clauses may entitle the customer to return for replacement or obtain credits for products and inventory, as well as assess liquidated damage penalties and terminate an existing contract and cancel future or then current purchase orders. In such instances, we may also be obligated to cover significant costs incurred by the customer associated with the consequences of such epidemic failure, including freight and transportation required for product replacement and out-of-pocket costs for truck rolls to end user sites to collect the defective products. Costs or payments we make in connection with an epidemic failure may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If our products contain defects or errors, or are found to be noncompliant with industry standards, we could experience decreased sales and increased product returns, loss of customers and market share, and increased service, warranty and insurance costs. In addition, defects in, or misuse of, certain of our products could cause safety concerns, including the risk of property damage or personal injury. If any of these events occurred, our reputation and brand could be damaged, and we could face product liability or other claims regarding our products, resulting in unexpected expenses and adversely impacting our operating results. For instance, if a third party were able to successfully overcome the security measures in our products, such a person or entity could misappropriate customer data, third party data stored by our customers and other information, including intellectual property and personal information. In addition, the operations of our end-user customers may be interrupted. If that happens, affected end-users or others may file actions against us alleging product liability, tort, or breach of warranty claims.

Our user growth, engagement, and monetization of our subscription services on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control. 
 
 The substantial majority of our revenue from our subscription services is generated from use of such services on mobile devices. We are dependent on the interoperability of Armor and our parental controls services and our other products and services with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products or services, give preferential treatment to competitive products, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products could adversely affect the usage of our subscription services products or our other products and services on mobile devices. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products and services that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our subscription services products or our other products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our subscription services products or our other products on their mobile devices, our user growth and user engagement and our business could be harmed. 
 
 If we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be harmed. 
 
 We rely upon third parties for a substantial portion of the intellectual property that we use in our products. At the same time, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and suppliers and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and technology. Despite efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized third parties may attempt to design around, copy aspects of our product design or obtain and use technology or other intellectual property associated with our products. For example, one of our primary intellectual property assets is the NETGEAR name, trademark and logo. We may be unable to stop third parties from adopting similar names, trademarks and logos, particularly in those international markets where our intellectual property rights may be less protected. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or design around our intellectual property. In addition, we manufacture and sell our products in many international jurisdictions that offer reduced levels of protection and recourse from intellectual property misuse or theft, as compared to the United States. Our inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our brand and business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Financial, Legal, Regulatory and Tax Compliance Risks, Including Recent Impairment Charges 
 
 We are currently involved in numerous litigation matters in the ordinary course and may in the future become involved in additional litigation, including litigation regarding intellectual property rights, consumer class actions and securities class actions, any of which could be costly and subject us to significant liability. 
 
 The networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding infringement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the data communications markets, some of which are our competitors, have extensive patent portfolios with respect to networking technology. From time to time, third parties, including these leading companies, have asserted and may continue to assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us demanding license or royalty payments or seeking payment for damages, injunctive relief and other available legal remedies through litigation. These also include third-party non-practicing entities who claim to own patents or other intellectual property that cover industry standards that our products comply with. If we are unable to resolve these matters or obtain licenses on acceptable or commercially reasonable terms, we could be sued or we may be forced to initiate litigation to protect our rights. The cost of any necessary licenses or cost to defend litigation could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may also choose to join defensive patent aggregation services in order to prevent or settle litigation and avoid the associated significant costs and uncertainties of litigation. These patent aggregation services may obtain, or have previously obtained, licenses for the alleged patent infringement claims against us and other patent assets that could be used offensively against us. The costs of such defensive patent aggregation services, while potentially lower than the costs of litigation, may be significant as well. At any time, any of these non-practicing entities, or any other third-party could initiate litigation against us, or we may be forced to initiate litigation against them, which could divert management attention, be costly to defend or prosecute, prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology, require us to design around the challenged technology and cause the price of our stock to decline. In 2022, a third-party initiated litigation against us in Germany and China, which carries with it the threat of an injunction on the importation of our products into Germany and China, as well as a significant increase in time and resources to defend against. In addition, third parties, some of whom are potential competitors, have initiated and may continue to initiate litigation against us, our manufacturers, suppliers, members of our sales channels or our service provider customers 
 59 

Table of Contents 

or even end user customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to existing or future products. In the event successful claims of infringement are brought by third parties, and we are unable to obtain licenses or independently develop alternative technology on a timely basis, we may be subject to indemnification obligations, be unable to offer competitive products, or be subject to increased expenses. Consumer class-action lawsuits related to the marketing and performance of our home networking products have been asserted and may in the future be asserted against us. Finally, we have been sued in securities class action lawsuits, and may in the future be named in other similar lawsuits. For additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved, see the information set forth in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies , in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If we do not resolve these claims on a favorable basis, our business, operating results and financial condition could be significantly harmed. 
 
 We have been exposed to and may in the future be exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could harm our financial results and cash flows. 
 
 Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Although a portion of our international sales are currently invoiced in United States dollars, we have implemented and continue to implement for certain countries and customers both invoicing and payment in foreign currencies. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan and Australia as well as our global operations, and non-U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses and certain assets and liabilities. In addition, weaknesses in foreign currencies for U.S. dollar denominated sales could adversely affect demand for our products. For example, the volatility and strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2022 had a meaningful negative impact on our international revenue and our profitability. Conversely, a strengthening in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase foreign currency denominated costs. As a result, we may attempt to renegotiate pricing of existing contracts or request payment to be made in U.S. dollars. We cannot be sure that our customers would agree to renegotiate along these lines. This could result in customers eventually terminating contracts with us or in our decision to terminate certain contracts, which would adversely affect our sales. 
 
 We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a response to the risk of changes in the value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts or other instruments, the majority of which mature within approximately five months. Our foreign currency forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For example, we do not execute forward contracts in all currencies in which we conduct business. In addition, we hedge to reduce the impact of volatile exchange rates on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit for limited periods of time. However, the use of these hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. 
 
 We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures, including bank failures, in weakened markets, which could result in material losses. 
 
 A substantial portion of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 to 60 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We monitor individual customer financial viability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. 
 
 In the past, there have been bankruptcies amongst our customer base, and certain of our customers businesses face financial challenges that put them at risk of future bankruptcies. Although losses resulting from customer bankruptcies have not been material to date, any future bankruptcies could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, recent banking sector troubles and liquidity concerns in the financial services industry have impacted certain of our suppliers. Although such impacts have not resulted in material losses to date, any future bank sector disruptions could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, our customers ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our future profitability. 
 
 Factors that could materially affect our future effective tax rates include but are not limited to: 
 changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment; 

changes in accounting and tax standards or practices; 

60 

Table of Contents 

changes in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction; and 

our operating results before taxes. 

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws. Foreign jurisdictions have increased the volume of tax audits of multinational corporations. Further, many countries continue to consider changes in their tax laws by implementing new taxes such as the digital service tax and initiatives such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s (OECD) Pillar II global minimum tax. More than 140 countries agreed to enact the Pillar II global minimum tax. While the OECD issued a framework model, each country will enact its own laws to incorporate Pillar II. While Pillar II is a global model, the country by country enactment of different laws to incorporate the framework is complex and there is uncertainty as to how the enactment of these laws will impact the Company. These changes could increase our total tax burden in the future. In addition, the acceleration of employee mobility as a result of the pandemic potentially increases the jurisdictional tax risk of our workforce. Changes in tax laws could affect the distribution of our earnings, result in double taxation and adversely affect our results. 
 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included provisions effective for the 2022 tax year that eliminate the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for domestic payments and 15 years for payments to foreign parties. These provisions have not been deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress as was previously anticipated might occur. In years where we are profitable, these provisions have a material impact on our cash taxes which will continue in the future if these provisions are not modified, or repealed by Congress. 
 
 We have been audited by the Italy Tax Authority ITA for the 2004 through 2012 tax years. The ITA examination included an audit of income, gross receipts and value-added taxes. We have been in litigation with the ITA for the 2004 through 2012 years. This litigation was appealed by the ITA to the Italian Supreme Court. Our hearing on all years at the Italian Supreme Court was held on March 6, 2024. Decisions were issued in the Company s favor for the 2006 through 2012 tax years. Decisions on the 2004 through 2006 tax years were reverted back to the lower court for re-hearing. If we are unsuccessful in defending our tax positions for the remaining years, our profitability will be reduced. 
 
 We are also subject to examination by other tax authorities, including state revenue agencies and other foreign governments. While we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, the IRS and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and services and the use of intangibles. Tax authorities could disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If we do not prevail in any such disagreements, our profitability may be affected. 
 
 Historically the computation of our tax provision assumes that we will have sufficient profitability in the respective jurisdictions to continue to record deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance. As of the period ended October 1, 2023, we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would have sufficient profitability to realize the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we recorded a full valuation allowance to impair U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Future benefit of these deferred tax assets will be realized in the period they are utilized. 
 
 We are subject to, and must remain in compliance with numerous new, existing and changing laws and regulations worldwide concerning the manufacturing, use, distribution and sale of our products. Some of our customers also require that we comply with their own unique requirements relating to these matters. Any failure to comply with such laws, regulations and requirements, and any associated unanticipated costs, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are a global company subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing, and the interpretations, applications or impact of these laws and regulations on us are uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we manufacture and sell products which contain electronic components, and such components may contain materials that are subject to government regulation in both the locations that we manufacture and assemble our products, as well as the locations where we sell our products. Certain regulations also limit the use of lead in electronic components. To our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all applicable 
 61 

Table of Contents 

current government regulations concerning the materials utilized in our products, for all the locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process which requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations. There are areas where new regulations have been enacted which could increase our cost of the components that we utilize or require us to expend additional resources to ensure compliance. For example, the SEC s conflict minerals rules apply to our business, and we expended significant resources to ensure compliance. The implementation of these requirements by government regulators and our partners and/or customers could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components used in our products. In addition, the supply-chain due diligence investigation required by the conflict minerals rules require expenditures of resources and management attention regardless of the results of the investigation. If there is an unanticipated new regulation or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations which significantly impacts our use of various components or requires more expensive components, that regulation would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 One area which has a large number of evolving and developing regulations is environmental compliance. Management of environmental pollution, climate change and other ESG considerations has produced significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and we believe this will continue both in scope and the number of countries participating. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products. Environmental regulations require us to reduce product energy usage, monitor and exclude an expanding list of restricted substances and to participate in required recover and recycling of our products. While future changes in regulations are certain, we are currently unable to predict how any such changes will impact us and if such impacts will be material to our business. If there is a new law or regulation, or a new interpretation and application of existing laws, that significantly increases our costs of manufacturing or causes us to significantly alter the way that we manufacture our products, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our selling and distribution practices are also regulated in large part by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign antitrust and competition laws and regulations. In general, the objective of these laws is to promote and maintain free competition by prohibiting certain forms of conduct that tend to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise control the market for goods or services to the detriment of consumers of those goods and services. Potentially prohibited activities under these laws may include unilateral conduct, or conduct undertaken as the result of an agreement with one or more of our suppliers, competitors, or customers. The potential for liability under these laws can be difficult to predict as it often depends on a finding that the challenged conduct resulted in harm to competition, such as higher prices, restricted supply, or a reduction in the quality or variety of products available to consumers. We utilize a number of different distribution channels to deliver our products to the end consumer, and regularly enter agreements with resellers of our products at various levels in the distribution chain that could be subject to scrutiny under these laws in the event of private litigation or an investigation by a governmental competition authority. In addition, many of our products are sold to consumers via the Internet. Many of the competition-related laws that govern these Internet sales were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet, and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by online sales. New interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations, whether by courts or by the state, federal or foreign governmental authorities charged with the enforcement of those laws and regulations, may also impact our business in ways we are currently unable to predict. Any failure on our part or on the part of our employees, agents, distributors or other business partners to comply with the laws and regulations governing competition can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant litigation liabilities and other penalties. 
 
 In addition to government regulations, many of our customers require us to comply with their own requirements regarding manufacturing, health and safety matters, corporate social responsibility, employee treatment, anti-corruption, use of materials, environmental concerns and other ESG considerations. Some customers may require us to periodically report on compliance with their unique requirements, and some customers reserve the right to audit our business for compliance. We are increasingly subject to requests for compliance with these customer requirements. For example, there has been significant focus from our customers as well as the press regarding corporate social responsibility policies and other ESG considerations. We regularly audit our manufacturers; however, any deficiencies in compliance by our manufacturers may harm our business and our brand. In addition, we may not have the resources to maintain compliance with these customer requirements and failure to comply may result in decreased sales to these customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We must comply with indirect tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, as well as complex customs duty regimes worldwide. Audits of our compliance with these rules may result in additional liabilities for taxes, duties, interest and penalties related to our international operations which would reduce our profitability. 
 
 62 

Table of Contents 

Our operations are routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in various countries. Many countries have indirect tax systems where the sale and purchase of goods and services are subject to tax based on the transaction value. These taxes are commonly referred to as sales and/or use tax, value-added tax ("VAT") or goods and services tax ("GST"). In addition, the distribution of our products subjects us to numerous complex customs regulations, which frequently change over time. Failure to comply with these systems and regulations can result in the assessment of additional taxes, duties, interest and penalties. While we believe we are in compliance with local laws, we cannot assure that tax and customs authorities would agree with our reporting positions and upon audit may assess us additional taxes, duties, interest and penalties. 
 
 Additionally, some of our products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. We also incorporate encryption technology into certain of our solutions. These encryption solutions and underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations or exceptions, including by license, a license exception, appropriate classification notification requirement and encryption authorization. 
 
 Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the shipment of certain products and services without the required export authorizations, including to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. embargoes or sanctions. Additionally, the current U.S. administration has been critical of existing trade agreements and may impose more stringent export and import controls. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time consuming and may result in delay or loss of sales opportunities even if the export license ultimately is granted. While we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being exported in violation of these laws, including using authorizations or exceptions for our encryption products and implementing IP address blocking and screenings against U.S. government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons and countries, we have not been able to guarantee, and cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws, including if purchasers of our products bring our products and services into sanctioned countries without our knowledge. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in significant fines or penalties and incarceration could be imposed on employees and managers for criminal violations of these laws. 
 
 Also, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and services or our end-users ability to utilize our solutions in their countries. Changes in our products and services or changes in import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets. 
 
 Adverse action by any government agencies related to indirect tax laws could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of our business, we have investments with both domestic and international financial institutions. Accordingly, we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, which may limit our investment income. If these financial institutions default on their obligations or their credit ratings are negatively impacted by liquidity issues, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors, the value of our cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Governmental regulations of imports or exports affecting Internet security could affect our net revenue. 
 
 Any additional governmental regulation of imports or exports or failure to obtain required export approval of our encryption technologies could adversely affect our international and domestic sales. The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, particularly encryption technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys. In response to terrorist activity, governments could enact additional regulation or restriction on the use, import, or export of encryption technology. This additional regulation of encryption technology could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications, resulting in decreased demand for our products and services. In addition, some foreign 
 63 

Table of Contents 

competitors are subject to less stringent controls on exporting their encryption technologies. As a result, they may be able to compete more effectively than we can in the United States and the international Internet security market. 
 
 If our goodwill becomes impaired, as occurred in 2022, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 
 
 Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered when determining if the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization. 
 
 As a result of our acquisitions, we have significant goodwill recorded on our balance sheets. In addition, significant negative industry or economic trends, such as those that have occurred as a result of the recent economic downturn, including reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business could indicate that goodwill might be impaired. If, in any period our stock price decreases to the point where our market capitalization is less than our book value, this too could indicate a potential impairment and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on projections of future operating performance. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. For example, in 2022, the market price of our common stock and market capitalization declined and the U.S. WiFi market contracted, which had a significant negative impact on our Connected Home business. As a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022. We have not recognized any impairment charge on our NETGEAR for Business reporting unit. However, we operate in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. As a result, we may incur substantial impairment charges to earnings in our financial statements should an impairment of our goodwill be determined on our NETGEAR for Business reporting unit, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 If we lose the services of our key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. 
 
 Changes in our management team may disrupt our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance. For example, we appointed a new Chief Executive Officer effective January 31, 2024 and have made other leadership changes and hires. The failure to successfully transition could adversely affect our results of operations. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Our business model requires extremely skilled and experienced senior management who are able to withstand the rigorous requirements and expectations of our business. Our success depends on senior management being able to execute at a very high level. The loss of our senior management or other key engineering, research, development, sales or marketing personnel, particularly if lost to competitors, could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing needs of our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to hire for key functions. The market for talent in the technology industry, especially in the areas of software and subscription services is competitive, and we may not have the resources to compete at the same level as larger companies who are able to offer more compelling compensation packages. Therefore, our ability to recruit new talent and retain existing talent may be adversely affected, and as a result our business as a whole may suffer. While we believe that we have mitigated some of the business execution and business continuity risk with our organization into two business segments with separate leadership teams, the loss of any key personnel would still be disruptive and harm our business, especially given that our business is leanly staffed and relies on the expertise and high performance of our key personnel. 
 
 Global economic conditions could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 
 
 Our business has been and may continue to be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general geopolitical, economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial markets, and changes in the overall demand for Pro AV, networking and smart home products. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers financial condition and the levels of business activity of our customers. Weakness in, and uncertainty about, global economic conditions may cause businesses to postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for networking products. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations 
 64 

Table of Contents 

could adversely impact the demand and sale of our products to end users and the quantity of products our customers decide to purchase from us (or change the mix of products demanded) and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2022, our APAC sales were dampened by a sudden economic downturn in China due to sudden, widespread COVID-19 infections and illnesses. 
 
 The uncertainty in global and regional economic conditions have also affected the financial markets and financial institutions on which we rely and have resulted in a number of adverse effects including a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, banking sector disruptions, extreme volatility in credit, equity, currency and fixed income markets, instability in the stock market, high inflation and high unemployment. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses. If we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic, geopolitical and financial conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes which could further disrupt our business or limit our ability to access certain assets and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, availability of our products from third-party manufacturers and our ability to distribute our products into the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions may be impacted by factors such as an increase in duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade; raw material shortages or price increases, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest; uncertain economic conditions; economic crises and international disputes or conflicts; changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products; and failure of the United States to maintain normal trade relations with China and other countries. Any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Furthermore, uncertainty about, or worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect consumer sentiment and demand for our products and services. Consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected by financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate, mortgage and technology markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor reductions, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. This could also impact the quantity of products our customers decide to purchase from us and may have a longer-term impact on the inventory levels these customers choose to carry. Lower demands could also impact manufacturing capacity utilization and contribute to further increased component costs. These and other economic factors could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 
 
 Political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, climate changes, natural disasters, sudden changes in trade and immigration policies, and other circumstances could materially adversely affect us. 
 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Northern California and one of our warehouses is located in Southern California. Substantially all of our critical enterprise-wide information technology systems, including our main servers, are currently housed in colocation facilities in Arizona and different geographic regions in the United States. The majority of our manufacturing occurs in Southeast Asia and mainland China. Each of these regions are known for or susceptible to seismic activity and other natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding. Furthermore, the global effects of climate change have resulted in increased frequency and severity of these extreme weather events and could cause physical damage or disrupt operations. If our manufacturers or warehousing facilities are disrupted or destroyed, we would be unable to distribute our products on a timely basis, which could harm our business. This could also lead to increased costs and decreased revenues. 
 
 In addition, health epidemics, war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, social and economic instability, public health issues, sudden changes in trade and immigration policies (such as the higher tariffs on certain products imported from China, U.S. sanctions against Russia as a result of the Russia-Ukraine dispute, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and Red Sea crisis), and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, geopolitical disputes or conflicts, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond our control. In addition, in the past, labor disputes at third-party manufacturing facilities have led to workers going on strike, and labor unrest could materially affect our third-party manufacturers abilities to manufacture our products. 
 
 Such events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult, more expensive or impossible for us to make and deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our direct or indirect suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. Wars or geopolitical conflicts, major public health issues, including pandemics such as COVID-19, could negatively affect us through more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight 
 65 

Table of Contents 

services or increase in freight costs, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of our manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. 
 
 Our stock price has experienced recent volatility and may be volatile in the future and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value. 
 
 There has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies in the technology industry and the stock market as a whole, which may be unrelated to the financial performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Some specific factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include: 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors operating results; 

actual or anticipated changes in the growth rate of the general networking sector, our growth rates or our competitors growth rates; 

conditions in the financial markets in general or changes in general economic, political and market conditions, including government efforts to mitigate economic downturns or control inflation; 

novel and unforeseen market forces and trading strategies, such as the massive short squeeze rally caused by retail investors on companies such as GameStop; 

actual or anticipated changes in governmental regulation, including taxation and tariff policies; 

interest rate or currency exchange rate fluctuations; 

our ability to forecast or report accurate financial results; and 

changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally. 

We are required to evaluate our internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation, including restatements of our issued financial statements, could impact investor confidence in the reliability of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report must contain among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. From time to time, we conduct internal investigations as a result of whistleblower complaints. In some instances, the whistleblower complaint may implicate potential areas of weakness in our internal controls. Although all known material weaknesses have been remediated, we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken ensure that restatements will not occur in the future. Execution of restatements create a significant strain on our internal resources and could cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results, increase our costs and cause management distraction. Restatements may also significantly affect our stock price in an adverse manner. 
 
 Continued performance of the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is both costly and challenging. During this process, if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of a fiscal year or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have an adverse effect on our stock price.

If Landlord elects not to rebuild and/or restore the Premises, Tenant shall entitled to retain, and shall not be obligated to assign to Landlord, that portion of the insurance proceeds payable to Tenant under Tenant's insurance required under Sections 10.3.2 above that pertain solely to Tenant's coverage for improvements and/or alterations within the Premises that are paid for solely by Tenant with monies that are other than any tenant improvement allowances provided to Tenant by Landlord (provided, however, for avoidance of doubt, Tenant shall assign to Landlord all other insurance proceeds as set forth hereinabove). In connection with such repairs and replacements of any such tenant improvements and alterations, Tenant shall, prior to Landlord's commencement of such improvement work, submit to Landlord, for Landlord's review and approval, all plans, specifications and working drawings relating thereto, and Landlord shall designate the contractors to perform such improvement work (as such contractors may be approved by Tenant, with any such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or its visitors, or injury to Tenant's business resulting in any way from such damage or the repair thereof; provided however, that if such fire or other casualty shall have damaged the Premises or common areas necessary to Tenant's occupancy, and if such damage is not the result of the willful misconduct of Tenant or Tenant's employees, contractors, licensees, or invitees, Landlord shall allow Tenant a proportionate abatement of Base Rent and Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs, during the time and to the extent the Premises are unfit for occupancy for the purposes permitted under this Lease, and not occupied by Tenant as a result thereof. 
 
 11.2 Termination Rights . Within sixty (60) days after Landlord becomes aware of such damage, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing Landlord's Damage Notice of the estimated time, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, required to substantially complete the work Landlord is required to perform pursuant to Section 11.1 above (the Landlord's Restoration Work ). Notwithstanding Section 11.1 above to the contrary, Landlord may elect not to rebuild and/or restore the Premises, the Building and/or any other portion of the Real Property and instead terminate this Lease by notifying Tenant in writing of such termination within sixty (60) days after the date Landlord becomes aware of such damage, such notice to include a termination date giving Tenant ninety 

(90) days to vacate the Premises, but Landlord may so elect only if the Building shall be damaged by fire or other casualty or cause, and one or more of the following conditions is present: (i) Landlord's Restoration Work cannot, in the reasonable opinion of Landlord as set forth in Landlord's Damage Notice, be substantially completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such damage (when such repairs are made without the payment of overtime or other premiums, unless Tenant agrees, in writing, prior to Landlord's determination, to be responsible for any such increase in costs, and pays such costs upon request); (ii) the holder of any mortgage on the Real Property and/or the Building or ground or underlying lessor with respect to the Real Property and/or the Building shall require that the insurance proceeds or any portion thereof be used to retire the mortgage debt, or shall terminate the ground or underlying lease, as the case may be; or (iii) the damage is not fully covered, except for deductible amounts, by Landlord's insurance policies (unless Tenant agrees, in writing, prior to Landlord's determination, to be responsible for any such incremental amounts that are not covered, and deposits such amounts with Landlord upon request). If 
 (A) Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to Landlord's termination right as provided above, (B) the damage constitutes a Tenant Damage Event (as defined below), and (C) Landlord's Restoration Work cannot, in the reasonable opinion of Landlord as set forth in Landlord's Damage Notice, be substantially completed within two hundred ten (210) days after the date of the damage, then Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease by delivering written notice thereof to Landlord within fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Damage Notice, which termination shall be effective as of the date of such termination notice thereof to Landlord. As used herein, a Tenant Damage Event shall mean damage to all or any part of the Premises or any common areas of the Building providing access to the Premises by fire or other casualty, which damage (1) is not the result of the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or any of Tenant's employees, agents, contractors, licensees or invitees, (2) substantially interferes with Tenant's use of or access to the Premises and (3) would entitle Tenant to an abatement of Rent pursuant to Section 11.1 above. In addition, if (x) the Premises, the Building or any portion of the Real Property is destroyed or damaged to any substantial extent during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term, (y) Tenant has not exercised any Extension Option that is still in effect, and does not exercise any such Extension Option within thirty (30) days after the date of Landlord's Damage Notice, and (3) Landlord's Restoration Work is reasonably estimated by Landlord in Landlord's Damage Notice to require more than sixty (60) days or the remainder of the Lease Term (whichever is less) to complete, then notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 11, Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease, and to the extent that such destruction or damage also constitutes a Tenant Damage Event, Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease, by giving written termination notice to the other party of the exercise of such option within thirty (30) days after such damage or destruction, in which event this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date of such notice. Upon any such termination of this Lease pursuant to this Section 11.2, Tenant shall pay the Base Rent and Additional Rent, properly apportioned up to such date of termination, and both parties hereto shall thereafter be discharged of all further obligations under this Lease, except for those obligations which expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. 
 11.3 Waiver of Statutory Provisions . The provisions of this Lease, including this Article 11, constitute an express agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction of, all or any part of the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Real Property, and any statute or regulation of the state in which the Real Property is located, including, without limitation, Sections 1932(2) and 1933(4) of the California 

17 

Civil Code, with respect to any rights or obligations concerning damage or destruction in the absence of an express agreement between the parties, and any other statute or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, shall have no application to this Lease or any damage or destruction to all or any part of the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Real Property. 
 
 ARTICLE 12

If more than fifteen percent (15 of the rentable square feet of the Building is taken, or if access to the Building or the Surface Parking Areas is substantially impaired, or if the portion of the Building that is taken substantially interferes with Tenant's use of the Premises for the permitted uses set forth in Section 5.1 above, then Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon ninety (90) days' notice, provided such notice is given no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such taking. Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award or payment in connection therewith, except that Tenant shall have the right to file any separate claim available to Tenant for any taking of Tenant's personal property and fixtures belonging to Tenant and removable by Tenant upon expiration of the Lease Term pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and for moving expenses, so long as such claim does not diminish the award available to Landlord, or its ground lessor or mortgagee with respect to the Real Property, and such claim is payable separately to Tenant. All Rent shall be apportioned as of the date of such termination, or the date of such taking, whichever shall first occur. If any part of the Premises shall be taken, and this Lease shall not be so terminated, the Base Rent and Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs shall be proportionately abated. Tenant hereby waives any and all rights it might otherwise have pursuant to Section 1265.130 of The California Code of Civil Procedure. 

12.2 Temporary Taking . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 12, in the event of a temporary taking of all or any portion of the Premises for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or less, then this Lease shall not terminate but the Base Rent and Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs shall be abated for the period of such taking in proportion to the ratio that the amount of rentable square feet of the Premises taken bears to the total rentable square feet of the Premises. Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award made in connection with any such temporary taking.

Tenant shall execute and deliver whatever other instruments may be reasonably required for such purposes. If Tenant fails to timely execute and deliver such estoppel certificate or other instruments, which failure continues for two (2) business days after Landlord provides a second (2 nd request in writing by Landlord, it shall (i) constitute an acceptance of the Premises, (ii) an acknowledgment by Tenant that statements included in the estoppel certificate are true and correct, without exception and , (iii) be a material default of the provisions of this Lease. In addition, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord, and shall indemnify Landlord from and against any loss, cost, damage or expense, incidental, consequential, or otherwise, including attorneys' fees, arising or accruing directly or indirectly, from any failure of Tenant to execute or deliver to Landlord any such estoppel certificate within two (2) business days after such second (2 nd request in writing by Landlord.

 1. Extension Option . Landlord hereby grants Tenant two (2) consecutive options (each, an Extension Option to extend the then-current Lease Term for a period of sixty (60) months (each, an Option Term ), which Extension Options shall each be exercisable only by written Exercise Notice (as defined below) delivered by Tenant to Landlord as provided below. Upon the proper exercise of the applicable Extension Option, the then-current Lease Term shall be extended for the applicable Option Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Landlord's option, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord under the Lease, at law or in equity, the applicable Extension Option shall not be deemed properly exercised if as of the date of delivery of the applicable Exercise Notice (as defined below) by Tenant for such applicable Extension Option, Tenant has previously been in default under the Lease beyond all applicable notice and cure periods. Each Extension Option is personal to the Original Tenant and any Affiliate Assignee, as the case may be, and may only be exercised by the Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee, as the case may be (and not any other assignee, sublessee or other transferee of Tenant's interest in the Lease) if the Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee, as the case may be, occupies at least seventy five percent (75 of the rentable square footage of the Premises as of the date of Tenant's delivery of the Exercise Notice for such applicable Extension Option. 

2. Option Rent . The annual Base Rent payable by Tenant during the applicable Option Term (the Option Rent shall be equal to the Fair Market Rental Rate for the Premises. As used herein, the Fair Market Rental Rate shall mean the annual base rent at which tenants, as of the commencement of the applicable Option Term, will be leasing full building, non-sublease space comparable in size, location and quality to the Premises for a comparable term as the applicable Option Term, which comparable space is located in other comparable first-class single story research and development buildings with at least 4,000 amps of power in the North San Jose, California market (collectively, the Comparable Buildings ), taking into consideration (i) the exterior amenity feature at the Premises, and (ii) all free rent and other out-of-pocket concessions generally being granted at such time for such comparable space for the applicable Option Term (including, without limitation, any tenant improvement allowance provided for such comparable space, with the amount of such tenant improvement allowance to be provided for the Premises during the applicable Option Term to be determined after taking into account the age, quality and layout of the tenant improvements in the Premises as of the commencement of the applicable Option Term with consideration given to the fact that the improvements existing in the Premises are specifically suitable to Tenant). All other terms and conditions of the Lease shall apply throughout the applicable Option Term; however, Tenant shall, in no event, have the option to extend the Lease Term beyond the second (2 nd Option Term described in Section 1 above. 

3. Exercise of Option . Each Extension Option shall be exercised by Tenant, if at all, only in the following manner: (i) Tenant shall deliver written notice Interest Notice to Landlord not more than twelve (12) months nor less than ten (10) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term, or the first Option Term, as the case may be, stating that Tenant may be interested in exercising the applicable Extension Option; 

(ii) Landlord, after receipt of the applicable Tenant's Interest Notice, shall deliver notice (the Option Rent Notice to Tenant not less than ten (10) business days after Tenant delivers the Interest Notice to Landlord, setting forth the applicable Option Rent; and (iii) if Tenant wishes to exercise the applicable Extension Option, Tenant shall, on or before the date (the Exercise Date which is nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term, or the first Option Term, as the case may be, exercise the applicable Extension Option by delivering written notice Exercise Notice thereof to Landlord. Concurrently with Tenant's delivery of the applicable Exercise Notice, Tenant may object, in writing, to Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate for the applicable Option Term set forth in the Option Rent Notice therefor, in which event such Fair Market Rental Rate shall be determined pursuant to Section 4 below. If Tenant timely delivers the applicable Exercise Notice for the applicable Extension Option but fails to timely object in writing to Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate set forth in the applicable Option Rent Notice therefor, then Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted Landlord's determination thereof and the following provisions of Section 4 shall not apply with respect to such applicable Option Term. Tenant's failure to deliver the applicable Interest Notice or applicable Exercise Notice on or before the applicable delivery dates therefore specified hereinabove shall be deemed to constitute Tenant's waiver of such applicable Extension Option and any subsequent Extension Option. 
 
 4. Determination of Option Rent . If Tenant timely and appropriately objects in writing pursuant to Section 3 above with respect to the Fair Market Rental Rate for the Premises initially determined by Landlord in the applicable Option Rent Notice, then Landlord and Tenant shall attempt to agree upon the applicable Fair Market Rental Rate, using their best good-faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement by the date (the Outside Agreement Date which is twenty (20) days following Tenant's delivery of the applicable Exercise Notice, then each party shall submit to the other party a separate written determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate within ten (10) business days after the applicable Outside Agreement Date, and such determinations shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4.1 through 4.7 below. The failure of Tenant or Landlord to submit a written determination of the applicable Fair Market Rental Rate within such 10-business day period shall conclusively be deemed to be such party's approval of such applicable Fair Market Rental Rate submitted within such 10-business day period by the other party. 

4.1 Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one (1) arbitrator who shall by profession be a real estate leasing broker who shall (i) have been active over the ten (10) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of the Comparable Buildings, (ii) have no financial interest in Landlord or Tenant, and (iii) not have represented or been employed or engaged by the appointing party during such 10-year period.

Each such arbitrator shall be appointed within fifteen (15) days after the applicable Outside Agreement Date. 

4.2 The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall, within fifteen (15) days of the date of the appointment of 

the last appointed arbitrator, agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two (2) arbitrators. 

4.3 The three (3) arbitrators shall, within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator, reach a decision as to which of Landlord's or Tenant's submitted applicable Fair Market Rental Rate is closer to the actual applicable Fair Market Rental Rate and shall select such closer determination as the applicable Fair Market Rental Rate and notify Landlord and Tenant thereof. 

4.4 The decision of the majority of the three (3) arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. 

4.5 If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an arbitrator within the time period specified in Section 4.1 hereinabove, the arbitrator appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify Landlord and Tenant thereof, and such arbitrator's decision shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. 

4.6 If the two (2) arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, a third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Superior Court in and for the county of in which the Real Property is located. 

4.7 Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of the arbitrator appointed by or on behalf of it, and each shall pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the third arbitrator, if any.

5. Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Landlord is entering into the Lease in material reliance upon the ability of Landlord to draw upon the Letter of Credit upon the occurrence of any default on the part of Tenant under the Lease.

Tenant agrees not to interfere in any way with payment to Landlord of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit, either prior to or following a draw by Landlord of any portion of the Letter of Credit, regardless of whether any dispute exists between Tenant and Landlord as to Landlord's right to draw from the Letter of Credit. The use, application, or retention of the Letter of Credit proceeds, or any portion thereof, by Landlord shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy provided by the Lease or by any applicable law, it being intended that Landlord shall not first be required to proceed against the Letter of Credit, and such Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof shall not operate as a limitation on any recovery to which Landlord may otherwise be entitled. No condition or term of the Lease shall be deemed to render the Letter of Credit conditional to justify the issuer of the Letter of Credit in failing to honor a drawing upon such Letter of Credit in a timely manner. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that: (i) the Letter of Credit constitutes a separate and independent contract between Landlord and the Bank; (ii) Tenant is not a third party beneficiary of such contract; and (iii) Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof and that, if Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenant's bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlord's claim and/or rights to the Letter of Credit and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b)(6) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 

6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time the Letter of Credit Issuer Requirements are not met, or if the financial condition of such issuer changes in any other materially adverse way, as determined by Landlord in its sole discretion, then, if permitted by Landlord in writing, in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion, Tenant shall, within five (5) business days after written notice from Landlord, deliver to Landlord a replacement Letter of Credit which otherwise meets the requirements of the Lease, including without limitation, the Letter of Credit Issuer Requirements. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the issuer of any letter of credit held by Landlord is insolvent or is placed in receivership or conservatorship by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any successor or similar entity, or if a trustee, receiver or liquidator is appointed for the issuer, then, effective as of the date of such occurrence, the Letter of Credit shall be deemed to not meet the requirements of this LC Rider, and, if permitted by Landlord in writing, in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion, Tenant shall, within five (5) business days after written notice from Landlord, deliver to Landlord a replacement Letter of Credit which otherwise meets the requirements of this LC Rider and that meets the Letter of Credit Issuer Requirements. Notwithstanding anything in the Lease to the contrary, if: (i) Tenant fails to (A) so replace the Letter of Credit (provided that the same was permitted by Landlord in writing, in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion, pursuant to the foregoing), and/or (B) satisfy the Letter of Credit Issuer Requirements within such applicable 5-day period; or (ii) Landlord elects, in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion, to not permit Tenant to replace the Letter of Credit, then, in each case, the same shall constitute a material default by Tenant under the Lease for which there shall be no notice or grace or cure periods being applicable thereto, and in such event, Landlord may, but without obligation to do so, draw upon the Letter of Credit in part or in whole, to cure such default and/or to compensate Landlord for any and all damages of any kind or nature sustained or which Landlord reasonably estimates that it will sustain resulting from such default (including, but not limited to, any damages arising upon the termination of the Lease under the Lease and Section 1951.2 of the California Civil Code). 

7. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that in no event or circumstance shall the Letter of Credit or any renewal thereof or any proceeds thereof be (i) deemed to be or treated as a security deposit within the meaning of California Civil Code Section 1950.7, (ii) subject to the terms of such Section 1950.7, or (iii) intended to serve as a security deposit within the meaning of such Section 1950.7. The parties hereto (A) recite that the Letter of Credit is not intended to serve as a security deposit and such Section 1950.7 and any and all other laws, rules and regulations applicable to security deposits in the commercial context Security Deposit Laws shall have no applicability or relevancy thereto, and (B) waive any and all rights, duties and obligations either party may now or, in the future, will have relating to or arising from the Security Deposit Laws. 

8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this LC Rider, it is hereby agreed that the LC Amount shall be reduced by and to the amounts on the date set forth in the schedule below, provided that: (i) no default on behalf of Tenant under the Lease or this LC Rider exists beyond any applicable notice and cure period as of the scheduled reduction; and (ii) Landlord has not drawn down in good faith on any portion of the Letter of Credit prior to such scheduled reduction date. Any such reductions in the LC Amount pursuant this Section 8 shall be accomplished through an amendment or, if permitted by Landlord in writing, in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion, a replacement Letter of Credit, to be provided by Tenant to Landlord at Tenant's expense. 

Reduction Date		Amount of Reduction		Revised LC Amount 
 
 Last day of the sixtieth (60th) month		 1,155,084.95		 844,915.05 
 			of the initial Lease Term	 

9. Tenant's sole and exclusive remedy in connection with any improper draw by Landlord against the Letter of Credit or Landlord's improper application or retention of any proceeds of the Letter of Credit shall be the right to obtain from Landlord a refund of the amount of any sight draft(s) that were improperly presented or the proceeds of which were misapplied or wrongfully held, together with interest at the Interest Rate and reasonable actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, provided that at the time of such refund, Tenant replenishes the amount of such Letter of Credit to the amount (if any) then required under the applicable provisions of this LC Rider. Tenant unconditionally and irrevocably waives (and as an independent covenant hereunder, covenants not to assert) any right to claim or obtain any of the following relief in connection with the Letter of Credit: (i) a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, permanent injunction, or other order that would prevent, restrain or restrict the presentment of sight drafts drawn under the Letter of Credit or the Bank's honoring or payment of sight draft(s); or (ii) any attachment, garnishment, or levy in any manner upon either any of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit or the obligations of the Bank (either before or after the presentment to the Bank of sight drafts drawn under the Letter of Credit) based on any theory whatever.
