 Allowance for Credit Losses Related to Financing Receivables 
 The Company calculates the allowance for credit losses considering several factors, including the aging of its financing receivables, historical credit loss and portfolio delinquency experience and current economic conditions. The Company also evaluates financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events that make it unlikely it will recover the amounts owed to it. In calculating such reserves, the Company evaluates expected cash flows, including estimated proceeds from disposition of collateral, and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. When a loss is considered probable on an individual financing receivable, a specific reserve is recorded.

 INFORMATION RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this quarterly report, in other documents we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), in our press releases, webcasts, conference calls, materials delivered to shareholders and other communications, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States federal securities laws. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the report, document, press release, webcast, call, materials or other communication in which they are made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those envisaged in the forward-looking statements include the following: 
 
 If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity, supply chain management or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions, customer demand and supply chain or transportation disruptions, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. 
 Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation. 
 Changes in our software and subscription businesses may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. 
 Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. 
 As of September 27, 2024, we have outstanding indebtedness of approximately 2.2 billion and the ability to incur an additional 750.0 million of indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility and in the future we may incur additional indebtedness. This indebtedness could adversely affect our businesses and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. 
 Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rates and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price. 
 Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements. 
 Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have sold could adversely affect our financial statements. 
 Conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements. 
 Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements. 
 Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations. 
 Defects, tampering, unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services (including software), or allegations thereof, could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. 
 Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. 
 Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. 
 If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. 
 23 

Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. 
 If we suffer a loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed. 
 Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented executives and other key employees is critical to our success. 
 Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. 
 Global economic, political, legal, compliance, supply chain, public health and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements and outlook. 
 Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements. 
 Changes in, or status of implementation of, industry standards and governmental regulations, including interpretation or enforcement thereof, may reduce demand for our products or services, increase our expenses or otherwise adversely impact our business model. 
 Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation. 
 We are party to asbestos-related product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. 
 Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. 
 We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements. 
 If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected. 
 We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 Changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional payments for prior periods. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding reasons that actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the report, document, press release, webcast, call, materials or other communication in which they are made. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.

Outlook 
 We expect core sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2024 to be lower than our longer-term growth expectations due to softening in certain of our end markets as further discussed below in Results of Operations . Our outlook is subject to various assumptions and risks, including but not limited to the resilience and durability of the economies of the United States and other critical regions, ongoing challenges with global logistics and supply chain including the availability of electronic components, the impact of international conflicts, including Russia-Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, market conditions in key end product segments, and the impact of energy disruption in Europe. Additional uncertainties are identified in Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements above and in Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We continue to monitor the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions which may impact our business, including monetary and fiscal policies, changes in the banking system, international trade and relations between the U.S., China and other nations, and investment and taxation policy initiatives being considered in the United States and by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD ). We also continue to monitor the Russia-Ukraine conflict and conflicts in the Middle East and the impact on our business and operations. As of the filing date of this report, we do not believe they are material.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Core Sales 
 
 We define core sales as total sales excluding (i) sales from acquired and certain divested businesses; (ii) the impact of currency translation; and (iii) certain other items. 
 
 References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested or exited businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations. 
 The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales, including foreign operations, (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. 
 The portion of sales attributable to other items is calculated as the impact of those items which are not directly correlated to core sales which do not have an impact on the current or comparable period. 
 
 Core sales should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, total sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 
 Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and certain divestiture-related items because the nature, size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation and certain other items from core sales because these items are either not under management s control or relate to items not directly correlated to core sales. Management believes the exclusion of these items from core sales may facilitate assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of long-term performance.

INTEREST COSTS 
 Interest expense, net was 18.9 million during the three months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 22.8 million for the comparable period in 2023, a decrease of 3.9 million, driven primarily by a decrease in our outstanding debt obligations. 
 Interest expense, net was 56.2 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 70.7 million for the comparable period in 2023, a decrease of 14.5 million, driven primarily by a decrease in our outstanding debt obligations and an increase in interest income between periods. 
 For a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness, refer to Note 4. Financing to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 Effective Tax Rate 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 was 18.3 and 18.6 , respectively, as compared to 24.4 and 24.6 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2024 as compared to the comparable period in the prior year was primarily due to a favorable change in uncertain tax position reserves during the three months ended September 27, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 as compared to the comparable period in the prior year was primarily due to the favorable tax impacts of the divestiture of the Coats business and a favorable change in uncertain tax position reserves during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and the unfavorable tax impacts of the divestiture of the Global Traffic Technologies business during the nine months ended September 29, 2023. 
 
 Pillar Two 
 
 The OECD agreed among over 130 countries on the Pillar Two proposals which establish a global minimum effective tax rate of 15 for multinational groups with annual global revenue exceeding 750 million. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two proposals, including the European Union EU Member States which unanimously adopted the EU Pillar Two Directive, providing for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 . EU Member States are required to enact the EU Pillar Two Directive into their national laws by December 31, 2023, with effective dates of January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, respectively, for different aspects of the EU Pillar Two Directive.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. As of September 27, 2024, we held 330.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and had 750.0 million of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to continue to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund our restructuring activities and pension plans as required, invest in existing businesses, consummate strategic acquisitions, manage our capital structure on a short and long-term basis and support other business needs or objectives. We also have purchase obligations which consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of September 27, 2024, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs. 
 Our long-term debt requires, among others, that we maintain certain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all of these covenants as of September 27, 2024. 
 2024 Financing and Capital Transactions 
 During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we completed the following financing and capital transactions: 
 Voluntarily repaid 100.0 million of the Three-Year Term Loans Due 2024; 
 Repurchased 3.0 million shares for 100.0 million through an accelerated share repurchase ASR agreement; 
 Repurchased 1.6 million shares for 64.6 million in the open market.

 Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity 
 Following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity: Nine Months Ended in millions) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 259.4 290.1 Proceeds from sale of business, net of cash provided 68.4 107.5 Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (62.6) (43.5) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 1.3 4.3 Cash paid for equity investments (2.3) (2.7) Proceeds from sale of equity securities 0.2 20.4 Net cash provided by investing activities 5.0 86.0 Repayment of long-term debt (100.0) (240.0) Net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term borrowings (1.2) 1.4 Payments of common stock cash dividend (11.5) (11.7) Purchases of treasury stock (164.6) (61.6) Proceeds from stock option exercises 14.4 6.0 Other financing activities (13.9) (7.4) Net cash used in financing activities (276.8) (313.3)

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and other items impact reported cash flows. 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities were 259.4 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, a decrease of 30.7 million, as compared to the comparable period in 2023. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors: 
 The aggregate of accounts receivable and long-term financing receivables used 46.2 million of operating cash flows during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to using 33.6 million in the comparable period of 2023. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by accounts receivable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections in a period. Additionally, when we originate certain financing receivables, we assume the financing receivable by decreasing the franchisee s trade accounts receivable. As a result, originations of certain financing receivables are non-cash transactions. 
 The aggregate of other operating assets and liabilities used 69.3 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to using 16.8 million in the comparable period of 2023. This change is due primarily to working capital needs and the timing of accruals and payments and tax-related amounts. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 5.0 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, driven primarily by proceeds from the sale of our Coats business, partially offset by payments for additions to property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was 86.0 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, driven primarily by proceeds from the sale of our Global Traffic Technologies business and equity securities, partially offset by payments for additions to property, plant and equipment. 
 We made capital expenditures of 62.6 million and 43.5 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 276.8 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, driven primarily by the voluntary repayment of 100.0 million of the Three-Year Term Loans due 2024 and repurchases of the Company s common stock of 164.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities was 313.3 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, driven primarily by the voluntary repayment of 240.0 million of the Three-Year Term Loans due 2024 and repurchases of the Company s common stock of 61.6 million. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 Refer to Note 11. Capital Stock and Earnings per Share to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for a description of the Company s share repurchase program. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 We paid regular quarterly cash dividends of 0.025 per share during the nine months ended September 27, 2024. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions. 
 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had 1.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of the Registered Notes and 600.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Term Loans.

 PURPOSE AND TERM 
 Section 1.01 Purpose of the Plan . The purpose of the Plan is to provide Eligible Employees with certain compensation and benefits as set forth in the Plan in the event the Eligible Employee s employment with the Company is terminated, or in the event of a Change in Control. 
 The benefits provided in connection with a Change in Control are intended to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Eligible Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control, and to incentivize Eligible Employees to pursue good faith negotiation of transactions that are in the best interest of the Company s shareholders. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Eligible Employee by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change in Control to encourage the Eligible Employee s full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change in Control and to provide the Eligible Employee with competitive compensation and benefits arrangements for a limited period following a Change in Control. 
 The Plan is not intended to be an employee pension benefit plan or pension plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA. Rather, the severance provisions of this Plan are intended to be a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA and to meet the descriptive requirements of a plan constituting a severance pay plan within the meaning of regulations published by the Secretary of Labor at Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, section 2510.3-2(b). Accordingly, the Severance Benefits paid by the Plan are not deferred compensation and no employee shall have a vested right to such benefits. 
 Section 1.02 Term of the Plan . The Plan shall generally be effective as of the Effective Date, but subject to amendment from time to time in accordance with Section 7.01. The Plan shall continue until terminated pursuant to Article VII of the Plan.

For purposes of this Section 5.06, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. To the extent necessary to eliminate an excess parachute amount that would not be deductible by the Company for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Code, the amounts payable or benefits to be provided to the Participant shall be reduced such that the economic loss to the Participant as a result of the excess parachute amount elimination is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero. 
 (b) If the Firm (as defined in Section 5.06(c)) determines that the payments to the Participant (before any reductions as described in Section 5.06(a)) on an after-tax basis (i.e., after federal, state and local income and excise taxes and federal employment taxes) would exceed the Reduced Amount on an after-tax basis (i.e., after federal, state and local income and federal employment taxes) then such payments will not be reduced as described in Section 5.06(a). 
 (c) All determinations required to be made under this Section 5.06 shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting or consulting firm selected by the Chief People Officer of the Company (or the equivalent) upon the occurrence of a Potential Change in Control (the Firm ), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within fifteen (15) business days of the Separation from Service Date or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. Any such determination by the Firm shall be binding upon the Company, its successors and the Participant (subject to Section 5.06(e) below). At the next regularly scheduled payroll date occurring at least five (5) business days after the determination by the Firm as to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall provide to the Participant such Payments as are then due to the Participant in accordance with the rights afforded under this Plan or any other applicable plan. 
 (d) The Company shall reimburse the Participant for any costs or expenses of tax counsel incurred by the Participant in connection with any audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, or any state or local tax authorities, concerning the application of Code Section 280G to any Payments (provided, that the Participant retains tax counsel acceptable to the Company). In the event that as a result of any such audit or investigation, the reduction in Plan Payments under Section 5.06(a) above is finally determined not to be sufficient in amount to permit the deduction by the Company of all Payments under Code Section 280G, then the Company shall pay the Participant an additional amount which shall be sufficient to put the Participant, after payment of any additional income, employment and excise taxes, interest and penalties, in substantially the same economic position as if the reduction had been sufficient. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any reimbursement or payment pursuant to this Section 5.06(d) shall be made in a manner, and in such timeframe, that complies with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(v). 
 (e) In the event that the Firm determines that a reduction effected pursuant to Section 5.06(a) above was excessive in amount due to changes in relevant data or information following its original determination under Section 5.06(c) above, and that additional Plan Payments could have been made thereunder, the Company shall promptly make such additional payments to the Participant
