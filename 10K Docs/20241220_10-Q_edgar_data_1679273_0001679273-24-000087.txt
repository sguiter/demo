 Restructuring Plan 
 On October 1, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan that is designed to drive operational and cost efficiencies and improve cash flows. The Restructuring Plan includes the permanent closure of a manufacturing facility, the temporary curtailment of certain production lines and schedules across our manufacturing network in North America, and reductions in employee headcount, other operating expenses, and capital expenditures. 
 In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we expect to recognize total pre-tax charges of 190 million to 210 million. Any changes to estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations in future periods. We expect actions in connection with the Restructuring Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We estimate that the Restructuring Plan will generate approximately 55 million in pre-tax cost savings and reduce working capital in fiscal 2025.

 Executive Summary 
 In a challenging operating environment, we delivered second quarter financial results that were below our expectations, largely due to higher-than-expected manufacturing costs and softer-than-expected volumes, while our results for price/mix and operating expenses were broadly in line with our expectations. 
 We expect challenging conditions to persist through the remainder of fiscal 2025, as weak restaurant traffic trends and incremental french fry capacity expansions have added to an imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside of North America. 
 We expect our earnings in the second half of fiscal 2025 will decline as compared to the prior year period as a result of investments in price, costs associated with the Restructuring Plan, and higher manufacturing costs per pound will more than offset volume growth and cost-savings initiatives. We anticipate that input costs, in the aggregate, will continue to rise, but at a more moderate rate compared to the first half of fiscal 2025. We expect that an increase in SG A and Restructuring expense will primarily reflect charges associated with the Restructuring Plan, incremental non-cash amortization of prior investments in our ERP infrastructure, and inflation, though we expect this increase will be partially offset by cost savings from the Restructuring Plan and other cost-savings initiatives. 
 We continue to take prudent steps to adapt to the dynamic operating environment. In addition to the cost benefits we expect to realize from our Restructuring Plan, we are evaluating other cost-saving and productivity initiatives to improve our operating efficiency, profitability, and cash flows, while also positioning us to continue to support our customers and create value for our stakeholders over the long-term.

 Net Sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended (in millions, except percentages) November 24, 2024 November 26, 2023 Increase (Decrease) Segment net sales North America 1,072.1 1,167.1 (8) International 528.8 565.0 (6) 1,600.9 1,732.1 (8) Segment Adjusted EBITDA North America 266.7 321.3 (17) International 47.4 100.2 (53) 
 Net Sales 
 Compared to the prior year quarter, net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 declined 131.2 million, or 8 , to 1,600.9 million. 
 Volume declined 6 , largely reflecting the impact of soft global restaurant traffic trends; customer share losses, net of gains; and the carryover effect of our decision in the prior year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe to strategically manage customer and product mix. Price/mix declined 2 , reflecting planned investments in price and trade support to attract and retain volume in North America, pricing actions in key international markets in response to a more competitive environment, and unfavorable channel and product mix. The decline in price/mix was partially offset by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in EMEA. 
 North America segment net sales, which includes all sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, declined 95.0 million, or 8 , to 1,072.1 million. Volume declined 5 , largely reflecting the impact of declining restaurant traffic in the U.S. and customer share losses in away-from-home channels. Price/mix declined 3 , due to planned investments in price and trade support across all sales channels to attract and retain volume, as well as unfavorable channel and product mix. 
 International segment net sales, which includes all sales to customers outside of North America, declined 36.2 million, or 6 , to 528.8 million. Volume declined 6 , largely reflecting declining or softening restaurant traffic in key international markets; the impact of customer share losses, net of gains; and the carryover effect of our decision in the prior year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe. Price/mix was flat with the prior year quarter as pricing actions in key international markets, in response to a more competitive environment, were offset by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in EMEA. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit declined 197.8 million versus the prior year quarter to 277.8 million, and included 75.5 million of pre-tax charges 57.4 million after-tax, or 0.40 per share) related to the Restructuring Plan, and 9.8 million 7.3 million after-tax, or 0.05 per share) of unrealized gains related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity hedging contracts. The prior year quarter included 4.6 million 3.5 million after-tax, or 0.02 per share) of unrealized losses related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity hedging contracts, and 1.8 million of benefit 1.3 million after-tax, or 0.01 per share) associated with the sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value following our acquisition of the remaining interest in Lamb-Weston/Meijer v.o.f. LW EMEA ), our former joint venture in Europe.

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted Gross Profit declined 134.9 million versus the prior year quarter to 343.5 million due to unfavorable price/mix, higher manufacturing costs per pound, and lower sales volumes. The higher manufacturing costs per pound largely reflected input cost inflation, which was primarily driven by higher raw potato costs; utilization-related production costs and inefficiencies; higher transportation and warehousing costs; and 15.8 million of higher depreciation expense largely associated with our recent capacity expansions in China and the U.S. Manufacturing costs in the prior year quarter included a 64.6 million pre-tax charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A increased 14.7 million versus the prior year quarter to 184.7 million including a gain of 3.3 million (before and after-tax, or 0.02 per share) related to blue chip swap transactions in Argentina; 9.6 million 7.2 million after-tax, or 0.05 per share) of foreign currency exchange losses; 12.8 million 9.5 million after-tax, or 0.07 per share) of unrealized losses related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency hedging contracts; and 0.4 million 0.3 million after-tax, no per share impact) of expenses related to ongoing shareholder activism matters. The prior year quarter included a gain of 7.1 million 5.3 million after-tax, or 0.04 per share) related to blue chip swap transactions in Argentina; 2.1 million 1.6 million after-tax, or 0.01 per share) of foreign currency exchange gains; 3.0 million 2.2 million after-tax, or 0.01 per share) of unrealized gains related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency hedging contracts; and 4.8 million of LW EMEA integration and acquisition-related expenses 3.6 million after-tax, or 0.02 per share). 
 Adjusted SG A declined 12.2 million versus the prior year quarter to 165.2 million, despite including an incremental 6.5 million of non-cash amortization and expense related to our new ERP system. Savings from expense reduction initiatives, including savings associated with the Restructuring Plan, lower performance-based compensation and benefits accruals, and lower investments in information technology more than offset inflation. 
 Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net income declined 251.1 million from the prior year quarter to a loss of 36.1 million. Net loss in the current quarter included 130.6 million 168.8 million before tax, or 0.91 per share) of gains resulting from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, foreign currency exchange losses, and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses, and other items impacting comparability. Net income in the prior year quarter included total net gains of 3.3 million 4.6 million before tax, or 0.03 per share) for blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, foreign currency exchange losses, unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses, and a benefit associated with the sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value following the completion of our acquisition of the remaining interest in LW EMEA. 
 Adjusted EBITDA declined 95.0 million versus the prior year quarter to 281.9 million, primarily due to lower net sales and Adjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted EBITDA in the prior year quarter included a 70.9 million pre-tax charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, of which 6.3 million was recorded in Equity Method Investment Earnings. 
 North America Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined 54.6 million versus the prior year quarter to 266.7 million. Unfavorable price/mix, lower sales volumes, and higher manufacturing costs per pound largely drove the decline. North America Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the prior year quarter included a 63.3 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. 
 International Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined 52.8 million versus the prior year quarter to 47.4 million. Higher manufacturing costs per pound and lower volume largely drove the decline. International Segment Adjusted EBITDA in the prior year quarter included a 7.6 million allocated charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased 14.2 million, versus the prior year quarter, to 43.3 million, reflecting the impact of higher total debt outstanding and lower capitalized interest related to our manufacturing expansion projects.

 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 13.4 million and 66.2 million, respectively. During the current quarter we recorded a 38.2 million tax benefit related to gains resulting from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, foreign currency exchange losses, unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses, and other items impacting comparability, which included a 35.5 million tax benefit related to Restructuring Plan charges, and a 14.4 million discrete tax expense, primarily related to the establishment of a non-cash full valuation allowance against certain international deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2025 was (59.0) , versus 23.5 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of the items above, our effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 25.5 versus 23.5 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with the increase largely due to a higher proportion of earnings in our International segment. 
 Equity Method Investment Earnings 
 Equity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures were 2.1 million and 4.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The results in the current quarter include 9.0 million 6.9 million after-tax, or 0.05 per share) of costs related to the Restructuring Plan. Excluding this item, Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings increased 6.4 million compared to the prior year quarter. Equity method investment earnings in the prior year quarter included a 6.3 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. The results for the current and prior year quarters reflect earnings associated with our 50 interest in Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen, an unconsolidated potato processing joint venture in Minnesota Lamb Weston RDO ).

 Volume declined 4 , largely reflecting the impact of soft global restaurant traffic trends; customer share losses, net of gains; the carryover effect of our decision in the prior year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe; and the impact of a previously announced voluntary product withdrawal initiated in late fiscal 2024. Price/mix was flat as compared to the prior year period, reflecting planned investments in price and trade support in North America to attract and retain volume, pricing actions in key international markets in response to a more competitive environment, and unfavorable channel and product mix, offsetting the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in Europe. 
 North America segment net sales declined 126.7 million, or 6 , to 2,175.8 million. Volume declined 5 , largely reflecting the impact of customer share losses, net of gains, and declining restaurant traffic in the U.S. Price/mix declined 1 , reflecting planned investments in price and trade support across all sales channels, as well as unfavorable channel and product mix, more than offsetting the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 for contracts with large and regional chain restaurant customers.

 International segment net sales declined 15.7 million, or 1 , to 1,079.2 million. Volume declined 2 , reflecting the impact of soft global restaurant traffic trends; customer share losses, net of gains; and the carryover effect of our decision in the prior year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe. The decline was partially offset by volume growth in key international markets outside of Europe. Price/mix increased 1 reflecting the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in Europe, partially offset by pricing actions in key international markets in response to a more competitive environment. 
 Gross Profit

 Cash Flows 
 Below is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities: 
 Twenty-Six Weeks Ended (in millions) November 24, 2024 November 26, 2023 Net cash flows provided by (used for): Operating activities 429.3 455.2 Investing activities (484.9) (570.8) Financing activities 63.3 (112.0) 7.7 (227.6) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (0.1) 1.1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 7.6 (226.5) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 71.4 304.8 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 79.0 78.3 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities declined 25.9 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 versus the prior year to 429.3 million. The decline largely relates to 273.0 million decrease in income from operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expenses, largely offset by a favorable increase of 247.1 million in working capital, primarily related to timing of accounts payable related to capital expenditures and expenses related to the Restructuring Plan, accrued liabilities, and receipts of accounts receivable. See Results of Operations in this MD A for more information related to the decrease in income from operations. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used 484.9 million of cash in the first half of fiscal 2025, compared with 570.8 million in the same period in the prior year. Expenditures in both periods primarily related to our investments to expand our french fry capacity and other facility modernization efforts in China, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Argentina. The projects in China and the U.S. were completed during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. The project in the Netherlands was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, while the project in Argentina is on track to be completed by mid-calendar 2025. In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we decreased our estimate of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 by 100 million to 750 million excluding acquisitions, which included pausing the next phase of our ERP build and implementation. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the first half of fiscal 2025, we borrowed 520.2 million under new long-term debt facilities, which included our new 500 million Term A-5 loan facility. These funds were used primarily to repay the Term A-1 loan facility and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In the aggregate, we used 92.8 million of cash to repurchase 1,412,852 shares of our common stock at an average price of 58.04 per share, and we withheld 187,735 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid 103.3 million in cash dividends to common stockholders. 
 In the first half of fiscal 2024 , we used an aggregate of 164.3 million of cash to repurchase 1,564,351 shares of our common stock at an average price of 95.89 per share, and we withheld 134,340 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid 81.6 million of cash dividends to our common stockholders and repaid 27.7 million of other debt and financing obligations. These financing uses were partially offset by 162.1 million of borrowings during the period primarily under our revolving credit facility.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG A, Adjusted Restructuring Expense, and Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in analyzing what management views as our core operating performance for purposes of business decision making. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful supplemental information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses and other items affecting comparability between periods, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our core operating performance across periods, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial results. In addition, we believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affecting our underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP that are also presented in this report. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, gross profit, SG A, equity method investment earnings, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way we do.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, we may periodically enter into derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, but not for trading purposes. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of November 24, 2024 and May 26, 2024. Actual results may differ materially. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. We may use commodity swap or forward purchase contracts, in addition to sourcing from multiple providers, to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in oil and energy prices. Based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of November 24, 2024, a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would have resulted in a charge to Cost of sales of 8.8 million 6.6 million after-tax). Based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of May 26, 2024, a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would have resulted in a charge to Cost of sales of 9.2 million 6.9 million after-tax). We expect that any change in the fair value of these contracts, real or hypothetical, would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. Our operations in foreign countries export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on our financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of our international operations local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of exports out of the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). The currency that has the most impact is the Euro. From time to time, we may economically hedge currency risk with foreign currency contracts, such as forward contracts. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curre ncies, we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of 73.9 million 56.2 million after-tax) and 63.3 million 48.1 million after-tax) as of November 24, 2024 and May 26, 2024, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions, and from time to time, we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage risk. At November 24, 2024, we had million of fixed-rate and million of variable-rate debt outstanding. At May 26, 2024, we had 2,495.0 million of fixed-rate and 1,341.7 million of variable-rate debt outstanding. We have interest rate risk associated with our variable-rate debt. A one percent increase in interest rates related to variable-rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 11.2 million annually 8.6 million after-tax) and 13.6 million annually 10.6 million after-tax) at November 24, 2024 and May 26, 2024, respectively. 
 For more information about our market risks, see Note 10, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Due to these limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks, including that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of November 24, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
