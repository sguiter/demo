 SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Our business is subject to numerous material and other risks and uncertainties that you should be aware of in evaluating our business. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: We may not be successful in consummating the Merger . If we are successful in completing the Merger, we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks. If the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation and the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities. Failure to complete the Merger may result in either Jade or us paying a termination fee to the other party and could harm our common stock price and the future business and operations of each company. Some of Jade s and our executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that are different from yours. We are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. The results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. We have six issued U.S. patents and many pending patent applications with respect to AV-101, however, we have begun the process of abandoning our patent estate and we are no longer prosecuting our patent applications. Further, we can provide no assurance that any of our future patent applications will result in issued patents. If we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may develop products similar or identical to ours, and we may not be able to compete effectively in our market or successfully commercialize any product candidates we may develop. We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization of any product candidates and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations. 
 Unfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The material and other risks summarized above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors below and in the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. If any such material and other risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks summarized above or described in full under Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains express or implied forward-looking statements that are based on our management s belief and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future operational or financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: anticipated expenses and cost savings in connection with our discontinuation of development of AV-101; the proposed merger with Jade Biosciences, Inc., and related transactions; estimates of our future expenses, revenues, capital requirements and our needs for additional financing; our expectations for clinical and regulatory development plans; our expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for any product candidates we may develop; our ability to identify products, product candidates or technologies with significant commercial potential that are consistent with our commercial objectives; the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates, including the projected terms of patent protection; potential regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; developments relating to our competitors and our industry, including the impact of government laws and regulations; our ability to retain key management personnel in order to operate our business following announcement of our workforce reduction plan and the proposed merger with Jade Biosciences, Inc., and related transactions; 
 our ability to obtain additional funding for our operations, if needed, should we decide to pursue development of other product candidates; and other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under the section titled Risk Factors. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, intends, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those listed above under Summary of the Material Risks Associated with Our Business and under the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as exhibits hereto completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should therefore not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business and the markets for our product candidates. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances that are assumed in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry, business, market, and other data from our own internal estimates and research as well as from reports, research surveys, studies, and similar data prepared by market research firms and other third parties, industry, medical and general publications, government data and similar sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding any third-party information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, their estimates, in particular as they relate to projections, involve numerous assumptions, are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), (a) each then-outstanding share of Jade s common stock, par value per share, will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company s common stock, based on a ratio calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the Exchange Ratio ), provided that any unvested restricted shares of Jade common stock will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, vesting and repurchase provisions) that are otherwise applicable to such unvested shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) each then-outstanding share of Jade s preferred stock, par value per share, will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company s newly authorized convertible preferred stock, par value per share, equal to (x) the Exchange Ratio divided by (y) , (c) each then-outstanding option to purchase Jade common stock will be assumed by the Company, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement and (d) each then-outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Jade common stock or Jade preferred stock will be assumed by the Company, subject to adjust as set forth in the Merger Agreement. On October 30, 2024, Jade entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with certain existing Jade stockholders and new investors (the Investors ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Jade agreed to sell, and the Investors agreed to purchase, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, shares of Jade common stock and pre-funded warrants (together, the Securities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million (collectively, the Concurrent Investment ), which reflects the conversion of the previously issued million of convertible notes. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by such agreements is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement. Shares of Jade Common Stock and pre-funded warrants issued pursuant to this financing transaction will be converted into shares of common stock of the Company and pre-funded warrants to acquire shares of common stock of the Company, in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Agreement. The Company s future operations are highly dependent on the success of the Merger and there can be no assurances that the Merger will be successfully consummated. In the event that the Company does not complete the transaction with Jade, the Company may explore strategic alternatives, including, without limitation, another strategic transaction and/or pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the Company.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company. Our initial focus was on advancing AV 101, our dry powder inhaled formulation of imatinib for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a devastating disease impacting approximately 70,000 people in the United States and Europe. On June 17, 2024, we announced topline results from the Phase 2b portion of our Phase 2b/Phase 3 Inhaled Imatinib Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Clinical Trial of AV-101, or IMPAHCT. Topline data showed that, while AV-101 was generally well tolerated across all dose groups, the study did not meet its primary endpoint for improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance compared to placebo for any of the studied doses or show meaningful improvements in the secondary endpoint of change in six minute walk distance. We also reviewed data from several additional secondary endpoints of the Phase 2b portion of IMPAHCT, which also failed to show meaningful improvements. Based upon these results and in agreement with the independent study advisory committee, we halted enrollment and shut down the Phase 3 portion of IMPAHCT as well as the long-term extension study. AV-101 for the treatment of PAH was our only product candidate in development. At this time, we do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or any other product candidates. In July 2024, we announced the decision to conduct a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. We also engaged Wedbush Securities Inc. (Wedbush PacGrow) as our exclusive strategic financial advisor to assist in the process of exploring strategic alternatives, which may include but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, business combination, liquidation or other transaction. Recent Developments In June 2024, following our decision to halt further development of AV-101, we announced our plan to terminate nearly all of our workforce in the coming months, or the Workforce Reduction Plan. As of September 30, 2024, 46 individuals, or approximately 90 of our workforce, have been terminated. The affected individuals have been and will be provided severance benefits, including cash severance payments. Each affected individual s eligibility for severance benefits is contingent upon entering into a separation agreement, which includes a general release of claims against our company. In connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan, we incurred costs (in consideration of releases) of approximately 6.4 million, which are primarily one-time severance benefits. On October 30, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, by and among us, Caribbean Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub I, Caribbean Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub II and together with Merger Sub I, Merger Subs, and Jade Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Jade, pursuant to which, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Jade, with Jade surviving the merger as the surviving corporation, or the First Merger, and as part of the same overall transaction, Jade will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II continuing as our wholly owned subsidiary and the surviving corporation of the merger, or the Second Merger and together with the First Merger, the Merger. The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, in connection with the closing of the Merger, or the Closing, we expect to declare a cash dividend to our pre-Merger stockholders of approximately 65.0 million in the aggregate, or the Cash Dividend, provided such amount is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, or the Effective Time, (a) each then-outstanding share of Jade s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, or Jade Common Stock, will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, or Aerovate Common Stock, based on a ratio calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement, or the Exchange Ratio, provided that any unvested restricted shares of Jade Common Stock will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, vesting and repurchase provisions) that are otherwise applicable to such unvested shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) each then-outstanding share of Jade s preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share, or Jade Preferred Stock, will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of our newly authorized convertible preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share, equal to (x) the Exchange Ratio divided by (y) 1,000, (c) each then-outstanding option to purchase Jade Common Stock will be assumed by us, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement and (d) each then-outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Jade Common Stock or Jade Preferred Stock will be assumed by us, subject to adjust as set forth in the Merger Agreement. We and Jade have each agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) obtaining the requisite approval of our respective stockholders, (2) non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals and (3) the conduct of our respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the Closing. On October 30, 2024, Jade entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with certain existing Jade stockholders and new investors, or the Investors. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Jade agreed to sell, and the Investors agreed to purchase, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, shares of Jade Common Stock and pre-funded warrants for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 300.0 million, or the Concurrent Investment, which reflects the conversion of the previously issued 95 million of convertible notes. The consummation of the Concurrent Investment is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement. Shares of Jade Common Stock and pre-funded warrants issued pursuant to this financing transaction will be converted into shares of Aerovate Common Stock and pre-funded warrants to acquire shares of Aerovate Common Stock, in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, (1) requisite approval by our stockholders, (2) approval by the requisite Jade stockholders of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (3) Nasdaq s approval of the listing of the shares of Aerovate Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, and (4) an executed Purchase Agreement for the Concurrent Investment in full force and effect evidencing cash proceeds of not less than 80.0 million to be received by the combined company immediately prior to or following the Closing. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of each of us and Jade. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Jade a termination fee of 2,340,000, and in certain other circumstances, Jade may be required to pay us a termination fee of 5,250,000. At the Effective Time, our board of directors of is expected to consist of six members, all of whom will be designated by Jade. Concurrently and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, (i) certain stockholders of Jade (solely in their respective capacities as Jade stockholders) holding approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of Jade capital stock have entered into support agreements with us and Jade to vote all of their shares of Jade capital stock in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) certain of our stockholders holding approximately 38.1 of the outstanding shares of Aerovate Common Stock have entered into support agreements with us and Jade to vote all of their shares of Aerovate Common Stock in favor of, among other things, the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

 At-The-Market Offering On April 5, 2023, we entered into an ATM Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with BofA Securities, Inc., or the Agent, pursuant to which we established an at-the-market offering program, or ATM Program, to sell, from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of 75.0 million of shares of our common stock, through the Agent, as our sales agent. As of September 30, 2024, 3,462,721 shares have been sold under the Sales Agreement, generating 67.9 million of net proceeds after deducting commissions to the Agent and other offering costs. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, up to 6.0 million of shares of our common stock remain available for sale from time to time under the Sales Agreement. Components of Results of Operations Revenue We currently have no products approved for sale, and we have not generated any revenue to date. At this time, we do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or any other product candidates, and as a result, we currently do not anticipate generating revenue. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of any future drug candidates we may pursue. If we do not resume development activities or if we resume development but fail to obtain regulatory approval for any future drug candidates, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected. Operating Expenses Research and Development Prior to mid-June, our research and development expenses have related to the development of AV 101. Since our decision to halt further development of AV-101, we have also incurred costs related to shutting down our clinical trials and research and development operations. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. Research and development expenses include: external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, and consultants to conduct and support clinical trials of AV-101 and our preclinical studies; costs related to manufacturing AV-101 for use in clinical trials; personnel-related costs, including salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, stock-based compensation charges and severance, for those individuals involved in research and development efforts; and costs related to shutting down clinical trials of AV-101. 
 Our research and development expenses consist principally of direct costs, such as fees paid to CROs, investigative sites and consultants in connection with our clinical trials, preclinical and non-clinical studies, and costs related to manufacturing clinical trial materials. We deploy our personnel related resources across all of our research and development activities. We track direct expenses on a clinical and non-clinical basis. The successful development of any future product candidates is highly uncertain. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that would be necessary to complete the potential development and commercialization of any future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of potential future product

 candidates, if approved. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of: 
 per patient trial costs; the number of trials required for approval; the number of sites included in the trials; the countries in which the trials are conducted; the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of doses evaluated in the trials; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate. 
 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, stock-based compensation and severance charges for those individuals in executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, and insurance costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease for the second half of 2024 as we decrease the size of our organization in connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan. Our future general and administrative expenses will be significantly dependent on our ability to successfully consummate the Merger, related audit and legal expenses and whether we decide to pursue any future product development efforts. Interest Income Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Results of Operations Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited) The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

The decrease of 6.6 million was primarily due to a 4.3 million decrease in contract manufacturing costs, a 2.0 million decrease in clinical trial costs, a 2.0 million decrease in base wages and bonus expense, and a 1.4 million decrease in stock based compensation expense, partially offset by a 2.6 million increase in severance expense, a 0.4 million increase in regulatory and other expenses, and a 0.1 million increase in payroll taxes. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.1 million compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.6 million was primarily due to a 1.6 million increase in legal and consulting expenses, 1.1 million in severance expense, 0.1 million in stock based compensation expense, and 0.1 million in insurance and other costs, partially offset by a decrease of 0.4 million in base wages and bonus expense. Total Other Income Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.2 million compared to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase of 3.6 million was primarily due to a 1.3 million increase in severance expense, 1.2 million in stock compensation expense, 1.4 million in legal and consulting expenses, 0.1 million in rent allocation, and 0.2 million in insurance and other costs, partially offset by a decrease of 0.6 million in base wages and bonus expense. Total Other Income (Expense) Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.0 million compared to 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.2 million was due to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources From our inception through September 30, 2024, we have received aggregate net proceeds of 79.8 million from the sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock and 5.0 million from convertible promissory notes to related parties. In July 2021, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, with aggregate net proceeds from the offering of 126.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. On October 30. 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, Merger Sub I will merge with and into Jade, with Jade surviving the first merger as the surviving corporation and as part of the same overall transaction, Jade will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II continuing as our wholly owned subsidiary and the surviving corporation of the second merger. The closing of the Merger is subject to approval by our stockholders and the stockholders of Jade and other customary closing conditions. Our future operations are highly dependent on the success of the proposed Merger with Jade. At-the-Market Offering On April 5, 2023, we entered into the Sales Agreement with the Agent, pursuant to which we can sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of 75.0 million of shares of our common stock, through the Agent, as our sales agent. As of September 30, 2024, 3,462,721 shares have been sold under the Sales Agreement, generating 67.9 million of net proceeds after deducting commissions to the Agent and other offering costs. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, up to 6.0 million of shares of our common stock remain available for sale from time to time under the Sales Agreement.

 Future Funding Requirements As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 88.7 million. We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the costs and timing of the Merger; our ability to successfully consummate the Merger; 
 the costs and timing of any future product development efforts; the costs associated with retaining key personnel and consultants, and hiring additional personnel should we decide to resume development activities; the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; the timing and amount of the milestone or other payments we must make to any future licensors, if we enter into any license agreements; the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if a product candidate is approved; our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third- party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; patients ability and willingness to pay out-of-pocket costs for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 
 We expect to finance our cash needs through our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. However, we may be unable to enter into arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our drug candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such drug candidates ourselves.

 Lease Obligations In August 2021, we entered into a lease agreement, or the Waltham Lease, for approximately 5,000 square feet of office space in Waltham, Massachusetts. The base rent under the Waltham Lease is 43.00 per rentable square foot, or approximately 18,000 per month and is subject to scheduled annual increases of 1.00 per rentable square foot during the lease term. In January 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Waltham Lease resulting in the lease expiring on December 31, 2025, and an increase of 1.00 per rentable square foot during the additional lease term. In obtaining this lease extension, the Company no longer has the option to extend the Waltham Lease for one additional period of three years. In April 2022, we entered into a lease agreement, or the Foster City Lease, for approximately 3,500 square feet of office space in Foster City, California. The base rent under the Foster City Lease is 76.80 per rentable square foot, or approximately 22,600 per month and is subject to scheduled annual increases of 3 on each annual anniversary during the lease term. The term of the Foster City Lease is thirty-nine months, unless extended or earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the Foster City Lease. We have the option to extend the Foster City Lease for one additional period of one year. As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any other operating lease obligations, long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business for contract research services, contract manufacturing services, professional services and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination after a notice period, and, therefore, are cancelable contracts and not included above. Cash Flows Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited) The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (unaudited) Net cash used in operating activities (60,149) (41,978) Net cash provided by investing activities 42,900 6,228 Net cash provided by financing activities 24,873 45,533 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 7,624 9,783 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 60.1 million, consisting primarily of our net loss incurred during the period of 64.2 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 10.1 million for stock-based compensation expense, 1.9 million of accretion on investments, 0.3 million of depreciation expense, and 4.4 million for net changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to a 0.1 million increase in prepaid expenses, a 0.8 million decrease in other assets, a 5.6 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities, and a 0.5 million decrease in other liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 42.0 million, consisting primarily of our net loss incurred during the period of 55.1 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 8.7 million for stock-based compensation expense, 2.1 million of accretion on investments, and 6.5 million for net changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to a 6.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities, a 0.1 million decrease in other assets, a 0.1 million decrease in other liabilities and a 0.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses.

 Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 42.9 million was comprised of purchases of short-term investments of 19.7 million, offset by maturities of short-term investments of 62.6 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 6.2 million was comprised of purchases of short-term investments of 96.2 million, 0.1 million for purchases of property and equipment, offset by maturities of short-term investments of 102.5 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 24.9 million was comprised of 23.6 million in net proceeds received from sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement, after deducting Agent commissions, 0.3 million of payments made for offering costs, and 1.5 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 45.5 million was comprised of 44.9 million in net proceeds received from sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement, after deducting Agent commissions, 0.2 million of payments made for offering costs, and 0.8 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Research and Development Expenses We are required to estimate our expenses resulting from obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants and CROs, in connection with conducting research and development activities. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. We reflect research and development expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the preclinical or clinical study as measured by the timing of various aspects of the study or related activities. We determine clinical trial cost estimates through review of the underlying contracts along with preparation of financial models taking into account discussions with research and other key personnel and outsider service providers as to the progress of studies or other services being conducted. During the course of a study, we adjust our rate of expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. Emerging Growth Company Status As an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a 

 30 

Table of Contents 
 standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard. The decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other standard-setting bodies and have determined that such standards that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, if adopted, or do not otherwise apply to our operations. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk We hold certain financial instruments for which a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the cash equivalents to fluctuate. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to ensure liquidity and to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. We do not believe interest rate fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Foreign Currency Fluctuation Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with vendors that are located outside the United States and certain invoices are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with such arrangements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. We do not believe exchange rate fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Inflation Fluctuation Risk Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research and development contract costs. We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates continue to rise) due to an impact on the costs to conduct clinical trials, labor costs we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, and other operational costs. Inflationary costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosures controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management determined that, as of September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, as of September 30, 2024, we were not party to any legal proceedings that we would expect to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In evaluating the Company and our business, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other documents that we file with the SEC. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks facing the Company. New risk factors can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any factor or combination of factors may have on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. The risk factors denoted with a " ", if any, are newly added or have been materially updated from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks Related to the Merger We may not be successful in consummating the Merger. In June 2024, based upon 24-week topline results from the Phase 2b portion of our clinical trial evaluating AV-101 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, we announced our decision to halt enrollment and shut down the Phase 3 portion of the trial as well as the long-term extension study. In July 2024, we announced that we were undertaking a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value, which may include but are not limited to, the Merger or an alternative transaction or liquidation. We have and expect to continue to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives that our board of directors believes will maximize stockholder value. There can be no assurances that the Merger will be successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value or that we will make any additional cash distributions to our stockholders. The process of completing the Merger may be very costly, time-consuming and complex and we have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant costs related to the Merger, including legal and accounting fees and expenses and other related charges. We may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with the Merger, which will be incurred regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These expenses will decrease the remaining cash available for use in our business. 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 We are not currently pursuing further clinical development of AV-101. Resuming the development of AV-101 and any potential commercialization would require substantial additional cash to fund the costs associated with conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval. Consequently, if the Merger is completed, Jade may choose not to spend additional resources to continue development of AV-101 and may attribute little or no value in the Merger to AV-101. The Merger could have a variety of negative consequences, or yield unexpected results that adversely affects our business and decreases the remaining cash available for use in our business or the execution of our strategic plan. The completion of the Merger is dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends and obtaining stockholder approval. Any failure of the Merger could significantly impair our ability to enter into any future strategic transactions and may significantly diminish or delay any future distributions to our stockholders. If the Merger is not completed in a timely fashion, this may cause reputational harm with our stockholders and the value of our securities may be adversely impacted. In addition, speculation regarding the completion of the Merger and perceived uncertainties related to our future could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. If we are successful in completing the Merger, we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks. Although there can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed, the negotiation and consummation of the Merger will require significant time on the part of our management, and the diversion of management s attention may disrupt our business. The negotiation and consummation of the Merger may also require more time or greater cash resources than we anticipate and expose us to other operational and financial risks, including: increased near-term and long-term expenditures; exposure to unknown liabilities; higher than expected acquisition or integration costs; incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund future operations; write-downs of assets or goodwill or incurrence of non-recurring, impairment or other charges; increased amortization expenses; inability to retain key employees to complete the Merger; and possibility of future litigation. 
 Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. If the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities. If the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 such obligations and the timing of any such resolution is uncertain. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Failure to complete the merger may result in either Jade or us paying a termination fee to the other party, and could harm our common stock price and future business and operations of each company. If the Merger is not completed, we and Jade are subject to the following risks: if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we could be required to pay Jade a termination fee of 2.34 million, or Jade could be required to pay us a termination fee of 5.25 million; the price of our common stock may decline and could fluctuate significantly; and substantial costs related to the Merger may be incurred by either party, such as financial advisor, legal and accounting fees, a majority of which must be paid even if the Merger is not completed. 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of Jade or us determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that either we or Jade will be able to find another third party to transact a business combination with, yielding comparable or greater benefits. Some of Jade s and our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from yours. Our directors and executive officers and those of Jade may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our other stockholders generally. These interests with respect to our directors and executive officers may include, among others, acceleration of stock option or restricted stock unit vesting, retention bonus payments, extension of exercisability periods of previously issued stock option grants, severance payments if employment is terminated in a qualifying termination in connection with the Merger and rights to continued indemnification, expense advancement and insurance coverage. These interests with respect to Jade s directors and executive officers may include, among others, certain of Jade s directors and executive officers have options, subject to vesting, to purchase shares of Jade common stock which, after the effective time of the Merger, will be converted into and become options to purchase shares of the common stock of the combined company; Jade s executive officers are expected to continue as executive officers of the combined company after the effective time of the Merger; and all of Jade s directors and executive officers are entitled to certain indemnification and liability insurance coverage pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, certain of our directors and Jade s directors are affiliated with investment funds which hold an interest in the other party, and are participating in the Concurrent Investment. Further, current members of Jade s board of directors will continue as directors of the combined company after the effective time of the Merger, and, following the closing of the Merger, will be eligible to be compensated as non-employee directors of the combined company pursuant to our non-employee director compensation policy that is expected to remain in place following the effective time of the Merger. The directors and executive officers own options and/or, with respect to us, RSUs, to purchase the shares of their respective companies. Our board and the Jade board considered the interests in the Merger that the respective directors and officers may have that are different than yours, among other matters, in reaching their decisions to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, approve the Merger, and recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement to our stockholders and Jade stockholders. Our stockholders and Jade stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger, including the conversion of Jade common stock issued in the Concurrent Investment. If the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, our stockholders and Jade stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger. Our securityholders and Jade securityholders will generally have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management of, the combined company following the completion of the Merger as compared to their current ownership and voting interests in the respective companies. After the completion of the Merger, our current stockholders and the current stockholders of Jade will generally own a smaller percentage of the combined company than their ownership of their respective companies prior to the Merger. Immediately after the Merger, our stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger are expected to own approximately 1.6 of the outstanding shares of the combined company, former Jade securityholders, excluding shares purchased in the Concurrent Investment, are expected to own approximately 34.0 of the outstanding shares of the combined company and shares issued in the Concurrent Investment are expected to represent approximately 64.4 of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the combined company, subject to certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, our net cash as of closing being 0. The Chief Executive Officer of Jade will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company following the completion of the Merger. During the pendency of the Merger, we and Jade may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party on more favorable terms because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective business prospects. Covenants in the Merger Agreement impede our ability and Jade s ability to make acquisitions during the pendency of the Merger, subject to specified exceptions. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, seeking, initiating or knowingly encouraging, inducing or facilitating the communication, making, submission or announcement of any acquisition proposal or acquisition inquiry or taking any action that could reasonably be expected to lead to certain transactions involving a third party, including a merger, sale of assets or other business combination, subject to specified exceptions. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party s stockholders, but the parties may be unable to pursue them. Certain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of us and Jade from soliciting competing proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances. In addition, if we terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we could be required to pay Jade a termination fee of 2.34 million, or Jade could be required to pay us a termination fee of 5.25 million. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals to us, Jade or their respective stockholders, and may cause the our or Jade s board of directors to be less inclined to recommend a competing proposal. Our ability to consummate the Merger depends on our ability to retain the employees required to consummate such transaction. Our ability to consummate the Merger depends upon our ability to retain the employees required to consummate such a transaction, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the ability to consummate such transaction. In connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives and in order to extend resources, we implemented workforce reduction plan, which resulted in the termination of nearly all of our workforce, or the Workforce Reduction Plan. Under the Workforce Reduction Plan, approximately 90 of our workforce was terminated as of September 30, 2024. The Merger process is supported by our deep and broad experience at the board of directors, executive management and supporting staff levels. Our cash conservation activities may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our Workforce Reduction Plan and reduced employee morale, which may cause remaining employees to seek alternative employment. Our ability to successfully complete the Merger depends in large part on our ability to retain certain of our remaining personnel. If we 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 are unable to successfully retain our remaining personnel, we are at risk of a disruption to the Merger process as well as business operations. Our cash preservation activities, including the Workforce Reduction Plan, may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business. In June 2024, we implemented our Workforce Reduction Plan. In connection with the Workforce Reduction Plan, we incurred costs of approximately 6.4 million, which are primarily one-time severance benefits. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the restructuring, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Furthermore, our Workforce Reduction Plan may be disruptive to our operations. For example, headcount reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as increased difficulties in implementing our business strategy, including retention of remaining employees. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, risks that we may not be able to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. For example, our limited resources and workforce reduction may negatively impact efforts to winddown our clinical trial activities or expose us to cybersecurity risks, which could result in unexpected costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. We may become involved in litigation, including securities class action litigation, that could divert management s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. In the past, litigation, including securities class action litigation, has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as a Merger, or the announcement of negative events, such as negative results from clinical trials. These events may also result in investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We may be exposed to such litigation in connection with the Merger even if no wrongdoing occurred. Furthermore, the stock market in general, and Nasdaq and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. The market price of our common stock may be volatile, and we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is usually expensive and diverts management s attention and resources from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate the Merger or the ultimate value our stockholders receive in any such transaction. Risks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Requirements We are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We are a biopharmaceutical company established in July 2018 with a limited operating history. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, research and development of AV-101, our only product candidate, business planning, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. In June 2024, we announced our decision to halt enrollment and shut down the Phase 3 portion of our Inhaled iMatinib Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Clinical Trial (IMPAHCT) clinical trial for AV-101 in adults with PAH as well as the long-term extension study. We do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or conduct research on additional product candidates at this time. We have no products approved for commercial sale and therefore have never generated any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to in the foreseeable future. We have no other 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 experience as a company conducting clinical trials, submitting applications for regulatory approvals, such as a New Drug Application, or NDA, or commercializing any products. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have incurred significant operating losses in each year since our incorporation in July 2018, do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability. Our net losses were 64.2 million and 55.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 227.6 million. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in July 2018. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development program of AV-101 and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or conduct research on additional product candidates at this time. As a public company, we continue to incur additional costs associated with operating that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, we expect to continue to incur costs and expenditures in connection with the process of winding down our clinical trial of AV-101 and the Merger. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the Merger, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders deficit and working capital. The amount of our future losses is uncertain and our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following: the timing and outcome of the Merger; 
 the experience of any delays or any issues with winding down our clinical trial activities for AV-101; our ability to retain necessary personnel; potential litigation, including securities class action litigation; the changing and volatile United States and global economic conditions; and future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies. 
 The cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated revenue, and we do not expect to generate any revenue in the near future. We do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or conduct research on additional product candidates at this time.

Table of Contents 
 We may require additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts. Since our inception, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of AV-101 to address the core disease processes of PAH. We do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or conduct research on additional product candidates at this time. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 88.7 million. We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q based upon our current operating plans. However, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To date, we have funded our operations through private placements of convertible preferred stock, convertible notes and proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and currently intend to do so through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, is likely to involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities received any distribution of our corporate assets. Additionally, global economic instability, higher interest rates and diminished credit availability may limit our ability to obtain debt financing on favorable terms. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize such product candidates. Disruptions in the financial markets in general, and due to public health crises, geopolitical conflicts and economic instability, may make equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our fundraising needs. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Risks Related to the Research and Development Activities The results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired pharmacological properties or safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. For example, in June 2024, we announced the discontinuation of our Phase 3 portion of IMPAHCT as well as the long-term extension study, despite prior positive results in preclinical studies and initial clinical trials of AV-101. Interim, topline and preliminary results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. From time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These interim updates are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies or trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, we may report interim analyses of only certain endpoints rather than all endpoints. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse changes between interim data and final data could significantly harm our business and prospects. Further, additional disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors in the future could result in volatility in the price of our common stock. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or trial is typically selected from a more extensive amount of available information. Investors may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or our business. If the preliminary or topline data that we report differ from late, final or actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Risks Related to Commercialization Our ability to generate revenue may be adversely affected if the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities approve generic versions of such product candidates, or do not grant a sufficient period of market exclusivity before approving its generic version. Once an NDA is approved, including under the 505(b)(2) pathway, the product covered thereby becomes a reference listed drug in the FDA s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, and may obtain therapeutical equivalence evaluations for 505(b)(2) pathway drugs under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act s expanded authorities, in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labelling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product. Generic drug manufacturers may seek to launch generic products following the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period we obtain if a product candidate is approved, even if we still have patent protection. Competition from generic versions could materially and adversely affect our future revenue, profitability, and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments into any product candidates. Successful commercialization of any product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payors provide coverage and adequate reimbursement levels. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any product candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market our product and decrease our ability to generate revenue. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to be able to afford medical services and pharmaceutical products that receive FDA approval. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our product candidates, could reduce physician utilization if approved. Assuming there is coverage for our product candidates by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union, or EU, or elsewhere will be available and any reimbursement that may become available may not be adequate or may be decreased or eliminated in the future. For more information, see Business Government Regulation Pricing and Reimbursement in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and other third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs have resulted in increasing challenges to prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent generic drug, biosimilar or a less expensive therapy is available. Even if a product shows improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration, pricing of existing third-party therapeutics may limit the amount able to be charged for it. These third-party payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of our product candidates, if approved, or establish prices for it at levels that are too low to enable realizing an appropriate return on investment, which would inhibit successful commercialization of product candidates. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Reimbursement may not be available for any product candidate that is commercialized and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs. Outside the United States, pharmaceutical products are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries will likely put pressure on the pricing and usage of medical products. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that can be charged for product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially-reasonable revenue and profits. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We have six issued U.S. patents, and many pending patent applications with respect to AV-101. We can provide no assurance that any of our other current or future patent applications will result in issued patents. If we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may develop products similar or identical to ours, and we may not be able to compete effectively in our market or successfully commercialize any product candidates we may develop. Our success has depended to a significant degree upon continuing to secure, enforce and defend intellectual property rights that protect our AV-101 product candidate, and to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others. If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property

Table of Contents 
 protection for AV-101, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors and other third parties could develop and commercialize product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize AV-101 may be impaired. In June 2024, we announced our decision to halt enrollment and shut down the Phase 3 portion of IMPAHCT as well as the long-term extension study of AV-101 in PAH and we do not intend to continue to seek or maintain intellectual property protection on the technology underlying AV-101. We own six issued U.S. patents with respect to AV-101, and we can provide no assurance that any of our other current or future patent applications will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantage. Failure to obtain additional issued patents could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge, invalidate or circumvent our issued patents so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our proprietary technologies, development programs and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications or to maintain, defend and enforce any patents that may issue from such patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal, technological and factual questions and has, in recent years, been the subject of much debate and litigation throughout the world. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. The subject matter claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Therefore, our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued in relevant jurisdictions that protect our product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive product candidates, and even if our patent applications issue as patents in relevant jurisdictions, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection for our product candidates or technology, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Additionally, our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative product candidates or technologies in a non-infringing manner. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our current or future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others, or other proceedings in the USPTO or applicable foreign offices that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate, patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, limit the scope or duration of the patent protection of AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify, all of which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates or technology to compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize product candidates or approved products (if any) without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates, or could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise funds necessary to 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 continue our research programs or clinical trials. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. We cannot be certain that the USPTO and courts in the United States or the patent offices and courts in foreign countries will consider the claims in our patents and applications covering our AV-101 product candidate and possible future product candidates as patentable. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent, including through legal action. Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and prevent us from pursuing our programs. From time to time we may have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may need to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the USPTO or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States and in Europe, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Third parties might allege unenforceability of our patents because during prosecution of the patent an individual connected with such prosecution withheld relevant information or made a misleading statement. The outcome of proceedings involving assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution, but that an adverse third party may identify and submit in support of such assertions of invalidity. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidate. Our patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our issued patent, any patents that may be issued as a result of our pending or future patent applications or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.

 Third parties may initiate or threaten legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our strategic partners to develop, manufacture, market and sell our drugs and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. Extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may in the future become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our drugs and technology, including interference, derivation, reexamination, post-grant review, opposition, cancellation or similar proceedings before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, resulting in payment of damages. These damages potentially include increased damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have infringed such rights willfully. Parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our drugs and their uses. If a third party claims that our AV-101 product candidate, any other product candidates that we may identify, or our technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we or our partners may have to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We could be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to continue developing and commercializing AV-101 or other product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on reasonable terms, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights. We might also be forced to redesign or modify our product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which redesign or modification could be impossible or technically infeasible. There are many patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the United States are filed confidentially for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain. Thus, we do not know with certainty that our drugs or our intended commercialization thereof, does and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party s intellectual property. If we do not obtain additional protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation cannot be obtained to extend the patent protection for a product candidate, business operations may be materially harmed. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the first FDA marketing authorization of a product candidate, a United States patent may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments allow the owner of an approved product to extend patent protection for up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. During this period of extension, the scope of protection is limited to the approved product and approved uses. Patent term restoration for products may not succeed if, for example, there is a failure to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested. Failure to obtain patent term restoration, or if the term of any such patent restoration is less than requested, competitors may enter the market and compete sooner than anticipated, and the ability to generate revenue could be materially adversely affected.

 We may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent which might adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture and market our product candidate. We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including but not limited to the identification of relevant patents, analysis of the scope of relevant patent claims or determination of the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States, Europe and elsewhere that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify in any jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States, EU and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidates could be filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify or the use of AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify. After issuance, the scope of patent claims remains subject to construction as determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our product candidates. We may incorrectly determine that AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify is not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States, the EU or elsewhere that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify. If we fail to correctly identify or interpret relevant patents, we may be subject to infringement claims. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay monetary damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign AV-101 or any other product candidates that we may identify in a manner that no longer infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business. Changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing the ability to protect product candidates. Recent court rulings, including rules from the United States Supreme Court, have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that might be obtained in the future. In addition, the America Invents Act, or the AIA, which was passed in September 2011, resulted in significant changes to the U.S. patent system. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. Among some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. It is not clear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. However, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We may become involved in opposition, interference, derivation, inter partes review or other proceedings challenging our patent rights, and the outcome of any proceedings are highly uncertain. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. There may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns. Further, a new court system recently became operational in the European Union. The Unified Patent Court, or UPC, began accepting patent cases on June 1, 2023. The UPC is a common patent court with jurisdiction over patent infringement and revocation proceedings effective for multiple member states of the European Union. The broad geographic reach of the UPC could enable third parties to seek revocation of any of our European patents in a single proceeding at the UPC rather than through multiple proceedings in each of the individual European Union member states in which the European patent is validated. Under the UPC, a successful revocation proceeding for a European Patent under the UPC would result in loss of patent protection in those European Union countries. Accordingly, a single proceeding under the UPC could result in the partial or complete loss of patent protection in numerous European Union countries. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize our technology and product candidates and, resultantly, on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Moreover, the controlling laws and regulations of the UPC will develop over time and we cannot predict what the outcomes of cases tried before the UPC will be. The case law of the UPC may adversely affect our ability to enforce or defend the validity of our European patents. Patent owners have the option to opt-out their European Patents from the jurisdiction of the UPC, defaulting to pre-UPC enforcement mechanisms. We have decided to opt out certain European patents and patent applications from the UPC. However, if certain formalities and requirements are not met, our European patents and patent applications could be subject to the jurisdiction of the UPC. We cannot be certain that our European patents and patent applications will avoid falling under the jurisdiction of the UPC, if we decide to opt out of the UPC. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. The USPTO and European and other patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and European and other patent agencies over the lifetime of a patent. While an inadvertent failure to make payment of such fees or to comply with such provisions can in many cases be cured by additional payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance with such provisions will result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, and the partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents within prescribed time limits. In June 2024, we announced our decision to halt enrollment and shut down the Phase 3 portion of IMPAHCT as well as the long-term extension study of AV-101 in PAH and we do not intend to continue to seek or maintain intellectual property

 protection on the technology underlying AV-101. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering AV-101 or if we otherwise allow our patents or patent applications to be abandoned or lapse, it will result in partial or complete loss of patent rights. We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. These agreements generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, those agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Moreover, there may be some circumstances, where we are unable to negotiate for such ownership rights. Disputes regarding ownership or inventorship of intellectual property can also arise in other contexts, such as collaborations and sponsored research. If we are subject to a dispute challenging our rights in or to patents or other intellectual property, such a dispute could be expensive and time consuming. If we were unsuccessful, we could lose valuable rights in intellectual property that we regard as our own. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. We could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other confidential information of former employers or competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may become subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer or competitor. While we may litigate to defend ourselves against these claims, even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defenses to these claims fail, in addition to requiring us to pay monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our product candidates, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to form strategic alliances or sublicense our rights to collaborators, engage with scientific advisors or hire employees or consultants, each of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. We rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information and to maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our product candidates that we consider proprietary. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information will be effective. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed. If we and our partners do not adequately protect the trademarks and trade names for our products, then we and our partners may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. Our competitors or other third parties may challenge, infringe or circumvent the trademarks or trade names for our products. We and our partners may not be able to protect these trademarks and trade names. In addition, if the trademarks or trade names for one of our products infringe the rights of others, we or our partners may be forced to stop using the trademarks or trade names, which we need for name recognition in our markets of interest. If we cannot establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we and our partners may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Government Regulation We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization of any product candidates and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations. We have not previously submitted an NDA or any other marketing application to the FDA or similar filings to comparable foreign regulatory authorities. An NDA or other similar regulatory filing requesting approval to market a product candidate must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, effective, pure and potent for each desired indication. The NDA or other similar regulatory filing must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. Product candidates cannot be marketed in the United States or in any foreign countries until receiving the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities of such jurisdictions. The FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons, including: the inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that a product candidate is safe and effective for the requested indication; the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s disagreement with trial protocol or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; the inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of a product candidate outweigh any safety or other perceived risks; the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or specifications for a product candidate; 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s failure to approve our manufacturing processes and facilities or the facilities of third-party manufacturers relied upon; or the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. 
 Of the large number of pharmaceutical products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory bodies approval processes and are commercialized. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval from the FDA or applicable foreign agencies for any product candidates, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials which may be required after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than originally requested, and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not approve it with the labeling that is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization. Should we in the future conduct clinical trials outside the United States, and the FDA, EMA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials. The acceptance of trial data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States by the FDA, EMA, or applicable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Additionally, the FDA s clinical trial requirements, including sufficient size of patient populations and statistical powering, must be met. Many foreign regulatory bodies have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials will be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA, EMA, or any applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA, EMA, or any applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay the business plan, and which may result in a product candidate not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, which may result in significant additional expenses. If approved, our product candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with any product candidates. We do not intend to resume development of AV-101 or commence development of any other product candidates. However, if we were to have a product candidate approved by the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, it will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration and listing, as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses, including the duration of use, for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. The FDA may also require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS in order to approve a product 

 48 

Table of Contents 
 candidate, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Manufacturers and manufacturers facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current GMP regulations and implementing tracking and tracing requirements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with current GMP and adherence to commitments made in any approved marketing application. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. In the event any future product candidates are approved, we would have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product s approved label. As such, we may not promote a product candidate for indications or uses for which it does not have approval. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product s FDA approved labeling. We also must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to product labeling, or manufacturing process. If we discover previously unknown problems with any product candidate, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where a product candidate is manufactured, or if the FDA disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling, the FDA may impose restrictions on it or us, including requiring withdrawal of it from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may, among other things: issue warning letters or other regulatory enforcement action; impose injunctions, fines or civil or criminal penalties; suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; suspend any clinical studies; refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; require revisions to the labeling, including limitations on approved uses or the addition of additional warnings, contraindications or other safety information, including boxed warnings; impose a REMS which may include distribution or use restrictions; require the conduct of an additional post-market clinical trial or trials to assess the safety of the product; impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers facilities where regulatory inspections identify observations of noncompliance requiring remediation; or restrict the marketing of the product, require a product recall, seizure or detention, or refuse to permit the import or export of the product. 
 Any government action or investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected.

 Moreover, the policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of any product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. In addition, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA for AV-101 for treatment of PAH, but we may be unable to obtain additional designations or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including the potential for non-patent market exclusivity. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or biologic as an orphan drug if it is a product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population of 200,000 or more in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the product will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Similarly, in the European Union, the European Commission, upon the recommendation of the EMA s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, may grant orphan designation in respect of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and either (i) such condition affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made or (ii) without incentives, it is unlikely that the marketing of the product would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the necessary investment in its development, and, in each case, for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In the European Union, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same product and indication for that time period, except in limited circumstances. Any competitor developing imatinib in the same indication with orphan drug designation may block our ability to obtain orphan drug exclusivity in the future if the competitor receives marketing approval before we do. The applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The European Union exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Legislation has been proposed by the European Commission that, if implemented, has the potential in some cases to shorten the ten-year period of orphan drug exclusivity. We previously obtained orphan drug designation for AV-101 in the United States from the FDA, and in the European Union from the EMA, for the treatment of PAH. Even with orphan drug exclusivity, that exclusivity may not effectively protect a product from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve the same product for the same condition if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition or if another product with the same active moiety is determined to be safer, more effective, or represents a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a product nor gives the product any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.

 Even if FDA approval is obtained in the United States, it does not guarantee approval for or successful commercialization of a product candidate outside of the United States, which would limit the ability to realize its full market potential. Marketing product candidates outside of the United States requires obtaining marketing authorizations and complying with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by foreign regulatory authorities, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of a product candidate in those countries. We, as a company, do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. Failing to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, the target market will be reduced and the full market potential of such product candidate could not be realized. Our business operations and relationships with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers have been subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties. Our business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal False Claims Act and Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute product candidates, if approved. For more information, see Business - Government Regulation - Healthcare Laws and Regulation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Ensuring that any internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involves substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws that may apply, it may result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom business is done are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment, which could affect the ability to operate its business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Healthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell a product for which regulatory approval is obtained. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact manufacturing arrangements, require additions or modifications to product labeling, result in the recall or discontinuation of products or result in additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. For more information, see Business - Government Regulation - Pricing and Reimbursement in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. Healthcare is a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact business, operations and financial condition. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future, including repeal, replacement or significant revisions to the ACA. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect future profitability. The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, if approved. In particular, while the FDA permits the dissemination of truthful and non-misleading information about an approved product, a manufacturer may not promote a product for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product s approved labeling. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The government has also imposed consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct must be changed or curtailed. Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government-shutdowns, or other disruptions to these agencies operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business. The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect business operations of regulated entities. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies. For example, over the last several years the United States government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. Further, future government shutdowns could impact the ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. Risks Related to Employee Matters Our insurance policies may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks. We have limited director and officer insurance and product liability insurance policies. Any significant insurance claims would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance availability, coverage terms, including deductibles and pricing, continue to vary with market conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify; however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage, and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur. We have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating 

 52 

Table of Contents 
 to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles and lower coverage limits. For some risks, we may not have or maintain insurance coverage because of cost or availability. We may be unable to adequately protect our information systems and infrastructure from cyberattacks and other cybersecurity incidents, which could result in the disclosure or compromise of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, damage to our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure. We rely on information technology systems that we or our third-party providers operate to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. In connection with our product discovery efforts, we may collect and use a variety of personal data, such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and clinical trial information. A successful cyberattack or other cybersecurity incident could result in the theft or destruction of this personal data, intellectual property, other data, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, level of persistence and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, wire fraud and other forms of cyber fraud, the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, ransomware, social engineering fraud or other means to threaten data security, confidentiality, integrity and availability. We may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience cybersecurity incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period. A successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including, without limitation, the disruption of operations, the misappropriation of confidential business information, including financial information, trade secrets, financial loss and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans. Although we devote resources to protect our information systems, we realize that cybersecurity incidents are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cybersecurity incidents that would result in business, legal, financial or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We maintain cybersecurity insurance in the event of a cybersecurity incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses. Any failure to prevent or mitigate cybersecurity incidents or improper access to, use of, or disclosure or compromise of our clinical data or patients personal data could result in significant liability under state (e.g., state breach notification laws), federal, and international law and may cause a material adverse impact to our reputation, affect our ability to conduct new studies and potentially disrupt our business. We rely on our third-party providers to implement effective security measures and identify and correct for any such failures, deficiencies or breaches. If we or our third-party providers fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to our information technology systems, we or our third-party providers could have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling such cyber-attacks and any such incidents could result in the losses described above as well as disputes with physicians, patients and our partners, regulatory sanctions or penalties, increases in operating expenses, other expenses or lost revenues or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows. Any failure by such third parties to prevent or mitigate cybersecurity incidents or improper access to or disclosure or compromise of such information could have similarly adverse consequences for us. If we are unable to prevent or mitigate the impact of such cybersecurity incidents, we could be exposed to litigation and governmental investigations, which could lead to a potential disruption to our business. By way of example, the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CCPA, provides a private right of action for data breaches impacting California residents.

 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in the ownership of its equity over a three year period), the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may have experienced such ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately 64.8 million and are accruing additional net operating losses in calendar year 2024, which will be added to the net operating loss carryover balance once the current year is completed. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by an ownership change as described above, which could result in increased tax liability to us. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs or credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating United States federal and state taxable income. As a result, the amount of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards presented in our financial statements could be limited and may expire unutilized. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated since our incorporation in July 2018 will not be subject to expiration. However, any such net operating loss carryforwards may only offset 80 of our annual taxable income. Changes in tax law may adversely affect us or our investors. The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, under Section 174 of the code, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development in the U.S. are capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our or our shareholders tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include: a board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board of directors will be elected at one time; a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; a requirement that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, and special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any other person or persons; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors; 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 a requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors; a requirement of approval of not less than a majority of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action and not less than two-thirds (2/3) of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend specific provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval, which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. 
 In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our amended and restated bylaws designate certain courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claim for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, and employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (including the interpretation, validity or enforceability thereof) or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein, or the Delaware Forum Provision. The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the Federal Forum Provision. In addition, our bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We recognize that the Delaware Forum Provision in our amended and restated bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware. Additionally, the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court were facially valid under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering 

 55 

Table of Contents 
 an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders. General Risk Factors Unfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A global financial crisis or a global or regional political disruption could cause extreme volatility in the capital markets and lead to diminished liquidity and credit availability, higher interest rates, declines in consumer confidence and economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of considerable uncertainty and volatility and interest rates in the U.S. have recently increased to levels not seen in decades. In addition, the impact of geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the United States and China or the ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions, also could lead to disruption, instability, and volatility in the global markets, as well as disruptions to our business. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to our business, our strategic prospects and our ability to raise additional capital as needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect the Company s current and projected business operations and its financial condition and results of operations. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership; since then, additional financial institutions have experienced similar failures and have been placed into receivership. It is possible that other banks will face similar difficulty in the future. We had no exposure to the SVB closure and did not experience any adverse impact to our liquidity or to our current and projected business operations, financial condition or results of operations. However, uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and there may be additional impacts to our business and our industry that we cannot predict at this time. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-2010 financial crisis. Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the Company, the financial institutions with which the Company has credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which the Company has financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. The results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following: Delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets; 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 Delayed or lost access to, or reductions in borrowings available under revolving existing credit facilities or other working capital sources and/or delays, inability or reductions in the company s ability to refund, roll over or extend the maturity of, or enter into new credit facilities or other working capital resources; Potential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require the Company to maintain letters of credit or other credit support arrangements; or Termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. 
 Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry could lead to losses or defaults by our suppliers, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. For example, a supplier may determine that it will no longer deal with us as a customer or a supplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity or other risks that are described above as factors that could result in material adverse impacts on the Company, including but not limited to delayed access or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. Any supplier bankruptcy or insolvency, or the failure of any customer to make payments when due, or any breach or default by a supplier, or the loss of any significant supplier relationships, could result in material losses to the Company and may have a material adverse impact on our business. Our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation, interest rates and supply chain constraints. Various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties such as those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, recent supply chain constraints have led to higher inflation, which if sustained could have a negative impact on our development of future product candidates, as well as our business and results of operations. If inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, our ability to develop our current pipeline and new therapeutic products may be negatively affected. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the operation of our business and our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, in order to fund our operations. Our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, any future commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; United States federal and state fraud and abuse laws, data privacy and security laws and other similar non-United States laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter 

 57 

Table of Contents 
 misconduct by employees and other third-parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other United States federal healthcare programs or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Actual or perceived failures to comply with United States and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. We are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal information, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or any service providers , contractors or future collaborators ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer, use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. As our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the United States, HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. For example, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Following the amendment of the CCPA by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, the CCPA is implemented and enforced by a new California data protection agency, which may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The effects of the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations and we also anticipate that more states will increasingly enact legislation similar to the CCPA. Already, laws similar to the CCPA have been passed in numerous other states. While these laws incorporate many similar concepts of the CCPA, there are also several key differences in the scope, application, and enforcement of the laws that will change the operational practices of regulated entities. In addition, Washington state recently passed a comprehensive health information privacy law. Proposed and newly enacted legislation may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.

 Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CROs, and contractors must comply. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (with regards to the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the UK GDPR (with regards to the UK), as well as applicable national data protection legislation and requirements. In this document, GDPR refers to both EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, unless specified otherwise. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal information, including requirements relating to having a legal basis for processing personal data, stricter requirements relating to the processing of sensitive data (such as health sensitive data), where required by GDPR obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments for high risk processing and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may result in warning letters, mandatory audits, orders to cease/change the use of data, and financial penalties, including fines of up to 4 of global revenues, or 20,000,000 Euro 17.5 million for the UK), whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. The GDPR provides that EEA Member States may make their own further laws and regulations in relation to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could result in differences between Member States, limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. The GDPR also includes restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal data to countries outside the EEA and UK that are not considered by the European Commission or UK Government as providing adequate protection to personal data, including the United States, unless a valid GDPR mechanism (for example, the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement/Addendum, or UK IDTA) has been put in place. Where relying on the SCCs or UK IDTA for data transfers, we may also be required to carry out transfer impact assessments to assess whether the recipient is subject to local laws which allow public authority access to personal data. Further, the EU and United States have adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, or the Framework, which entered into force on July 11, 2023. This Framework provides that the protection of personal data transferred between the EU and the United States is comparable to that offered in the EEA. This provides a further avenue to ensuring transfers to the United States are carried out in line with GDPR. There has been an extension to the Framework to cover UK transfers to the United States. The Framework could be challenged like its predecessor frameworks. The international transfer obligations under the EEA and UK data protection regimes will require significant effort and cost, and may result in us needing to make strategic considerations around where EEA and UK personal data is transferred and which service providers we can utilize for the processing of EEA and UK personal data. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU GDPR, the European Commission has issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR, or Adequacy Decision, and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EEA to the UK remain unrestricted. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. The UK Government has also now introduced a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, UK Bill, into the UK legislative process. The aim of the UK Bill is to reform the UK s data protection regime following Brexit. If passed, the final version of the UK Bill will have the effect of further altering the similarities between the UK and EEA data protection regime and threaten the UK Adequacy Decision from the European Commission. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. The respective provisions and enforcement of the EU GDPR and UK GDPR may further diverge in the future and create additional regulatory challenges and uncertainties. In addition, many jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or enacting comprehensive data protection legislation. For example, as of August 2020, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law imposes stringent requirements similar to GDPR with respect to personal information collected from individuals in Brazil. In China, there have also been recent significant developments concerning privacy and data security. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People s Congress published the Data Security Law of the People s Republic of China, or the Data Security Law, which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law requires data 

 59 

Table of Contents 
 processing (which includes the collection, storage, use, processing, transmission, provision and publication of data), to be conducted in a legitimate and proper manner. The Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data processing activities and also introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development and the degree of harm it may cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations if such data are tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or illegally used. The appropriate level of protection measures is required to be taken for each respective category of data. Also in China, on August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress of the PRC promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law, or PIPL, which took effect on November 1, 2021. PIPL raises the protection requirements for processing personal information, and many specific requirements of the PIPL remain to be clarified. Fines for PIPL violations range from 7.7 million to up to 5 of the infringing company s previous year s revenues. We may be required to make further significant adjustments to our business practices to comply with the personal information protection laws and regulations in China. Although we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws (including the GDPR), commercial frameworks, and standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, frameworks, and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices and policies. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, breach of contract claims, and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and security or data security laws, regulations, and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our ability to conduct trials, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and a smaller reporting company as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of June 30th. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404; not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; providing only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements and a correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure; the requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure regarding executive compensation; and 

 60 

Table of Contents 
 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and some of the disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of executive officers. 
 Although we are still evaluating the JOBS Act, we currently intend to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions available to us so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q. In particular, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard. As a result, changes in rules of United States generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may not pay any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, and capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We may retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. We incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on 

 61 

Table of Contents 
 public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Pursuant to Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Management s initial certification under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was provided with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we have engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we have been and will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we are not able to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq. If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with our IPO, we began the process of documenting, reviewing and improving our internal controls and procedures for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes, and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and harm our business. In addition, investors perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price. Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that existing analysts will continue to provide research coverage or that new analysts will begin to provide research coverage. Although we have obtained analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Use of Proceeds from our Public Offering of Common Stock As of September 30, 2024, we have used all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering, or the IPO, and there was no material change in our actual use of the net proceeds from the IPO from that described in the final prospectus for the IPO filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on June 30, 2021. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. (a) In connection with our previously announced workforce reduction plan, on August 6, 2024, our Chief Commercial Officer, Tim Pigot, was terminated without cause, effective August 15, 2024, or the Separation Date. Pursuant to Mr. Pigot s Employment Agreement with the Company, Mr. Pigot is entitled to receive severance equal to nine months of his base salary in effect on the Separation Date, in the total gross amount of 315,600, less applicable taxes and withholdings, payable in equal installments over a nine-month period, and reimbursement of COBRA premiums for healthcare insurance coverage for up to nine months to the extent Mr. Pigot is eligible for and elects COBRA coverage. The foregoing severance benefits are contingent upon Mr. Pigot s execution of a separation agreement, including a general release of claims and customary cooperation clause in order to ensure a smooth transition after Mr. Pigot s departure. Mr. Pigot s final separation agreement is filed as an exhibit on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and this disclosure is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the final agreement.
