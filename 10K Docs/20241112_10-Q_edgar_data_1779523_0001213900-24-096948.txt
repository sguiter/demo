All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

of its investment
company taxable income, which is generally its net ordinary taxable income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital
gains over its realized net long-term capital losses. 

In order for the Company not to be
subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income, it must distribute annually an amount at least
equal to the sum of (i) of its net ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) of its capital gains in excess of capital losses
for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income and net capital gains that it recognized
for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which the Company paid no U.S. federal income tax. The Company,
at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise
tax on this income. 

The Company evaluates tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions
are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not 
threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income
taxes are included in income tax expense. The Company s federal tax years 2021, 2022, and 2023 remain subject to examination by
the Internal Revenue Service and the State of Delaware. 

For the tax year ended December 31,
2022, the Company was unable to satisfy the requirement that a RIC must derive at least of its annual gross income from qualifying
income. As a result, the Company paid tax expenses on the income generated from the Company s ownership percentage in the
assets from which the nonqualifying income was derived during the tax year ended December 31, 2022 in the amount of , which included
 in penalties (the Section 851(i) Tax Liability ). The Adviser reimbursed the Company in full for payment of the Section
851(i) Tax Liability. 

In December 2023, the Company established
the Subsidiary to hold equity or equity-like investments in partnerships. All intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation, and
the Company is consolidated with the Subsidiary for accounting purposes, but the Subsidiary is not consolidated with the Company for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and may incur U.S. federal income tax expense as a result. 

The Company does not consider the Section
851(i) Tax Liability due on the income generated from the Company s ownership percentage in assets from which the nonqualifying
income was derived during the tax year ended December 31, 2022 to be an uncertain tax position. Conclusions regarding tax positions are
subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations
and interpretations thereof.

Gross unrealized appreciation on investments 

Gross unrealized depreciation on investments 

Total investments at fair value 

The difference between U.S. GAAP-basis
and tax basis unrealized gains (losses) is attributable primarily to differences in the tax treatment of partnership investments. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company did not reclassify any amounts, as any reclassifications are determined at year-end. 

The difference between the Company s
U.S. GAAP-basis total distributable earnings and its tax basis total distributable earnings as of December 31, 2023 was primarily due
to a reclassification of a non-deductible excise tax to additional paid-in capital.

(i.e.,
 annually) of the average of the Company s NAV (excluding uninvested cash and cash equivalents, which are defined for these
purposes as money market funds, U.S. government securities and investment grade debt instruments maturing within one year of purchase
of such instrument by the Company) at the end of the then-current calendar quarter and the Company s NAV at the end of the prior
calendar quarter (excluding uninvested cash and cash equivalents). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the
Company incurred Management Fees of , , , and , respectively. 

Incentive Fee 

Pursuant to the Investment Management
Agreement, the Company incurs an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee payable to the Adviser. The Incentive Fee will not be
released or paid to the Adviser until the liquidation of the Company s portfolio. However, the Incentive Fee will accrue throughout
the Company s life, and the Company may set aside assets in anticipation of paying it. However, the Company does not intend to actually
pay the Incentive Fee to the Adviser until the end of the life of the Company. 

In order to determine the size of the
Incentive Fee, the Company refers to the incentive fee calculation methodology described below (the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology ). 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Incentive
Fee Calculation Methodology is not intended to describe the Company s actual operations with respect to the making of distributions,
and the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology does not limit the Company s ability to make distributions to stockholders over the
life of the Company (other than the Company s actual payment of the Incentive Fee upon its liquidation). Rather, the Incentive Fee
Calculation Methodology is a tool, the sole purpose of which is to calculate the size of the Incentive Fee. 

To calculate the size of the Incentive
Fee, the Company will refer to (1) the amounts and timing of stockholders capital contributions to the Company and (2) the amounts
and timing of the Company s distributions, and will analyze those contributions and distributions under the Incentive Fee Calculation
Methodology. The Incentive Fee will equal the total amount of distributions that would be made to the Adviser under paragraphs (c) and
(d) of the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology.

affiliated with the Adviser held shares of the Company. Muzinich U.S. Private Debt SCSp held shares of the Company, or approximately
 of the outstanding shares of the Company, and Muzinich held shares of the Company, or approximately of the outstanding
shares of the Company. 

Co-Investment Exemptive Order 

On February 2, 2021, the SEC issued
an exemptive order (the Exemptive Order which permits the Company to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, the Company, we, us, and our 
refer to Muzinich BDC, Inc., and the Adviser refers to Muzinich BDC Adviser, LLC, an affiliate of Muzinich Co., Inc.
(together with the Adviser and their other affiliates, collectively, Muzinich ). 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements are not historical facts and are based on current expectations,
estimates, projections, opinions and/or beliefs of the Company and/or Muzinich. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking
terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, 
 estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives thereof, or other variations
thereon or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies,
prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that
it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, information in this Form 10-Q regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to
operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies.
In particular, there are forward-looking statements under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors
referenced under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as any cautionary language in this Form 10-Q, provide examples
of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking
statements. You should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us
in this Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date on which we make it. Factors or events that could cause actual results to differ may emerge
from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

The following factors are among those that may
cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 

our future operating results; 

changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, which could result in changes to the value of our assets, or other external factors, including the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our prospective portfolio companies, including our and their ability to achieve our respective objectives as a result of the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas; 

the impact of investments that we expect to make; 

the impact of increased competition; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 

the ability of our prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

the relative and absolute performance of our Adviser; 

the ability of our Adviser and its affiliates to attract and retain talented professionals; 

our expected financings and investments; 

our ability to pay dividends or make distributions; 

27 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; 

the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures; 

the timing and manner in which we conduct an initial public offering IPO and/or listing, if at all; 

the timing and manner in which we conduct any share repurchase offers; and 

our regulatory structure and tax status as a BDC and a regulated investment company (a RIC ). 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which
these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of
those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove
to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Form 10-Q
should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include
those referenced in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Form 10-Q and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We do not
undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required
by applicable law. 

Overview 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State
of Delaware on May 29, 2019. We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940
Act ), and have elected to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. As such, we are required to comply with various
regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income
limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt
interest. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have capital commitments
from investors in the amount of 205,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we have additional paid-in capital in the amount of 177,006,868.
See Equity Activity under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further details.
Management anticipates raising additional equity capital for investment purposes through drawdowns in respect of capital commitments made
by investors pursuant to private offerings of our common stock Private Offerings ). 

Revenues 

We generate revenue in the form of interest income
from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained
in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. We expect most of the debt securities we will hold
will be floating rate in nature. The debt we invest in will typically not be rated by any rating agency, but if it were, it is likely
that such debt would be below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Moody s and lower than BBB- by Fitch Ratings, Inc. Fitch or Standard Poor s Rating Group, a division
of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. S P )), which is an indication of having predominantly speculative characteristics
with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. We intend to structure our debt investments with interest
payable quarterly, semi-annually or annually, but we may structure certain investments with terms to provide for longer interest payment
periods or to allow interest to be paid by adding amounts due to the principal balance of the loan, resulting in deferred cash receipts.
In addition, we may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing
managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized
as additional interest income over the life of the related loan. 

28 

Expenses 

We anticipate that all investment professionals
and staff of our Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the base compensation,
bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the
Adviser and its affiliates. 

We will bear all other costs and expenses of its
operations, administration and transactions, including, without limitation, those described in Item 1. Business Fees and
Expenses in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

From time to time, our Adviser or its affiliates
may pay amounts owed by us to third-party providers of goods or services. We will subsequently reimburse our Adviser for such amounts
paid on our behalf. There is no contractual cap on the amount of reasonable costs and expenses for which our Adviser will be reimbursed. 

We have entered into a credit facility with BNP
Paribas Prime Brokerage International, Limited BNP and may enter into a further credit facility or other debt arrangements
to partially fund our operations. We have and will incur costs and expenses including commitment, origination, legal and/or structuring
fees and the related interest costs associated with any amounts borrowed. 

We have a limited operating history, and therefore
statements concerning additional expenses are necessarily estimates and may not match our actual results of operations in the future. 

Portfolio and Investment Activity 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 14 debt investments
totaling 137,017,256, and 15 equity investments totaling 11,592,417 across 10 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately
 148.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, our debt investments consisted entirely of senior secured loans. Short-term investments as of

The Adviser believes that actively managing an
investment allows it to identify problems early and work with companies to develop constructive solutions when necessary. The Adviser
monitors our portfolio with a focus toward anticipating negative credit events. In seeking to maintain portfolio company performance and
to help ensure a successful exit, the Adviser works closely with, as applicable, the lead equity sponsor, portfolio company management,
consultants, advisers and other security holders to discuss financial positions, compliance with covenants, financial requirements and
execution of the portfolio company s business plan. In addition, the Adviser s personnel may occupy a seat or serve as an
observer on a portfolio company s board of directors or similar governing body. 

Typically, we will receive financial reports detailing
operating performance, sales volumes, margins, cash flows, financial position and other key operating metrics on a quarterly basis from
portfolio companies. The Adviser uses this data, combined with knowledge gained through due diligence of the company s customers,
suppliers, competitors, market research and other methods, to conduct an ongoing assessment of the portfolio company s operating
performance and prospects.

Resources 

We generate and expect to continue to generate
cash from (1) future offerings of our common or preferred stock, (2) cash flows from operations and (3) borrowings from banks or other
lenders. We have entered into a committed facility agreement with BNP (the Loan Agreement ), and we may seek to enter into
any further bank debt, credit facility or other financing arrangements on market terms; however, we cannot assure you we will be able
to do so. Our primary uses of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio
diversification requirements, (ii) paying our operating expenses (including fees payable to the Adviser), (iii) debt service of any borrowings
and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our stock. 

Equity Activity. We anticipate generating
further cash from drawdowns in respect of capital committed by investors in Private Offerings. We have the authority to issue 500,000
shares of common stock at a 0.001 per share par value. Additionally, we have the authority to issue 15,000 shares of preferred stock
at a 0.001 per share par value. 

31 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had no common stock issuances. 

Borrowings. We expect to borrow
funds to make investments. This is known as leverage and may cause our financial results to be more volatile than if we
had not been leveraged. This is because leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of our net assets.
Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to
our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance (e.g.,
for every 100 of net assets, we may raise 200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities). Furthermore, while any indebtedness and
senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or repurchase our securities
unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratio requirements at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In connection with borrowings,
our lenders may require us to pledge assets, investor commitments to fund capital calls and/or the proceeds of those capital calls, thereby
allowing the lender to call for capital contributions upon the occurrence of an event of default under such financing arrangement. In
addition, the lenders may ask us to comply with affirmative or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 

Contractual Obligations. We have
entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have entered into an investment management agreement
(the Investment Management Agreement with the Adviser, pursuant to which the Adviser: determines the composition of our
portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; identifies, evaluates and
negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); determines
the assets we will originate, purchase, retain or sell; closely monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise
of any rights in our capacity as a lender; and provides us with such other investment advice, research and related services as we may,
from time to time, require. For these services, we will pay the Adviser the Management Fees and Incentive Fees (each as defined below)
described under the heading Compensation of Adviser below. 

We have also entered into an administration servicing
agreement (the Administration Agreement with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, doing business as U.S. Bank Global Fund Services U.S. Bank or the Administrator ), pursuant to which the Administrator provides the administrative and recordkeeping
services necessary for us to operate. In addition, we have entered into a fund accounting servicing agreement with U.S. Bank, pursuant
to which U.S. Bank will provide us with accounting services. 

32 

Hedging . We may, but are not required
to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks,
but we do not generally intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered
into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which
will be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements should we undertake them, may include the use of futures, options
and forward contracts. We will bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative
contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Valuation of Portfolio Securities 

In accordance with the procedures adopted by our
Board of Directors, the net asset value NAV per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined at least
quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. 

As a BDC, we will generally invest in illiquid
securities, including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. 

We expect that there will not be readily available
market values for many of the investments which are or will be in our portfolio, and we will value such investments at fair value as determined
in good faith by the Adviser, under the oversight of the Board, pursuant to the Adviser s valuation policy and process described
below. The factors that may be taken into account in determining the fair value of our investments generally include, as appropriate,
comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public,
the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted
cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase
transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate
or revise our valuation. Under current auditing standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty
with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements. 

33 

With respect to investments for which market quotations
are not readily available, the Adviser determines the fair values of such investments. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board
has designated the Adviser to perform the fair valuation determination, subject to Board oversight, pursuant to valuation procedures approved
by the Board of Directors, which follow a multi-step valuation process each quarter (or more frequently, as appropriate) as described
below: 

(1) 
 Our valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment and the Portfolio Committee of the Adviser; 

(2) 
 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and that of our Adviser; 

(3) 
 At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm. 

(4) 
 In following these approaches, the types of factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include, as relevant, but are not limited to: comparison to publicly traded securities, including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality; the enterprise value of a portfolio company; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earning and discounted cash flow; and the markets in which the portfolio company does business; 

(5) 
 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the valuations of the Adviser on a quarterly basis; and 

(6) 
 Our Board of Directors oversees our valuation process and in support of this oversight the Adviser provides periodic reports to the Board on valuation matters. 

Fair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price
that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the
principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of
observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs
reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent
of our Adviser. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the
best information available to us at the reporting period date. 

Dividends 

We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our
stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends and distributions will be subject to lawfully available funds
therefor, and no assurance can be given that we will be able to declare distributions in future periods. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we declared the following distributions: 

Record Date 
 Payable Date 
 Distribution Rate per Share 
 Distribution Paid 
 
 May 9, 2024 
 May 20, 2024 
 32.23 
 5,450,124 
 
 August 8, 2024 
 August 19, 2024 
 25.35 
 4,286,709 

34 

We have elected to be a BDC under the 1940 Act.
We also have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. To obtain and maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, we must, among other things, timely distribute
to our stockholders at least 90 of our investment company taxable income for each taxable year. We intend to timely distribute to our
stockholders substantially all of our annual taxable income for each taxable year, except that we may retain certain net capital gains
(i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) for reinvestment and, depending upon
the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following
taxable year and pay any applicable U.S. federal excise tax. We generally will be required to pay such U.S. federal excise tax if our
distributions in respect of a calendar year do not exceed the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals
and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses)
for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital
losses for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we did not pay any U.S. federal
income tax. If we retain net capital gains, we may treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. In that case, you will
be treated as if you had received an actual distribution of the capital gains we retained and then you reinvested the net after-tax proceeds
in our common stock. In general, you also will be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, obtain a tax refund) equal
to your allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to you. The distributions we pay to our stockholders
in a taxable year may exceed our taxable income for that taxable year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute
a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The specific tax characteristics of our distributions will be reported to stockholders
after the end of the calendar year. 

Security Transactions, Realized/Unrealized
Gains or Losses and Appreciation or Depreciation, and Income Recognition. 

Security transactions are recorded on a trade-date
basis. We measure realized gains or losses from the repayment or sale of investments using the specific identification method. The amortized
cost basis of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion/amortization of discounts and premiums and upfront loan
origination fees. We report changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the statement of operations. 

Compensation of Adviser 

Management Fee. Pursuant to the Investment
Management Agreement, our Adviser will accrue, on a quarterly basis in arrears, a management fee (the Management Fee equal
to 0.25 (i.e., 1.00 annually) of the average of our NAV (excluding uninvested cash and cash equivalents, which are defined for these
purposes as money market funds, U.S. government securities and investment grade debt instruments maturing within one year of purchase
of such instrument by us) at the end of the then-current calendar quarter and our NAV at the end of the prior calendar quarter. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred Management Fees of 1,302,443 and 1,065,753, respectively. 

Management Fees are generally expected to be paid
using available funds quarterly, in which case these payments will not reduce unfunded capital commitments. However, we may draw down
unfunded capital commitments in order to pay Management Fees, and any such drawdown amounts would reduce unfunded capital commitments. 

Incentive Fee. Pursuant to the Investment
Management Agreement, we will pay an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to the Adviser. The Incentive Fee will not be released
to the Adviser until the liquidation of our portfolio. The Incentive Fee will accrue as a liability on our Consolidated Statement of Assets
and Liabilities throughout our life, and we may set aside assets in anticipation of paying it. However, we do not intend to actually pay
out the Incentive Fee to the Adviser until the end of our life. 

35 

In order to determine the size of the Incentive
Fee, we will refer to the incentive fee calculation methodology described below (the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology ). 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Incentive Fee
Calculation Methodology is not intended to describe our actual operations with respect to the making of distributions, and the Incentive
Fee Calculation Methodology does not limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders over our life (other than our actual payment
of the Incentive Fee upon our liquidation). Rather, the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology is a tool whose sole purpose is to calculate
the size of the Incentive Fee. 

To calculate the size of the Incentive Fee, we
will refer to (1) the amounts and timing of stockholders contributions to us and (2) the amounts and timing of our distributions,
and will analyze those contributions and distributions under the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology. The Incentive Fee will equal the
total amount of distributions that would be made to the Adviser under paragraphs (c) and (d) of the Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology. 

The Incentive Fee Calculation Methodology is: 

(a) 
 First, we will make distributions to its stockholders until stockholders have received 100 of Contributed Capital (as defined below). 

(b) 
 Second, we will make distributions to its stockholders until stockholders have received a 7 return per annum, compounded annually, on their capital contributions, from the date each capital contribution is made through the date such capital has been returned. 

(c) 
 Third, we will make distributions to the Adviser under this paragraph (c) until it has received 12.5 of the total amount distributed by us under paragraph (b) and this paragraph (c). 

(d) 
 Thereafter, any additional amounts that we distribute will be paid 87.5 to stockholders and 12.5 to the Adviser. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
in no event will an amount be paid with respect to the Incentive Fee to the extent it would exceed the limitations set forth in Section
205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act. As of both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, no Incentive Fee has been accrued or is payable. 

Contributed Capital is the aggregate
amount of capital contributions that have been made by all stockholders in respect of their shares of our common stock. All distributions
(or deemed distributions), including investment income (i.e., proceeds received in respect of interest payments, dividends and fees) and
proceeds attributable to the repayment or disposition of any investment, to stockholders will be considered a return of Contributed Capital.
Unreturned Contributed Capital equals aggregate Contributed Capital minus cumulative distributions but is never less than zero. 

The term distribution includes all
distributions of our assets including in respect of proceeds from the full or partial realization of our investments and income from investing
activities and may include amounts treated as return of capital, ordinary income and capital gains for accounting, tax and/or other purposes. 

36 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

We are subject to financial market risks, including
changes in interest rates. We invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will
not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser,
overseen by the Board, in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith.
As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment
while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. 

In addition, any investments we make that are
denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the
possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and
potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets
and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net investment income of hypothetical base
rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our
investment and borrowing structure) in thousands. 

Basis Point Change 
 Interest Income 
 Interest Expense 
 Net Income 
 
 -25 Basis Points 
 (294 
 (71 
 (223 
 
 Base Interest Rate

 2,348 
 566 
 1,782 
 
 +300 Basis Points 
 3,590 
 850 
 2,740 

This analysis is indicative of the potential impact
on our investment income as of September 30, 2024, assuming an immediate and sustained change in interest rates as noted. In addition,
this analysis does not adjust for potential changes in our portfolio or our borrowing facilities after September 30, 2024 nor does it
take into account any changes in the credit performance of our loans that might occur should interest rates change. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period
covered by this report), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

37 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us or the Adviser. From
time to time, we or the Adviser may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation,
proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our and the Adviser s business
is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us and/or the Adviser. The outcome of any
legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and there can be no assurance whether any such proceedings will have
a material adverse effect on our or the Adviser s financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 

Except as previously reported by the Company on
its current reports on Form 8-K, the Company did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

We did not repurchase any of our equity securities
during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure 

Not applicable.

conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. 

We have adopted insider trading policies
and procedures governing the purchase, sale, and disposition of our securities by our officers and directors that are reasonably designed
to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations.
