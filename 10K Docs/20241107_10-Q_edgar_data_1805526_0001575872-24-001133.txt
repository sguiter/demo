Marketable Securities

In August 2024, the Company entered into a contract with a customer whereby the Company received common shares of the customer in exchange for the Company s services.

Under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 321 and Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-01, equity securities are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recorded to earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on the change in fair value of marketable securities of approximately 
 , which was included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the marketable securities was approximately .

Contingent Consideration

The Company measured the contingent consideration

liability at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which causes it to be classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of the contingent consideration liability uses assumptions and estimates the Company believes would be made by a market participant in making the same valuation. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions and estimates are obtained. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to updated assumptions and estimates are recognized within the statements of operations.

The fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Company s business combination is valued using the potential earnout payment schedule per the Groundbreaker Agreement, the underlying revenue projections of the Seller and revenue growth and volatility assumptions. In connection with the business combination, the Company utilized the following inputs for the fair value of the contingent consideration: industry revenue growth of ), revenue volatility of , a discount rate of and a term of years. The Company determined there was no change in fair value as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.

Future Equity Obligations

The Company measured the future equity obligations at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which causes it to be classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of the future equity obligations uses assumptions and estimates the Company believes would be made by a market participant in making the same valuation. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions and estimates are obtained. Changes in the fair value of the future equity obligations related to updated assumptions and estimates are recognized within the statements of operations.

The Company utilized a probability-weighted average approach based on the estimated market value of the underlying securities and the potential settlement outcomes of the future equity obligations, including a liquidity event or future equity financing as well as other settlement alternatives. Both the market value of the underlying securities and the probability of the settlement outcomes include unobservable Level 3 inputs.

 2. MANAGEMENT S 

 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and the other information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the SEC.

Overview

We provide a technology platform that connects commercial mortgage borrowers looking for debt to refinance, build, or buy commercial property including apartment buildings to commercial property lenders. These property lenders include traditional banks, credit unions, real estate investment trusts REITs ), debt funds, and other financial institutions looking to deploy capital into commercial mortgages.

We have developed an AI-enabled, B2B fintech marketplace platform that connects commercial borrowers and lenders, with a human touch. Commercial property owners, operators, and developers can quickly create an account on our platform, chat with our AI, set up their own profile and submit and manage loan requests on their dashboard in a digital experience. Our algorithms automatically match borrowers to their best loan option(s) or to our internal capital markets advisors (inbound sales team) that guide the borrower through the process and connect them with the right loan product and lender. Originators that work at commercial real estate mortgage lenders can log in and use their lender portal to view, sort, and engage with their new matches in real-time and communicate with the borrowers, tracking their loans right through our portal; they can setup the types of deals they are looking for as well. Our capital markets advisors have their own interface that gives them access to targeted loan opportunities, market intelligence, and data empowering them to better assist borrowers in managing their choices, leading to the best possible outcomes for both lenders and borrowers while building trust, all of which enhances our brand.

We currently have two different customer segments: lenders and borrowers. Borrowers include (but are not limited to) owners, operators, and developers of commercial real estate including multifamily properties and most recently, a growing segment of small business owners (which we believe represents a significant growth opportunity). Lenders include banks, credit unions, REITs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily lenders, FHA multifamily lenders, debt funds, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS lenders and Small Business Administration SBA lenders, and more.

Our business model includes earning a transaction fee each time a loan closes with a lender through our platform. We are either paid a share of the revenue from the transaction by the lender and/or receive some fixed sum in an amount we negotiate from the borrower. We receive compensation from both the lender and/or the borrower. Our average fee earned per transaction is approximately 1 of the loan amount generally earned at the time of closing. We do not make loans or share risk with the lenders, with whom we conduct business with. With the acquisition of Groundbreaker, our real estate syndication software and investor portal, and the recent launches of our Insurtech subsidiary, Janover Insurance Group, Janover AI (AI Software), Janover Engage 
 (equity marketplace)
 , and Janover Pro 
 (lender marketplace), 
 an increasing portion of our total revenue is now recurring software subscription revenue.

Strategy

In fiscal 2024, we plan to focus on our growth opportunities which are also the foundations of our competitive advantage. We are focused on executing in the following ways:

1.

 Expanding our sales channels beyond search engine optimization and inbound contacts from our websites into new sales channels and strategic and referral partnerships.

18 

2.

 Building out our product, enriching it with data and features, while making it easier for lenders to onboard, borrowers to access more options, and our internal capital markets advisors to provide deeper value to both borrowers and lenders. We will continue to enhance our AI capabilities to drive future productivity and growth opportunities. We aim to create a denser network and stickier experience for all stakeholders. 

3.

 Expanding our performance marketing within and beyond multifamily to accelerate our acquisition of high-intent office, retail, hotel, self-storage, and small business borrower accounts. 

4.

 Focusing on expanding our core-product suite through new product launches and M A opportunities that have similar characteristics to our Groundbreaker acquisition. These characteristics include but are not limited to predictable recurring revenue, high gross margins, cash flow or approaching cash flow positive, and a product line that will fit into our commercial real estate funnel and ecosystem. These M A candidates will complement our core business by upselling and cross selling both new and existing products. In 2024 we will also be focusing our attention to the commercial insurance space as we recently launched our new Insurtech subsidiary, Janover Insurance Group Inc. in January 2024, which recently received its Florida license approval in March 2024. We are also focused on expanding our recurring revenue through our suite of SaaS products with Groundbreaker, 
 real estate syndication software and investor portal, Janover 
 Engage (equity marketplace), Janover Pro (lender marketplace), and our Janover AI (AI Software). 
 In 2024, the Company started to market its artificial intelligence software technology AI Software ), its lender marketplace Janover Pro ), and its equity marketplace Janover Engage as a software as a service SaaS ). As of September 30, 3024, there was approximately 201,000 in deferred revenue, the majority of which is pertaining to these SaaS fees received in advance, which will be recognized in 2024 and 2025.

All of this will be done by continuing to:

1.

 Hire high-performing and aligned personnel to help us execute our strategy. 

2.

 Invest in our platform and technology. 

3.

 Cultivate a culture of creativity, hard work, innovation, curiosity, and community. 

Economic and Market Risks and Uncertainties in Our Business Model

We may be negatively impacted by periods of economic downturns, recessions, and disruptions in the capital markets, credit and liquidity issues in the capital markets, including international, national, regional and local markets, tax and regulatory changes and corresponding declines in the demand for commercial real estate investment and related services. Historically, commercial real estate markets and, in particular, the U.S. commercial real estate market, have tended to be cyclical and related to the flow of capital to the sector, the condition of the economy as a whole and the perceptions and confidence of market participants to the economic outlook. Cycles in the real estate markets may lead to similar cycles in our earnings and significant volatility in our stock price. Further real estate markets may lag behind the broader economy such that even when underlying economic fundamentals improve in a given market, additional time may be required for these improvements to translate into strength in the real estate markets. The lag may be exacerbated when banks delay their resolution of commercial real estate assets whose values are less than their associated loans.

Negative economic conditions, changes in interest rates, credit and the availability of capital, both debt and/or equity, disruptions in capital markets, the uncertainty of the tax and regulatory environment or declines in the demand for commercial real estate investment and related services in international and domestic markets or in significant markets in which we do business, have had and could have in the future a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. In particular, the commercial real estate market is directly impacted by (i) the lack of debt and/or equity financing for commercial real estate transactions, (ii) increased interest rates and changes in monetary policies by the U.S. Federal Reserve, (iii) changes in the perception that commercial real estate is an accepted asset class for portfolio diversification, (iv) changes in tax policy affecting the attractiveness of real estate as an investment choice, (v) changes in regulatory policy impacting real estate development opportunities and capital markets, (vi) slowdowns in economic activity that could cause residential and commercial tenant demand to decline, and (vii) declines in the regional or local demand for commercial real estate, or significant disruptions in other segments of the real estate markets could adversely affect our results of operations. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect the operation and income of commercial real estate properties.

These and other types of events could lead to a decline in transaction activity as well as a decrease in property values which, in turn, would likely lead to a reduction in financing fees relating to such transactions. These effects would likely cause us to realize lower revenues. Such declines in transaction activity and value would likely also significantly reduce our financing activities and revenues. Fiscal uncertainty, significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and similar significant changes in the global, political, security and competitive landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future. As a result, any revenue or earnings projections or economic outlook which we may give may be materially affected by such events. Fiscal 2023 was one of the most challenging years for the commercial real estate industry and the first half of fiscal 2024 has continued with this trend. However, we expect the overall outlook to improve in the second half of fiscal 2024.

19 

Seasonality

Traditionally, the commercial real estate market is seasonal in nature, with the first and fourth fiscal quarters being more active than the second and third fiscal quarters. However, during fiscal 2023 the commercial real estate market was less seasonal due to the significant macroeconomic pressures in the commercial real estate market.

Revenue

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 619,000 as compared to approximately 584,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 35,000, or 6 .

The average revenue per transaction was approximately 12,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 10,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This 26 increase in average revenue per transaction was the result of a change in the average loan size during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the similar period in the prior year. Our average revenue per transaction closed will vary from period to period, depending on the size of the underlying loan transactions in any given period. We will focus our efforts on revenue growth, with an emphasis on our most profitable cohorts of customers. We will target increasing both our number of transactions closed and our revenue per transaction closed. During fiscal 2024, we focused on larger loan opportunities, which should increase our average loan size. With the acquisition of Groundbreaker and the recent launch of our Insurtech, an increasing portion of our total revenue will transition to recurring revenue, where we receive annual, quarterly, and monthly subscriptions, and annual insurance premium commissions. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 approximately 22 of our total revenue was recurring revenue compared to 20 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. There was no recurring revenue for the comparable periods in fiscal 2023.

 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 subscription revenue was approximately 134,000 compared to 0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 our annual recurring revenue ARR run-rate reached approximately 480,000, compared to no annual recurring revenue in the prior year. ARR increased sequentially by approximately 58 , which was approximately 303,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. ARR represents an annualization of our recurring revenue, which assumes a full year of revenue.

Cost of Revenue

Sales and marketing expenses

Our sales and marketing costs are primarily comprised of personnel and advertising costs. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 299,000, compared to approximately 764,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of 465,000, or 61 . The majority of the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a decrease in employees and a reduction in stock issuances, compared to the same period in 2023. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased 49 , to approximately 15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 30,000 for the same period in the prior year, which was primarily due to a decrease in online advertising and other business development expenses. As we continue to improve the efficiency of our sales and marketing efforts, leveraging our search engine optimization and our artificial intelligence engine, we expect to continue to optimize our advertising and marketing expenses while lowering our customer acquisition costs to drive a more productive sales and marketing spend.

Research and development expenses

Our research and development costs are primarily comprised of personnel costs and software license fees to support the development of our marketplace. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 151,000, compared to approximately 247,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of approximately 96,000, or 39 . The majority of the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a reduction in stock issuances, compared to the same period in 2023. Offsetting this decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was a 64,000 increase to compensation and benefits due to an increase research and development related employees and consultants. We will continue to focus on developing our digital marketplace and our AI for the benefit of driving customer value on both sides of our marketplace which we believe will drive long term value to customers and our shareholders. 

General and administrative expenses

Our general and administrative costs include personnel costs, accounting, legal, rent, and other overhead expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 564,000 compared to approximately 1.2 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 647,000, or 53 . The majority of the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a reduction in compensation and benefits during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based issuances and a decrease in employees, compared to the same period in 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 there was a large decrease in stock-based compensation expense which was primarily related to the issuance of common stock upon our IPO for services, cancellation of employee stock options and issuance of common stock in connection with the IPO in the prior year.

Depreciation and amortization expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately 51,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 107 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization expense, which makes up the majority of the balance, relates to Groundbreaker s developed technology, which will be amortized over a three-year period. Depreciation expense relates to the company s fixed assets which comprises of computer equipment and furniture.

Other Income (Expense)

Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 17,000 compared to other income of approximately 60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a reduction of approximately 77,000, or 129 . The reduction in other income was primarily related to the change in fair value of marketable securities of approximately 52,000 at September 30, 2024. The reduction in other income was also related to a reduction in interest income of approximately 25,000 due to a reduced cash balance and interest rates, compared to the prior period.

Stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 9,000 compared to approximately 513,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 504,000 which was primarily related to the issuance of common stock upon our IPO for services, cancellation of employee stock options and issuance of common stock in connection with the IPO in the prior year. Offsetting this decrease was an increase in compensation and benefits expense of approximately 228,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in employees, compared to the same period in 2023.

Research and development expenses

Our research and development costs are primarily comprised of personnel costs and software license fees to support the development of our marketplace. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 479,000, compared to approximately 443,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 36,000, or 8 . The majority of the increase can be attributed to an increase in compensation and benefits expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in employees, compared to the same period in 2023. Offsetting this increase in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 200,000 reduction in stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to the issuance of common stock upon our IPO for services, cancellation of employee stock options and issuance of common stock in connection with the IPO in the prior year. We will continue to focus on developing our digital marketplace and our AI for the benefit of driving customer value on both sides of our marketplace which we believe will drive long term value to customers and our shareholders.

General and administrative expenses

Our general and administrative costs include personnel costs, accounting, legal, rent, and other overhead expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 2.0 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there was a large decrease in stock-based compensation expense which was primarily related to the issuance of common stock upon our IPO for services, cancellation of employee stock options and issuance of common stock in connection with the IPO in the prior year. Offsetting this decrease were increased costs associated with being a public company, which included professional fees and insurance, compared to the same period in 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately 173,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 107 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization expense, which makes up the majority of the balance, relates to Groundbreaker s developed technology, which will be amortized over a three-year period. Depreciation expense relates to the company s fixed assets which comprises of computer equipment and furniture.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 83,000 compared to other expense of approximately 37,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The majority of the other income balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represented interest income earned during the period. Offsetting other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of approximately 52,000 which represented a change in the fair value of marketable securities. The majority of the other expense balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represented a change in the fair value of future equity obligations. The change in fair value was primarily related to changes in the underlying assumptions for the valuation of future equity obligations, which were capitalized on our balance sheet in connection with our IPO, which took place in July 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital to fund our sales, marketing, research and development and administrative expenditures. To date, we have funded our liquidity requirements primarily through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, as well as equity and equity-related financing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 2.8 million and 5.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 8.9 million and incurred net losses of approximately 2.2 million during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Management believes capital is sufficient to sustain the Company s operating expenses for at least one year. We may continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future as we focus on revenue growth.

25 

Our business plan is focused on rapid growth to achieve significant market penetration over the shortest possible time horizon. We may raise additional capital in 2024 utilizing the recently filed registration statements to invest in research and development and sales and marketing to drive future growth.

Cash used in operating activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was approximately 2.2 million compared to approximately 908,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities was the result our increased net loss which is a result of investing our IPO proceeds in people and process to set up the company for future growth. This increase was also related to funding changes in our working capital balances, primarily accounts receivable, other assets, and accounts payable accounts.

Cash used in investing activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 cash used in investing activities was approximately 16,000 compared to approximately 9,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was related to the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of an intangible asset during the period.

Cash (used in) provided by financing activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was approximately 53,000 which the majority of the decrease was related to the accumulation of deferred offering costs in conjunction with future capital raises. During the quarter the company repurchased 10,322 shares of common stock for approximately 5,000, these shares were all cancelled by the end of the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the company had approximately 995,000 remaining in its share repurchase plan authorization, which was authorized by the Company s Board on November 15, 2023. Offsetting the decrease was the issuance of 17,595 common shares from the exercise of stock options within the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was approximately 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was the result of receiving 1.0 million of gross proceeds from the sale of Series B preferred stock in April, 2023 and the initial public offering in July 2023 for approximately 4.8 million in net proceeds. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share

To provide investors and the market with additional information regarding our financial results, we disclose (see below) adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share, non-GAAP financial measures that we calculate as net loss excluding; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization; and other income (expense). We have provided reconciliations below of adjusted EBITDA to net loss and adjusted EBITDA per share to earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

We have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share, herein, because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors.

26 

We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as, stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense from our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share, because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. In addition, we believe it is useful to exclude in our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share other income (expense), as neither are components of our core business operations. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share have limitations as financial measures, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share do not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures;

Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share do not reflect stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a material recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share do not reflect other income (expense); or changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; and

Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share differently, which reduces these measures usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share only as supplemental to, and alongside with other GAAP based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our other GAAP results.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per share for each of the periods indicated:

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company accounts for revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

Identification of a contract with a customer;

Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

Determination of the transaction price;

Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. 

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. The Company derives its revenue primarily from platform fees, which also includes referral and advisory fees. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied and the promised services have transferred to the customer. The Company's services are generally transferred to the customer at a point in time, which is when the underlying lending transaction has closed and successfully funded. The Company may act as an agent for both lenders and borrowers. Groundbreaker, which is a real estate syndication software and investor portal, which primarily derives its revenue from software as a service SaaS subscription fees, which is recognized over time throughout the term of the customer contract. Our Insurtech subsidiary, derives its revenue from subscriptions pertaining to annual insurance premium commissions, which is recognized at the start of the annual term, when the insurance coverage is bound. In 2024, the Company started to market its artificial intelligence software technology AI Software ), its lender marketplace Janover Pro ), and its equity marketplace Janover Engage as a software as a service. The revenue derived from these SaaS subscriptions will be recognized over the term of the SaaS agreement. As of September 30, 3024, there was approximately 201,000 in deferred revenue, the majority of which is pertaining to these SaaS fees received in advance. The revenue will be recognized in 2024 and 2025. 

Acquisitions, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangibles.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but are instead evaluated annually for impairment as part of the Company s annual financial review, or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. The annual test for impairment performed for goodwill can be qualitative or quantitative, taking into consideration certain factors surrounding the fair value of the goodwill including, level by which fair value exceeded carrying value in the prior valuation, as well as macroeconomic factors, industry conditions and actual results at the test date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that no impairment was necessary.

28 

Stock-Based Compensation

We record stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, 
 Compensation-Stock Compensation

 . All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employee s required service period, which is generally the vesting period.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.

I 

 TEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risks and inflation risks. Periodically, we maintain deposits in accredited financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. We deposit our cash in financial institutions that we believe have high credit quality and have not experienced any losses on such accounts and do not believe we are exposed to any unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash consists of cash in readily available checking accounts. We may also invest in short-term money market fund investments. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.

Inflation Risk

Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research and development contract costs. We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented.

I 

 TEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.

As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Our size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively segregate accounting duties which comprises a material weakness in internal controls. This lack of segregation of duties leads management to conclude that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to, increasing the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over our Exchange Act reporting disclosures.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
