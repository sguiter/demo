Overview AiS has been engaged in the development of a digital sports betting and gaming platform. When completed, our platform will provide users with sports content, racing and sports betting, fantasy sports, and sports streaming solutions. We aim to create excitement and engagement and deliver the best experiences that enhance sports fandom. Users can access our products via multiple devices, including the web and mobile devices. AiS is licensed in Australia via a provisional Northern Territory Online Bookmaking License which allows for racing, sports betting, and fantasy sports throughout Australia, which is one of the most mature legal betting markets in the world. In addition, we are licensed in North Dakota as an (ADW) provider, subject to completion of TRPB examination, which will allow us to provide pari-mutuel betting on racing in North Dakota and up to an additional 20 states that do not have specific regulations. NFL and other sports bets in the US are regulated separately from racing wagering and we will seek market access licenses for a number of states offering sports betting licenses over a 3-year timeline. Our two primary markets are the U.S. (in select states where we are licensed) and Australia. We will have separate websites for both markets, namely www.appleisports.com in the U.S. and www.appleisports.com.au in Australia. We have achieved the following milestones: Since the inception of AiS through September 30, 2024, we (i) established a core team with the industry skills and experience to manage the Company and (ii) we received approximately 3,064,900 in private placement funding and received loans from related parties in excess of 2,720,549 From December 2021 to October 2022, we developed our Go to Market outline and marketing strategy, including identifying preferred suppliers for each product and initiating relationships with key suppliers and consultants; 5 Table of Contents In February 2022, we re-launched a content-rich blog site on the appleisports.com and appleisports.com.au domains and initiated search engine optimization activities to increase the search performance of our site on Google search; In April 2022, we reached an agreement with a leading provider of Australian racing data and form information for use on our racing platform; In April 2022, we completed and submitted our application for a Northern Territory (NT) Online Bookmaking license. We appeared before the NT Racing Commission in May 2022 to present our application for approval. We expect the license to be issued in Q1 2025; In June 2022, we submitted our application to the North Dakota Racing Commission for an (ADW) license, subject to the approval of the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau. In parallel, we initiated a Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau (TRPB) examination process. The TRPB provides integrity reporting to regulators administering ADW licenses. We expect the TRPB examination to be completed in Q3 2024. Completion of the TRPB examination is required to receive a state-issued ADW; In October 2022, we engaged a leading provider of white-label sportsbook platforms and began customization and integration with key components (KYC, payments, CRM, credit card verification) and data feeds. The expected completion and product launch is September 2024; In May 2023, we began brand awareness and user harvesting actives by advertising around Australia on SEN Radio, the largest sports radio network in Australia. Advertising continued sporadically through August of 2024; In June 2023, we began User Acceptance Testing of our racing and sport betting platform with the NT Racing Commission. The expected completion date is Q2 2024; In July 2023, we entered into a licensing agreement with Seaport, Inc., a technology company, to incorporate their unique firmware and software called IPK.

The license agreement allows us to use the technology on our own platform with the ability to make the product available to other operators in the gaming space. We also will make the technology available to other iGaming companies that provide wireless iGaming. We expect to launch Casino in a Box in Q1 2025; In August 2023, we began engaging with connectivity and communications optimization with third parties and Native American-led service providers to develop a Class II online iGaming platform for the tribal casino market in the United States. This technology focus has led to the development of partnerships and offerings for gaming operators, both brick-and-mortar and online. The expected product launch for the tribal casino market is Q1 2025, and In January 2024, we began engaging with an establish ISP and networking technologies group regarding provision of broadband services to Native American tribal land. This capability, along with the IPK technology, will allow us to deliver the infrastructure needed to deploy broadband services that will enable Casino in a Box to operate in a sufficiently secure and fast manner, anywhere in North America. The expected launch date is Q1 2025. In March 2024 we began negotiations with an existing sportsbook operator with a well-established user base.

Our corporate structure is depicted below: 6 Table of Contents Results of Operations For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues During nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no revenues.

The increase in interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the increase principal balance on the related party debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had total 658,533 related to forgiveness of debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the company had no forgiveness of debt. This was related to the Company rescinding of the third-party intellectual property and reversal of 1,000,000 AUD of accounts payable and recognized forgiveness of debt income of 1,000,000 AUD 658,533). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we had net losses of 2,012,474 and 2,269,015, respectively, for the reasons discussed above. For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had no revenues. Operating Expenses During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had total operating expenses of 723,929 compared with 584,917 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses consisted of corporate expenses of 185,410 consulting and professional fees of 421,759 and selling, general and administrative expenses of 116,760. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, operating expenses consisted of corporate expenses of 242,927, consulting and professional fees of 166,021 and selling, general and administrative expenses of 175,969. The 23.77 increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to the increases in consulting and professional fees from the continued development of the Company s digital sports betting and gaming platform partially offset by decreases in corporate expenses from the cost containment measures the Company has implemented. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 20,756 of interest expense, net primarily attributable to related party debt compared with 14,108 of interest expense, net attributable to related party debt for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the increase principal balance on the related party debt. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 748,760 and 580,589 respectively, for the reasons discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 6,124,806 compared with a working capital deficit of 5,307,174 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital deficit is primarily a result of an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company received funds from private placements (See Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities below) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which enabled the reduction of these expenses. 7 Table of Contents The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. The following is a summary of the Company s cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (1,909,836 (1,145,645 Net cash used in investing activities (80,000 - Net cash provided by financing activities 1,944,271 1,071,029 Effect of changes in exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents 51,758 64,755 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 6,193 (9,861 Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 2,012,474 which after adjusting for decreases goods and services tax receivable of 22,369, along with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 415,675, accrued payroll of 236,924, accrued interest to related party of 60,701, accrued interest income of 1,990, prepaid and other assets of 16,120, and deposits of 39,512 along with foreign exchange loss of 3,124, forgiveness of debt of 658,533 and non cash expenses from stock issuance modification 80,000 resulted in net cash of 1,909,836 being used in operating activities during the period.

Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company loaned 80,000 to SeaPort, Inc. By comparison, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had no cash flows from investing activities. Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 1,944,271 from financing activities by way of 599,371 of net proceeds from related parties loans and 1,344,900 of proceeds from common stock issuances.

The Company is dependent upon receiving capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company or that the related parties will continue to fund the Company s working capital needs. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Contractual Obligations None. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have not identified any critical accounting estimates. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results which are found in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 8 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act Exchange Act as September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information was not accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Due to this material weakness, the Company s accounting for research and development expense for 2023 was not accurately accounted for and led to the restatement of the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023. In addition to the remediation steps discussed below, the Company has added additional steps to its internal financial review process in order to provide reasonable assurance that a reoccurrence of a material misstatement of any item in our financial statements will not occur. Effective disclosure controls and internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weaknesses. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. By enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. If we identify any new material weakness in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, other than the remediation steps addressed above there have been no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 9 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
