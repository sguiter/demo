 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

 million and an
accumulated deficit of approximately 
million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 
million and 
million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used cash of 
million in operating activities. 

In
October 2022, the Company entered into a sublease for approximately square feet of office and laboratory space in Somerville,
Massachusetts. Pursuant to the sublease, the Company delivered to the sublessor a security deposit in the form of a letter of credit
in the amount of million. The letter of credit was issued by the Company s commercial bank, which required that the Company
cash collateralize the letter of credit by depositing million in a restricted cash account with such bank. 

On
August 5, 2024, the sublessor drew down on the letter of credit for the full million to cover past due rent, plus penalties and
interest. On August 9, 2024, the Company and the sublessor entered into a sublease termination agreement, effective August 31, 2024.
See Note 8 for additional information regarding the sublease and sublease termination agreement.. 

In
April 2023, the Company entered into a standby equity purchase agreement (the ELOC and a registration rights agreement
with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to million
of the Company s common stock in an equity line financing arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Company issued and sold approximately shares of common stock under the ELOC for gross proceeds of million. shares were sold under the ELOC during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

In
July and December 2023, the Company received million in aggregate gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and on
January 11, 2024 it received an additional million in gross proceeds from the issuance of additional convertible notes. On September
24, 2024, the Company received million in aggregate gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and on October 29, 2024,
the Company received million in gross proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company s common stock. See Note 5 and Note
17 for additional information regarding these financings. 

In
connection with preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company s management concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern because it does not expect to have sufficient cash or working capital resources to fund operations for the
twelve-month period subsequent to the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company will need to raise
additional capital, which could be through the sales of shares of its common stock under the ELOC, public or private equity offerings,
debt financings, out-licensing the Company s intellectual property, strategic partnerships or other means. Other than the ELOC,
the Company currently has no arrangements for capital, and no assurances can be given that it will be able to raise capital when needed,
on acceptable terms, or at all. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

shares of common stock, which shares were subject
to a -month
lockup that expired in April 2024. The shares were issued to Exacis at a price based on the Company having an assumed equity valuation
of 
 million, divided by the number of issued and
outstanding shares of common stock as of the close of business two trading days prior to the closing date. For accounting purposes, the
shares issued were valued at 
 per share, which was the closing price of the
Company s common stock on the date of issuance. The Company additionally agreed to make certain contingent payments through April
23, 2026 related to achieving a market capitalization of million and million for a consecutive period of time (the Market
Cap Contingent Consideration ), as well as contingent payments related to the Company receiving proceeds related to the Purchased
License through April 23, 2028. 

The
Company accounted for the Exacis Acquisition as an asset acquisition because it determined that substantially all of the fair value of
the assets acquired was concentrated in the Purchased License. Assets acquired in an asset acquisition are recognized based on their
cost to the acquirer and generally allocated to the assets on a relative fair value basis. The Company s cost for acquiring the
Exacis Assets includes the issuance of the Company s common stock, direct acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration.
The table below shows the total fair value of the consideration paid for the Exacis Assets (in thousands). See Note 4 for more information
on the fair value measurement of the assets acquired. 

Contingent consideration 

Direct costs 

Total fair value 

The
Company allocated of the fair value of the consideration to the Purchased License, which the Company determined is an in-process
research and development IPR D asset. IPR D assets acquired through an asset purchase that have no alternative
future uses and no separate economic values from their original intended purpose are expensed in the period the cost is incurred. As
a result, the Company expensed the fair value of the Purchased License during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

On
September 24, 2024, in connection with entering into the Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement the Factor L C Agreement with Factor Bioscience Limited Factor Limited ), the Purchase License was terminated. See Note 10 for more information
on the Factor L C Agreement. 

million non-refundable up-front payment (the Option Fee for the Option Right and paid an initial payment of 
million to commence the cell line customization activities, per the amended payment terms. If Lineage obtained the sublicense, the
Company would be entitled to receive additional license fees, including milestone payments and royalties. 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company and Factor Bioscience (as defined in Note 10) entered into an agreement (the Lineage Assignment
Agreement under which the Company assigned the Lineage Agreement to Factor Bioscience. The Company s rights and obligations
under the agreement are now the responsibility of Factor Bioscience. 

Payments
to the Company related to the Lineage Agreement will be subject to the Lineage Assignment Agreement, which provides for Factor Bioscience
paying the Company thirty percent of all amounts it actually receives from Lineage in the event that Lineage exercises its Option
Right. Upon receipt of payment for the customization activities set forth in the Lineage Agreement, Factor Bioscience will pay the Company
twenty percent of all amounts Factor Bioscience receives from Lineage. 

The
Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 when a customer obtains
control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to receive in exchange
for those goods or services. 

Pursuant
to ASC 606, the Company determined that the Option Right was an unexercised right held by Lineage under the Lineage Agreement at contract
inception, as the cell line customization activities and the sublicense were optional purchases at contract inception. These optional
purchases of goods and services would be treated as separate contracts if and when Lineage determines that it would make such purchases.
Therefore, of the Option Fee was allocated to the Option Right. The Option Fee would remain in deferred revenue until such time
that Lineage entered into the sublicense or when the Option Right expired. However, as a result of the Lineage Assignment Agreement,
and there being no further obligations regarding the nonrefundable payment related to the Option Right, the Company recognized the 
million Option Right payment in full as revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
Option Right and the cell line customization activities were accounted for as separate contracts, and the Company determined that the
amended terms discussed above represented a modification to the cell line customization contract. Because there were no goods or services
transferred to Lineage before entering into the amendment, and therefore, previously recognized revenue, there was catch-up adjustment
to revenue required at the time of the amendment. 

Lineage
was to make payments to the Company for the cell line customization activities over the development period. The Company would only earn
the remaining full amount of the cell line customization fee if it made certain progress towards delivery of the customized cell line.
The Company determined that million of consideration received could be recognized without the probability of being reversed, and
it placed a constraint on the remaining contractual customization fee. The million was being recognized equally over the development
period. However, as a result of the Lineage Assignment Agreement, and there being no further obligations the Company must fulfill for
the customization activities, the Company accelerated the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue and recognized approximately
 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized approximately million in revenue during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the customization activities. 

The
Company recognized direct labor and supplies used in the customization activities as incurred, which are recorded as a cost of revenue.
As provided for in the A R Factor License Agreement discussed in Note 10, the Company was obligated to pay Factor Limited of
any amounts the Company received from a customer that was related to the licensed technology under the A R Factor License Agreement,
which is also recorded as a cost of revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized million
in license fees, which is recorded in cost of revenues, due to Factor Limited. There was such license fee incurred during the three
or nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million shares of its common stock (the July 2023 Warrants ). The Company recognized approximately million in fees associated
with the transaction. 

On
December 14, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with certain purchasers for the private placement of million of
convertible notes (the December 2023 Convertible Notes and together with the July 2023 Convertible Notes, the Convertible
Notes and warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of the Company s common stock (the December
2023 Warrants and together with the July 2023 Warrants, the Note Warrants ). 

There
were two closings under the December 14, 2023 purchase agreement one on December 15, 2023 and the second on January 11, 2024.
At the first closing, the Company received million and issued million of December 2023 Convertible Notes and December 2023
Warrants to purchase approximately million shares of its common stock. At the second closing, the Company received million and
issued million of December 2023 Convertible Notes and December 2023 Warrants to purchase approximately million shares its common
stock. 

See
Note 13 for more information on the Note Warrants. 

The
July 2023 Convertible Notes bear interest at per year, and the December 2023 Convertible Notes bear interest at per year, both
of which are payable quarterly in arrears. At the Company s election, it may pay interest either in cash or in-kind by increasing
the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes mature on the five -year anniversary of the date of their
issuance, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The Company does not have the option to redeem any of the Convertible Notes prior
to maturity. 

At
the option of the holders, the Convertible Notes may be converted from into shares of the Company s
common stock at an initial conversion price of, with respect to the July 2023 Convertible Notes, per share and, with respect to
the December 2023 Convertible Notes, per share, subject to customary adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalization
and the like. 

As
of September 30, 2024, none of the Convertible Notes were converted into shares of common stock. 

The
Convertible Notes provide for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods),
among others: nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Convertible Notes; the occurrence of
a material adverse effect event (as defined in the related securities purchase agreement) and certain events of bankruptcy. Generally,
if an undisputed event of default occurs and is continuing under the Convertible Notes, the holder may require the Company to
redeem some or all of their Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. As of September 30, 2024, there were no events of default that occurred under any
of the Convertible Notes. 

Bridge
Notes Financing 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with certain purchasers for the private placement of million of
convertible notes (the Bridge Notes ). The Bridge Notes bear interest at 12 per year, payable quarterly in arrears. At
the Company s election, it may pay interest either in cash or in-kind by increasing the outstanding principal amount of the Bridge
Notes. The Bridge Notes mature on the one -year anniversary of the date of their issuance, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The
Company does not have the option to redeem any of the Bridge Notes prior to maturity. The Bridge Notes financing closed on September
24, 2024. 

The
only conversion event for the Bridge Notes is upon stockholder approval at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders on October
29, 2024 (the Annual Meeting), in which case, of the principal amount of the Bridge Notes plus all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and, interest that would have accrued on the principal amount through December 24, 2024, will automatically convert into shares
of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of . Otherwise, the Bridge Notes may be paid in cash upon maturity. 

The Bridge Notes
have the same customary events of default provision as the Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2024, there were no events of default
that occurred under any of the Bridge Notes. 

The
Company was required to bifurcate the conversion feature from the Bridge Notes and record it as a derivative liability at its fair
value. The Company determined the fair value of the derivative liability by taking the difference between the fair value of the
Bridge Notes with the conversion feature and without the conversion feature, which resulting in the Company recording a 
million derivative liability, with a corresponding 
million reduction in the carrying value of the Bridge Notes recorded as a debt discount 
and a 
million charge to expense for the incremental fair value of the derivative liability as of September 24, 2024. The debt discount is are amortized over the
contractual terms of the Bridge Note as a component of interest expense. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company
remeasured the fair value of the Bridge Notes derivative liability and recorded a reduction in the liability of million. The corresponding credit of million is recorded as a component of the fair value adjustments to Bridge
Notes derivative liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, which also includes the million incremental expense noted above. 

Exchange
Transaction 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company entered into exchange agreements (the Exchange Agreements with the holders of (i) warrants
to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock the Company issued in December 2022 with an exercise
price of per share (the December 2022 warrants (ii) the July 2023 convertible notes and July 2023 warrants; and
(iii) the December 2023 convertible notes and the December 2023 warrants (the Exchange Transactions ). The parties to the
Exchange Agreements represent the holders of all the outstanding convertible notes and all the outstanding warrants described above except
for a December 2022 warrant to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock. 

Subject
to approval by the Company s stockholders at the Annual Meeting, under the Exchange Agreements (i) the holders of the warrants
agreed to exchange all their warrants for shares of the Company s common stock at an exchange ratio of of a share of common
stock for every one share of common stock issuable upon exercise of the applicable warrant (rounded up to the nearest whole number),
and (ii) the holders of the convertible notes agreed to exchange all their convertible notes for shares of the Company s common
stock at an exchange ratio equal to (A) the sum expressed in U.S. dollars of (1) the principal amount of the applicable convertible note,
plus (2) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the date the applicable convertible note is exchanged plus (3) all interest
that would have accrued through, but not including, the maturity date of applicable convertible note if it was outstanding from the date
such convertible note is exchanged through its maturity date (the sum of (A) totaling approximately million), divided by (B) 
(rounded up to the nearest whole number) (the Exchange Transactions ). 

The
Company determined that the modifications to the convertible notes should be accounted for as an extinguishment of debt because there
was at least a change in the cash flows of the modified debt instrument compared to the carrying amount of the original debt instrument,
and as such, the difference between the reacquisition price (which includes any premium) and the net carrying amount of the debt being
extinguished (which includes any deferred debt issuance costs) should be recognized as a gain or loss when the debt is extinguished. 

As
of September 24, 2024, prior to entering into the Exchange Agreements, there was approximately million of net carrying amount of
the convertible notes, which was comprised of million of principal and accrued interest through such date, offset by approximately
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The fair value of the reacquired convertible notes was million and was determined
by multiplying approximately shares the Company would be issuing on October 29, 2024 by the closing stock price of per
share on September 24, 2024. The difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the convertible notes being
extinguished was approximately million. Accordingly, the Company increased the carrying value of the reacquired convertible notes
to million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Because shareholder approval was required for the Exchange Transactions
to occur, the Company determined that the modifications to the warrants resulted in a change in classification of such warrants from equity
to liability. A provision that requires shareholder approval precludes equity classification because such approval is not an input into
a fixed-for-fixed valuation model. As a result, the Company recorded the warrants at fair value as of September 24, 2024 by taking the
number of shares of common stock issuable from the exchanged warrants multiplied by the closing stock price of and reclassified
approximately million from equity to warrant liabilities. The Company then marked-to-market the warrants as of September 30, 2024
by taking the same quantity of shares multiplied by the closing stock price on such date and recognized a reduction to the warrant liabilities
of million. A corresponding credit of million was recognized as a change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

Equity
Financing 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA with certain accredited investors
to sell in a private placement an aggregate of approximately shares of the Company s common stock (or, in lieu thereof,
pre-funded warrants to purchase one share of our common stock) for a purchase price of per share of common stock and per pre-funded warrant (the Common Stock Private Placement and together with the Bridge Notes
and the Exchange Transactions, the September 2024 Transactions ). The closing of the Common Stock Private Placement was
conditioned upon receiving stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting. 

The
SPA represents a forward sale contract obligating the Company to sell a fixed number of shares of its common stock at a fixed price per
share upon obtaining shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting. The Company measured the fair value of the forward sale contract as
the difference between (A) the fair value of the expected shares to be purchased by the investors as of the date the Company entered
into the SPA and (B) the purchase price of the shares, and recorded approximately million to additional paid-in capital as of September
24, 2024. Because of the concurrent execution of the SPA and the Exchange Agreements, and because the investors in the SPA are also parties
to the Exchange Transactions, the million was added to the million loss on extinguishment of debt discussed above for a total
loss of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

On
October 29, 2024, the Company held its Annual Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the September 2024 Transactions, and
as a result, the following occurred on October 29, 2024: 

Under
 the Common Stock Private Placement, the Company issued approximately shares of
 common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock and received
 approximately million in gross proceeds from the issuance of such securities. The pre-funded
 warrants have an exercise price of per share, are exercisable at any
 time and will not expire until exercised in full. 

Under
 the Bridge Notes, approximately million of the principal amount of the bridge notes
 plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, plus such amount of interest that would have
 accrued on the principal amount through December 24, 2024, was automatically converted at
 a conversion price of into approximately shares of the Company s common
 stock and approximately million of the principal amount of the bridge notes plus all
 accrued and unpaid interest thereon, plus such amount of interest that would have accrued
 on the principal amount through December 24, 2024, was automatically converted at a conversion
 price of into pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. The
 pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of per share, are exercisable
 at any time and will not expire until exercised in full. As of October 29, 2024, there were
 no Bridge Notes outstanding. 

Under
 the Exchange Transactions, (i) the holders of the warrants exchanged approximately 
 warrants for approximately shares of the Company s common stock, and (ii)
 the holders of the convertible notes exchanged all their convertible notes for approximately
 shares of our common stock for a total of shares of our common stock
 under the Exchange Transactions. As of October 29, 2024, there were no Convertible Notes
 outstanding. 

warrants in connection with a private placement during the first quarter of 2022 (the Q1-22
warrants ), which were determined to be classified as a liability. The Company also recorded the Market Cap Contingent Consideration
liability related to the Exacis Acquisition. See Note 3 for more information related to the Exacis Acquisition. 

In
connection with the Bridge Notes, the Company recorded a derivative liability as of September 24, 2024. In connection with the Exchange
Transactions, on September 24, 2024, the Company reclassified the warrants included in the Exchange Transactions from equity to a liability.
See Note 5 for more information related to the Bridge Notes and Exchange Transactions. 

The
Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the Q1-22 warrant liabilities and a Monte Carlo simulation
model to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Market Cap Contingent Consideration, both of which are
considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

The
Company determined the fair value of the derivative liability by taking the difference between the fair value of the Bridge Notes with
the conversion feature and without the conversion feature. 

With
respect to the warrants in the Exchange Transactions, the Company determined the fair value of the warrants as of September 24, 2024
by taking the number of shares of common stock issuable from the exchanged warrants multiplied by the closing stock price of and
reclassified approximately million from equity to warrant liabilities. 

The Company remeasures the fair value of the warrant liabilities , the Bridge Notes derivative liability and the Market Cap Contingent
Consideration at each reporting period and changes in the fair values are recognized in the statement of operations.

to the fair value of the Company s warrant liabilities or contingent consideration liabilities, which could also result in material
non-cash gains or losses being reported in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Fair value at September 30, 2024 

The
Company assessed the fair value of the Market Cap Contingent Consideration at September 30, 2024 and determined that there were no material
changes to the inputs used in the June 30, 2024 remeasurement that would have resulted in a material change to the liability at September
30, 2024. Therefore, the Company did not recognize a change in fair value of the Market Cap Contingent Consideration for the three months
ended September 30, 2024. 

The
Company remeasured the Bridge Notes derivative
liability by taking the difference between the fair value of the Bridge Notes with the conversion feature and without the conversion feature
as of September 30, 2024 and recorded a million credit for the change in fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The
carrying value of the Convertible Notes in the table above is reflective of the reacquisition price of the Convertible Notes as a
result of the Exchange Agreements entered into on September 24, 2024, which was recorded at its fair value as of September 24, 2024. The Company determined the fair value of the Convertible Notes by multiplying the million shares expected to
be issued in common stock on October 29, 2024 by the closing stock price of per share on September 30, 2024. 

The
carrying value of the Bridge Notes in the table above is shown before the bifurcation of the Bridge Notes derivative liability. The Company
determined the fair value of the Bridge Notes by multiplying the 
 million shares expected to be issued in common stock (or in pre-funded warrants)
on October 29, 2024 by the closing stock price of 
 per share on September 30, 2024 . 

See
Note 5 for more information on the Convertible Notes and the Bridge Notes. 

The
Company assessed the fair value of the 2023 convertible notes as of December 31, 2023 using a binomial model, which is considered a Level
3 measurement. 

 million related to the IRX acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value
of the entity is less than its carrying value. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify potential triggering events that
could indicate that the fair value of the entity is less than its carrying value and determined there were no such events that occurred. 

square feet in Somerville, Massachusetts. The sublease
provided for base rental payments of approximately million per month as well as monthly payments for parking and the Company s
share of traditional lease expenses, including certain taxes, operating expenses and utilities. The Company paid the Sublessor a security
deposit in the form of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million. 

On
May 3, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Sublessor regarding past due rent payments of approximately million, including
amounts related to property taxes and common area maintenance costs, that the Company did not pay for the months of February, March,
April and May 2024. Failure to pay the past due rent payments in full, plus approximately in late fees and interest, within five
business days from the date of the notice constitutes an event of default under the sublease. 

The
Company also did not pay the rent for June, July or August 2024 and, as of August 1, 2024, owed approximately million in the aggregate
in past due rent. On August 5, 2024, the Sublessor drew down on the letter of credit for the full million to cover the approximately
 million of past due rent payments, plus interest and penalties. 

On
August 9, 2024, the Company and Sublessor entered into a sublease termination agreement, effective August 31, 2024. The sublease was
originally scheduled to expire in 2033. Pursuant to the sublease termination agreement, the Company agreed to the following: to surrender
and vacate the premises; that the Company s right, title and interest in all furniture, fixtures and laboratory equipment at the
premises will become the property of the sublessor; and that both parties will be released of their obligations under the sublease. As
a result of the sublease termination, the Company recognized a gain on lease termination of approximately million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which includes a loss on disposal of fixed assets of approximately million.

Under
WO1, Factor Bioscience agreed to provide the Company with mRNA cell engineering research support services, including access to certain
facilities, equipment, materials and training, and the Company agreed to pay Factor Bioscience an initial fee of million, payable
in equal monthly installments of approximately million. Of the million, the Company allocated million to the License
Fee Obligation (as defined below). Following the initial 12-month period, the Company agreed to continue paying Factor Bioscience the
monthly fee of million until such time as WO1 is terminated. Upon entering into the MSA, the Company paid a deposit of million,
which will be applied to the last month of WO1. 

Under
the terms of an amendment to WO1, the Company may terminate WO1 on or after the second anniversary of the date of the MSA, subject to
providing Factor Bioscience with 75 days prior notice if such notice is provided no later than June 30, 2024. On June 26, 2024,
the Company provided Factor Bioscience with its notice to terminate WO1, which became effective on September 9, 2024. 

In
connection with entering into the MSA, Factor Limited entered into a waiver agreement with Eterna LLC, pursuant to which Factor Limited
agreed to waive payment of million otherwise payable to it (the License Fee Obligation in October 2022 by Eterna
LLC under the exclusive license agreement entered into in April 2021 among Eterna LLC, Novellus Limited and Factor Limited (the
 Original Factor License Agreement ). Under the waiver agreement, the License Fee Obligation is waived conditionally
on the Company paying Factor Bioscience a minimum of million due under the MSA. 

Because
the License Fee Obligation was conditionally waived until the Company paid Factor Bioscience a minimum of million under the MSA,
the Company recorded a liability of million. As of September 30, 2024, there was no License Fee Obligation liability remaining. 

In
September 2022, Novellus Inc. Novellus and the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Limited Waiver and Assignment
Agreement (the Waiver and Assignment Agreement with Drs. Matthew Angel and Christopher Rohde (the Founders whereby the Company agreed to be responsible for all future, reasonable and substantiated legal fees, costs, settlements and judgments
incurred by the Founders, the Company or Novellus for certain claims and actions and any pending or future litigation brought against
the Founders, Novellus and/or the Company by or on behalf of the Westman and Sowyrda legal matters described in Note 10 (the Covered
Claims ). The Founders will continue to be solely responsible for any payments made to satisfy a judgement or settlement of any
pending or future wage act claims. Under the Waiver and Assignment Agreement, the Founders agreed that they are not entitled to, and
waived any right to, indemnification or advancement of past, present or future legal fees, costs, judgments, settlement or other liabilities
they may have been entitled to receive from the Company or Novellus in respect of the Covered Claims. The Company and the Founders will
share in any recoveries up to the point at which the parties have been fully compensated for legal fees, costs and expenses incurred,
with the Company retaining any excess recoveries. The Company has the sole authority to direct and control the prosecution, defense and
settlement of the Covered Claims. 

In
November 2022, following the expiration of one of the milestone deadlines for certain regulatory filings required under the Third Amended
and Restated Exclusive License Agreement between Novellus Limited and Factor Limited entered into in November 2020 (the Novellus-Factor
License Agreement ), which permitted Factor Limited to terminate the license granted to Novellus Limited thereunder, the Company
entered into the first amendment to the Original Factor License Agreement (as amended, the 2021 Factor License Agreement ),
pursuant to which, among other things, Factor Limited granted to Eterna LLC an exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patents
owned by Factor Limited (the Factor Patents for the purpose of identifying and pursuing certain opportunities to grant
to third parties sublicenses to the Factor Patents. The Original Factor License Agreement also (i) terminated the Novellus-Factor License
Agreement, (ii) confirmed Factor Limited s grant to Eterna LLC of the rights and licenses Novellus Limited previously granted to
Eterna LLC under the Novellus-Factor License Agreement on the same terms and conditions as granted by Novellus Limited to Eterna LLC
under such agreement, (iii) confirmed that the sublicense granted by Novellus Limited in accordance with the Novellus-Factor License
Agreement to NoveCite, Inc., a company which the Company has a non-controlling interest NoveCite ), survived termination
of the Novellus-Factor License Agreement; and (iv) removed Novellus Limited from the Original Factor License Agreement and the license
agreement entered into on October 6, 2020 between Novellus Limited and NoveCite, Inc, as amended, and replaced Novellus Limited with
Factor Limited as the direct licensor to Eterna LLC and NoveCite under such agreements, respectively. 

On
February 20, 2023, the Company, entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Feb 2023 Factor Exclusive License Agreement with Factor Limited, pursuant to which Factor Limited granted to the Company an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain
patents owned by Factor Limited for the purpose of, among other things, identifying and pursuing certain opportunities to develop products
in respect of such patents and to otherwise grant to third parties sublicenses to such patents. The Feb 2023 Factor Exclusive License
Agreement, which terminated and superseded the Amended Factor License Agreement, was subsequently terminated and superseded by the A R
Factor License Agreement (as defined below). 

On
November 14, 2023, the Company entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement (the A R Factor License Agreement with Factor Limited to replace in its entirety the exclusive license agreement between the parties dated February 20, 2023 and the amendment
thereto. Under the A R Factor License Agreement, Factor Limited granted to the Company an exclusive, sublicensable license
under certain patents owned by Factor Limited (the Factor Patents ). The A R Factor License Agreement also provides
for, among other things, the expansion of the Company s license rights to include (i) the field of use of the Factor Patents to
include veterinary uses (ii) know-how that is necessary or reasonably useful to practice to the licensed patents, (iii) the ability to
sublicense through multiple tiers (as opposed to only permitting a direct sublicense) and (iv) the transfer of technology to the Company,
subject to the use restrictions in the A R Factor License Agreement. The A R Factor License Agreement was subsequently terminated
and superseded by the Factor L C Agreement discussed below. 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company entered into the Factor L C Agreement, effective as of September 9, 2024, with Factor Limited. The
Factor L C Agreement terminated the A R Factor License Agreement as well as the Purchased License that Exacis entered into with
Factor Bioscience on November 4, 2020, which the Company acquired pursuant to the Exacis Purchase Agreement with Exacis and certain stockholders
of Exacis on April 26, 2023. 

Under
the Factor L C Agreement, the Company has obtained exclusive licenses in the fields of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and rare diseases
with respect to certain licensed technology and has the right to develop the licensed technology directly or enter into co-development
agreements with partners who can help bring such technology to market. The Factor L C Agreement also provides for certain services
and materials to be provided by Factor Bioscience to facilitate the development of the licensed technology and to enable the Company
to scale up production at third party facilities. 

The
initial term of the Factor L C Agreement is one year after the effective date, and it automatically renews yearly thereafter. The
Company may terminate the Factor L C Agreement for any reason upon days written notice to Factor Bioscience, and the parties
otherwise have customary termination rights, including in connection with certain uncured material breaches and specified bankruptcy
events. 

Pursuant
to the Factor L C Agreement, the Company will pay Factor Bioscience approximately million per month for the first twelve months,
approximately million per month for the first nine months toward patent costs, certain milestone payments, royalty payments on net
sales of commercialized products and sublicensing fee payments. 

Exacis

On
November 15, 2022, prior to a decision on Westman s and Sowyrda s motion to compel or stay, the parties agreed to voluntarily
dismiss and consolidate the Delaware Actions with this action. On December 15, 2022, Sowyrda filed an Amended Answer to the Amended Complaint,
asserted affirmative defenses and filed Amended Counterclaims against Dr. Angel, Dr. Rohde, Novellus LLC, Novellus Inc., Factor Bioscience
Inc., and Eterna Therapeutics Inc. (collectively, the Counterclaim Defendants alleging against various Counterclaim Defendants
breach of contract, breaches of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, breaches of fiduciary duty, breaches of the operating
agreement, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with contract, equitable accounting, violations of the
Massachusetts Wage Act, Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wage Law, the Fair Labor Standards Act, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit. Also
on December 15, 2022, Westman filed an answer to the Amended Complaint and asserted similar counterclaims against the same Counterclaim
Defendants. Westman and Sowyrda each asserted claims for indemnification and/or advancement against Novellus, Inc. On January 11, 2023,
Westman and Sowyrda served a joint motion to enforce their advancement and/or indemnification rights against Novellus Inc. Novellus Inc.

in support of their motion to enforce indemnification/advancement rights, and submitted the motion to the Court. Novellus Inc. answered
Westman and Sowyrda s counterclaims on January 27, 2023, denying liability. The remaining Counterclaim Defendants served a motion
to dismiss most of the remaining counterclaims on January 27, 2023. The Court entered an order granting the Counterclaim Defendants 
motion to dismiss and denying Sowyrda and Westman s motion to enforce on June 15, 2023. The Court s order dismissed all of
Westman s claims against Counterclaim Defendants except his claim for indemnification, and all of Sowyrda s claims except
his claim for indemnification and his employment-related claims, which Counterclaim Defendants did not move to dismiss. On July 6, 2023,
Westman and Sowyrda filed a petition for interlocutory review with a single justice of the Massachusetts Appeals Court, seeking to overturn
the judge s decision granting the Counterclaim Defendants motion to dismiss most of the remaining counterclaims, but not
the decision denying Westman and Sowyrda s motion to enforce advancement rights. On July 25, 2023, the parties to the appeal filed
a joint motion to the single justice in the appellate court to stay the appeal to allow for amended counterclaims to be filed by Counterclaim
Plaintiffs and a motion to dismiss to be filed by Counterclaim Defendants. Counterclaim Plaintiffs filed an initial set of amended counterclaims
on August 15, 2023. Counterclaim Plaintiffs amended and refiled their amended counterclaims on September 29, 2023. Counterclaim Defendants
served their motion to dismiss all of the amended counterclaims, except for Sowyrda s employment-related claims, on October 13,
2023. On June 13, 2024, the motion to dismiss was denied and the court set a schedule for discovery limited to a threshold factual issue.
Discovery as to all other issues pertaining to the counterclaims was stayed. On July 15, 2024, Westman and Sowyrda requested that the
single justice in the appellate court continue to stay the appeal pending the outcome of the limited discovery ordered by the Court.
On July 31, 2024, Counterclaim Defendants and Sowyrda informed the Court that they had reached a settlement and requested that all claims
pending between them be dismissed with prejudice, and on August 9, 2024, the Court approved the motion for approval of dismissal of all
such claims with prejudice. Pursuant to the Court s order, Counterclaim Defendants are engaged in limited discovery with Westman..
The next Court conference is scheduled for November 18, 2024. 

Under
applicable Delaware law and Novellus Inc. s organizational documents, the Company may be required to advance or reimburse certain
legal expenses incurred by former officers and directors of Novellus, Inc. in connection with the foregoing Westman and Sowyrda matters.
However, a future advance or reimbursement is not currently probable nor can it be reasonably estimated.

Licensing
Agreements 

On
September 24, 2024, the Company entered into the Factor L C Agreement. See Note 10 for details of this agreement. 

Retirement
Savings Plan 

The
Company established a defined contribution plan, organized under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows employees
to defer up to of their pay on a pre-tax basis. Beginning on January 1, 2023, the Company began matching employees contributions
at a rate of of the first of the employee s contribution and of the next of the employee s contribution, for
a maximum Company match of . 

There
were no stock options granted during either of the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

On
January 1, 2024, Sanjeev Luther was appointed as President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. Upon his appointment,
he was granted a non-qualified stock option to purchase approximately shares of the Company s common stock. The stock
option has an exercise price of per share, which was equal to the fair market value (as defined in the 2020 Restated Equity Incentive
Plan) of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, will vest over , with of the shares vesting on the first
anniversary of the grant date and the remaining of the shares vesting in equal installments over the thereafter,
in each case, subject to continued service. The stock option was granted pursuant to the terms of Mr. Luther s employment agreement
and as a material inducement to his joining the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). 

On
April 26, 2024, the vesting terms of Mr. Luther s stock option award were amended so that the option vests over ,
with of the shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining of the shares will vest in equal 
installments over the remaining two years, in each case, subject to continued service. 

Since
the only modification to Mr. Luther s stock option award was to the vesting terms, there was no change to the fair value of the
stock option and the total compensation cost was unchanged. However, the total compensation cost will be recognized over three years
rather than four years, and as a result, the Company recognized approximately million in additional stock-based compensation expense
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the modification. 

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees, directors and certain consultants. The Company
estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock options granted is recognized
as expense over the requisite service period on a straight-lined basis.

Vesting
of all stock options is subject to continuous service with the Company through the applicable vesting date. As of September 30, 2024,
there were approximately shares of the Company s common stock subject to outstanding stock options. 

Restricted
Stock Units 

The
Company recognizes the fair value of RSUs as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For performance-based
RSUs, the Company begins recognizing the expense once the achievement of the related performance goal is determined to be probable. 

Outstanding
RSUs are settled in an equal number of shares of common stock on the vesting date of the award. An RSU award is settled only to the extent
vested. Vesting generally requires the continued employment or service by the award recipient through the applicable vesting date. Because
RSUs are settled in an equal number of shares of common stock without any offsetting payment by the recipient, the measurement of cost
is based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, which is the grant date. 

In
lieu of paying cash to satisfy withholding taxes due upon the settlement of vested RSUs, at the Company s discretion, an employee
may elect to have shares of common stock withheld that would otherwise be issued at settlement, the value of which is equal to the amount
of withholding taxes payable. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, less than RSUs vested. As of
September 30, 2024, there were less than RSUs outstanding. 

The
Company did t grant RSUs during either of the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

You
should read this discussion together with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes, and
other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q together with our audited consolidated
financial statements, related notes, and other information contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 14, 2023, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on March
18, 2024 (as amended, the 2023 10-K ). The following discussion contains or is
based on assumptions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including
those discussed under Risk Factors, in this report and in Part I, Item
1A of the 2023 10-K and as described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. These risks could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We
are a preclinical-stage cell therapy company. Our vision is to improve the lives of patients with difficult-to-treat diseases through
innovative, effective, and safe, but accessible cellular therapies, and our mission is to develop allogenic off-the-shelf cellular therapies,
leveraging induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC )-derived mesenchymal stem cells iMSCs to target solid tumors. 

Our
lead product ERNA-101 is allogenic IL-7 and IL-15-secreting iMSCs. ERNA-101 capitalizes on the intrinsic tumor-homing ability of MSCs
to slip through the tumor s defenses and to deliver potent pro-inflammatory factors directly to the tumor microenvironment TME ),
limiting systemic exposure and potential toxicity while unleashing potent anti-cancer immune responses including enhancement of T-cell
anti-tumor activity. Our initial focus is to develop ERNA-101 in triple negative breast cancer and platinum-resistant, tp53-mutant ovarian
cancer. We collaborated with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to investigate the ability of ERNA-101 to induce and modulate
antitumor immunity in ovarian cancer and breast cancer model. We are expecting to complete the Investigational New Drug IND enabling studies and IND submission by 2026. We are also planning to investigate anti-inflammatory cytokine (e.g. IL-10)-secreting iMSCs
in inflammatory/auto-immune disorders like Rheumatoid arthritis. We are actively seeking strategic partnerships to co-develop or out-license
therapeutic assets and engage with potential collaborators to expand developmental opportunities.

Agreements
with Factor Bioscience 

License
Agreement 

On
September 24, 2024, we entered into the Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement the Factor L C Agreement with
Factor Bioscience Limited Factor Limited ). The Factor L C Agreement terminated the Amended and Restated Factor License
Agreement (the A R Factor License Agreement entered into on November 14, 2023 as well as an exclusive license agreement
we acquired from Dilos Bio (formerly known as Exacis Biotherapeutics Inc. Exacis )) under an asset purchase agreement in
April 2023. 

Under
the Factor L C Agreement, we have obtained an exclusive license in the fields of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and rare diseases
with respect to certain licensed technology and we have the right to develop the licensed technology directly or enter into co-development
agreements with partners who can help bring such technology to market. The Factor L C Agreement also provides for certain services
and materials to be provided by Factor to facilitate our development of the licensed technology and to enable us to scale up production
at third party facilities. 

The
initial term of the Factor L C Agreement is one year after the effective date, and it automatically renews yearly thereafter. We
may terminate the Factor L C Agreement for any reason upon 90 days written notice to Factor, and the parties otherwise have
customary termination rights, including in connection with certain uncured material breaches and specified bankruptcy events. 

Pursuant

Lineage
Assignment Agreement 

On
September 24, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Factor Bioscience Inc. Factor whereby we assigned the exclusive
option and license agreement (the Lineage Agreement to Factor (the Lineage Assignment Agreement ). Our rights
and obligations under the agreement are now Factor s responsibility. 

24 

Payments
related to the Lineage Agreement will now be subject to the Lineage Assignment Agreement, which provides for Factor paying us thirty
percent (30 of all amounts it actually receives from Lineage in the event that Lineage exercises its Option Right. Upon receipt of
payment for the customization activities set forth in the Lineage Agreement, Factor will pay the Company twenty percent (20 of all

Termination
of Sublease 

In
October 2022, we entered into a sublease for office and laboratory space in Somerville, Massachusetts. In connection with entering into
the sublease, we delivered a security deposit in the form of a letter of credit in the amount of 4.1 million. The letter of credit was
collateralized with 4.1 million of cash deposited in a restricted account. 

On
August 5, 2024, the sublessor drew down on the letter of credit for the full 4.1 million to cover the approximately 4.0 million of
past due rent payments for February 2024 through August 2024, plus interest and penalties. 

On
August 9, 2024, we and the sublessor entered into a sublease termination agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate
the sublease effective August 31, 2024. Pursuant to the sublease termination agreement, we agreed to surrender and vacate the premises,
all of our right, title and interest in all furniture, fixtures and laboratory equipment at the premises will become the property of
the sublessor, and both parties will be released of their obligations under the sublease. As a result of the sublease termination, we
recognized a gain on lease termination of approximately 1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we expect
to save approximately 72 million in base rental payments, parking, operating expenses, taxes and utilities that we would have paid over
the remaining lease term. 

Nasdaq
Matters 

On March 19, 2024, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff Staff of The Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC Nasdaq stating that we were not in compliance with the Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(1) (the Minimum
Stockholders Equity Rule because we reported stockholders equity of less than 2.5 million as of December 31, 2023.
The notice had no immediate effect on our Nasdaq listing. In May 2024, we submitted a plan to Nasdaq advising
of actions we have taken or will take to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule. Nasdaq accepted our plan
and granted us a 180-day extension, or through September 16, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule.
On September 17, 2024, we received a notice from the Staff stating that the Staff has determined that we
did not meet the terms of the extension to confirm or demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule by September
16, 2024, and, as a result, unless we request an appeal of such determination by September 24, 2024, trading of our common stock will
be suspended at the opening of business on September 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove our securities
from listing and registration on Nasdaq. On September 24, 2024,we submitted a timely request for a hearing with the Nasdaq s Hearings
Panel to appeal the Staff s determination. The request stayed the suspension of trading of our common stock and the filing of the
Form 25-NSE pending the Hearing Panel s decision. The hearing was scheduled for November 12, 2024. 

After
giving effect to (i) the reclassification of the debt represented by the convertible notes to equity as a result of the exchange of the
convertible notes that occurred on October 29, 2024, (ii) the receipt of net proceeds we received in the October 2024 private placement
of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and (iii) the reclassification of the debt represented
by the bridge notes to equity as a result of the conversion of the bridge notes into shares of our common stock or pre-funded warrants
to purchase shares of our common stock, and after taking into account the savings resulting from the termination of our former sublease,
our stockholders equity exceeds 2.5 million on a proforma basis as of September 30, 2024, which we communicated in our pre-hearing
submission of materials to the Hearing Panel on October 23, 2024. Additionally, due to issuing over 45.9 million shares of common stock
from the transactions described above and having a total of 51.4 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of October
29, 2024, the market value of our listed securities has exceeded the minimum of 35 million under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for
ten consecutive trading days. As a result, the Staff informed the Company that is has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)
and our stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. Accordingly, the Hearing Panel cancelled the November 12, 2024 hearing.

Basis
of Presentation 

Revenue 

In
February 2023, we entered into the Lineage Agreement with Lineage, under which we granted Lineage an option to obtain an exclusive sublicense
to certain of our technology for preclinical, clinical and commercial purposes in exchange for a non-refundable up-front payment to us
of 0.3 million. In August 2023, Lineage requested that we begin developing certain induced pluripotent stem cell lines in exchange for
a cell line customization fee. Lineage paid us 0.4 million towards the customization fee, which we were recognizing ratably over the
customization period. On September 24, 2024, we entered into the Lineage Assignment Agreement with Factor Inc. to assign all our rights
and obligations under that the Lineage Agreement to Factor Inc. Payments to us related to the Lineage Agreement will now be subject to
the Lineage Assignment Agreement, which provides for Factor Inc. paying the us thirty percent (30 of all amounts it receives
from Lineage in the event that Lineage obtains a sublicense from Factor Inc. Upon receipt of future payments for the customization activities
set forth in the Lineage Agreement, Factor Inc. will pay the us twenty percent (20 of all amounts Factor Inc. receives from Lineage.
Because we have no further obligations under the agreement with Lineage, we have fully recognized as revenue amounts previously recorded
in deferred revenue of approximately 0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information,
see Note 4 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. We have no other revenue generating contracts at this time. 

Cost
of Revenues 

We
recognize direct labor and supplies associated with generating our revenue as cost of revenues. As provided for in the A R Factor
License Agreement discussed in Note 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we were obligated to pay Factor
Limited 20 of any amounts we receive from a customer that was related to the licensed technology under the A R Factor License Agreement,
which we also recognize as a cost of revenue. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

We
expense our research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for company-sponsored
research and development activities, as well as support for selected investigator-sponsored research. Upfront payments and milestone
payments we make for the in-licensing of technology are expensed as research and development in the period in which they are incurred
if the technology is not expected to have any alternative future uses other than the specific research and development project for which
it was intended. 

The
major components of research and development costs include salaries and employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, supplies
and materials, preclinical study costs, expensed licensed technology, consulting, scientific advisors and other third-party costs, and
allocations of various overhead costs related to our research and development efforts. 

We
have contracted with third parties to perform various studies. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract
and may result in uneven payment flows. We accrue for third party expenses based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended
during the reporting period. If the actual timing of the performance of the services or the level of effort varies from the estimate,
the accrual is adjusted accordingly. The expenses for some third-party services may be recognized on a straight-line basis if the expected
costs are expected to be incurred ratably during the period. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of
certain events or milestones, the successful enrollment of patients, the allocation of responsibilities among the parties to the agreement,
and the completion of portions of the clinical study or trial or similar conditions. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other costs, including equity-based compensation, for
our executive and administrative personnel, legal and other professional fees, travel, insurance, and other corporate costs.

Revenue 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we fully accelerated the recognition of approximately 0.5 million of deferred revenue
related to nonrefundable payments we received from Lineage due to the Lineage Assignment Agreement we entered into on September 24, 2024
with Factor Inc. discussed earlier. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the revenue we recognized was related to
customization activities performed for Lineage. 

Cost
of Revenue 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of revenues included direct labor and materials to perform the customization cell
line activities for Lineage. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a credit for amounts previously accrued
related to customization cell line activities that were no longer due as a result of entering into the Lineage Assignment Agreement with
Factor Inc. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized direct labor and materials related to the customization
activities as well as the 20 license fee due to Factor Limited related to upfront payments received from Lineage under the customer
agreement.

to a reduction in consultant services, payroll-related expenses and stock-based compensation from a reduction in headcount, MSA/license
fees as a result of the new L C Agreement and other expenses related to closing down a clinical trial we ended in 2022.

Our
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreases in professional fees related to legal services and consultants,
rent expense due to the termination of our Somverville sublease effective August 31, 2024 and a reduction in insurance premiums. These
decreases were offset by increases in payroll-related expense and stock-based compensation due to an increase in headcount as well as
an inducement stock option grant given to our chief executive officer in January 2024 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. 

Our
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased occupancy expense related to the Somerville sublease that we began
to incur in July 2023 as well as increased stock-based compensation due to the chief executive officer s inducement stock option
grant. The increase in occupancy expense was partially offset by decreases in professional fees related to legal services and consultants,
insurance expense due to lower premiums and payroll-related expenses resulting from a decrease severance expense during the nine months
ended September 20, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gain
on Lease Termination 

On
August 9, 2024, we and the sublessor of our Somerville sublease entered into a sublease termination agreement effective August 31, 2024.
Pursuant to the sublease termination agreement, we agreed to surrender and vacate the premises, all of our right, title and interest
in all furniture, fixtures and laboratory equipment at the premises will become the property of the sublessor, and both parties will
be released of their obligations under the sublease. As a result of the sublease termination, we recognized a gain on lease termination
of approximately 1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement
of operations. There was no similar transaction during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Acquisition
of Exacis In-Process Research and Development 

In
April 2023, we acquired from Exacis substantially all of its intellectual property assets, including all of its right, title and interest
in and to the Purchased License. The Purchased License was determined to be an in-process research and development IPR D asset that has no alternative future use and no separate economic value from its original intended purpose, which is expensed in the
period the cost is incurred. As a result, we expensed the fair value of the Purchased License of approximately 0.5 million during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
included in this report. There was no similar transaction during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt 

We
recognized a 22.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the Exchange
Agreements and common stock private placement entered into on September 24, 2024. There was no similar transaction during the three or
nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information
on the Exchange Transaction. 

Fair Value Adjustments to Bridge Notes Derivative Liability 

We
recognized expense of 1.6 million related to the initial measurement at September 24, 2024 of the incremental fair value of the
bridge notes derivative liability over the carrying value due to bifurcation of the conversion feature from the bridge notes. This was offset by a 0.6 million credit for the change in fair value of
the bridge notes derivative liability due to remeasuring the liability as of September 30, 2024. There
was no similar transaction during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 5 to the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements for more information on the bridge notes. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

We
recognized credits of less than 0.8 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the change in
the fair value of warrant liabilities, which includes certain warrants that were reclassified to a liability
on September 24, 2024. The credits were due to a decrease in the market price of our common stock as of September 30, 2024. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized credits of less than 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively,
for the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities due to a decrease in the market price of our common stock as of September
30, 2023. See Note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the reclassification of
the warrants. 

29 

Change
in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 

On
the closing date of the acquisition of assets from Exacis in April 2023, we recognized a contingent consideration liability of 0.2 million
for future payments that may be payable to Exacis, which was included as part of the 0.5 million fair value of the Purchased License
asset and expensed as IPR D for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This contingent consideration liability is remeasured at
each period end, and any change in the fair value of the contingent liability is recognized in the statement of operations. As of September
30, 2023, we remeasured the contingent liability and recognized a credit of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
due to the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. As of September 30, 2024, we remeasured the contingent
liability and recognized a credit of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the decrease in the fair value
of the contingent consideration liability. There were no amounts recognized for either of the three months ended September 30, 2023 or
2024. 

Loss
on Non-Controlling Investment 

We
account for our 25 non-controlling investment in NoveCite, Inc. NoveCite under the equity method. We have not guaranteed
any obligations of NoveCite, nor are we otherwise committed to providing further financial support for NoveCite. Therefore, we only record
25 of NoveCite s losses up to our investment carrying amount. As a result, we did not recognize additional losses related to NoveCite
for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recognized a loss of approximately
 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Expense, net 

We
recognized an increase in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 1.6 million and 3.2
million, respectively, primarily due to interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the 2023 convertible
note financings and bridge notes when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result of the closing of the
Exchange Transactions on October 29, 2024, we expect our future interest expense to be significantly decreased. 

Other
Expense, net 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 0.3 million of other expense, all of which related to the value of the
commitment shares issued to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park under a standby equity purchase agreement
(the ELOC we entered into in April 2023 as well as other associated fees. We did not recognize any such expense
during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a de minimus amount of other expense during the three months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

During
2024, we expect to incur state income tax liabilities related to our operations. We have established a full valuation allowance for all
deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss carryforwards, since we could not conclude that we were more likely than not able
to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due primarily to
our full valuation allowance. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 4.3 million, of which approximately 3.9 million was from proceeds from the
bridge notes received on September 24, 2024, and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 225.8 million. We have to date
incurred operating losses, and we expect these losses to continue in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, we incurred a net loss of 26.6 million and 38.8 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used
 12.3 million of cash in operating activities. 

30 

On
October 29, 2024, we also received approximately 1.1 million upon the closing of the common stock private placement. Other than the
proceeds raised under the bridge notes and the common stock private placement, our sole source of liquidity is through sales of our common
stock under the ELOC, pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to 10.0 million of our common stock. Such sales of common
stock by us, if any, are subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in the ELOC, including a condition that we may not direct
Lincoln Park to purchase any shares of common stock under the ELOC if such purchase would result in Lincoln Park beneficially owning
more than 4.99 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Sales under the ELOC may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion,
through April 2025. To date, we have issued and sold approximately 214,000 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, including approximately 74,000 commitment shares, and have received approximately 0.3 million in gross proceeds from such sales. We sold no shares
under the ELOC during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Based
on our current financial condition and forecasts of available cash, we will not have sufficient capital to fund our operations for the
12 months following the issuance date of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. We can provide no assurance that
we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we cannot raise capital when needed, on favorable
terms or at all, we will need to reevaluate our planned operations and may need to reduce expenses, file for bankruptcy, reorganize,
merge with another entity, or cease operations. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets,
and might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders may lose
all or part of their investment in our common stock. See the risk factor in Item 1A of Part II of our 2023 10-K titled, We will require substantial additional capital to fund our operations and
execute our business strategy, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. 

Historically,
the cash used to fund our operations has come from a variety of sources and predominantly from sales of shares of our common stock and
of convertible notes. We will continue to evaluate and plan to raise additional funds to support our working capital needs through public
or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships, out-licensing our intellectual property or other means. There can
be no assurance that capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us and our
stockholders. Our ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors including, among others,
market conditions, the trading price and volume of our common stock, and investor sentiment. In addition, macroeconomic factors and volatility
in the financial market, which may be exacerbated in the short term by concerns over inflation, interest rates, impacts of the wars in
Ukraine and the Middle East, strained relations between the U.S. and several other countries, and social and political discord and unrest
in the U.S., among other things, may make equity or debt financings more difficult, more costly or more dilutive to our stockholders. 

In
addition, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders, and debt financings may
subject us to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in our assets. If we raise capital through collaborative
arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or grant sublicenses on terms that are not favorable to
us. 

We
prepared the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will realize our
assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business. As discussed above, there is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern because we do not have sufficient cash to satisfy our working capital needs and other liquidity requirements
over at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty
of our ability to remain a going concern. 

In
addition, while we are not presently pursuing product development, we may do so in the future. Developing product candidates, conducting
clinical trials and commercializing products requires substantial capital, and we would need to raise substantial additional funds if
we were to pursue the development of one or more product candidates.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

There
was a decrease of approximately 3.5 million in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the same period in 2023. This change was due to a decrease in cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 2.0 million primarily
related to a reduction in amounts due for the buildout costs of the Somerville facility and a 1.4 million decrease in net loss, after
giving effect to adjustments made for non-cash transactions, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

We
used approximately 0.3 million to pay for the purchases of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There
were no investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately 5.3 million of gross proceeds
received from the convertible note financings that occurred in January 2024 and September 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes approximately 8.7 million of gross proceeds from convertible note financings and
 0.3 million of proceeds received from selling approximately 214,000 shares to Lincoln Park under the ELOC. The Company did not sell
any shares under the ELOC during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

There
were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from those described
in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the 2023 10-K.

Under
the rules and regulations of the SEC, as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information otherwise required
by this item.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we were required to apply our judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation as of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including
our President and Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and our Senior Vice President of Finance (who
serves as our principal financial officer) of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in providing reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives due primarily to the material weakness discussed below. 

Management s
Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

We
were unable to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March
31, 2022 with the SEC due to identifying errors in our financial statements reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 during our preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Management
concluded that the errors were the result of accounting personnel s lack of technical proficiency in complex matters. On June 30,
2022, we filed an amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 to correct the errors in
our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the quarters ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020,
March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. 

Management
has implemented measures designed to ensure that the deficiencies contributing to the ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting are remediated, such that the internal controls are designed, implemented and operating effectively. The remediation actions
to date include: 

enhancing
 the business process controls related to reviews over technical, complex, and non-recurring transactions; 

providing
 additional training to accounting personnel; and 

using
 an external accounting advisor to review management s conclusions on technical, complex and non-recurring matters. 

The
material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and
management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As of September 30, 2024, we continue to season
and enhance such controls to ensure that they will continue to operate effectively for a sufficient period of time before management
can make conclusions on the operating effectiveness. 

We
are committed to developing a strong internal control environment, and we believe the remediation efforts that we have implemented and
will implement will result in significant improvements in our control environment. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate
the relevance of our risk-based approach and the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an
ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
for the actions intended to remediate the material weakness as described above, there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

or test marketing programs or non-registrational studies or other similar programs or studies where the Licensed Product is supplied
without charge or at the actual manufacturing cost thereof (without allocation of indirect costs or any mark-up) determined in accordance
with IFRS. 

If
a Licensed Product is sold as part of a Combination Product in a country in the Territory, Net Sales for the Licensed Product included
in such Combination Product in such country will be calculated as follows: 

i. if
 the Licensed Product is sold separately in such country and the Additional Active Ingredient(s)
 in the Combination Product are sold separately in finished form in such country, Net Sales
 for the Licensed Product shall be calculated by multiplying actual Net Sales of such Combination
 Product in such country by the fraction A/(A+B), where A is the weighted (by sales volume)
 average gross invoice price of the Licensed Product when sold separately in finished form
 in such country and B is the weighted (by sales volume) average gross invoice price of the
 Additional Active Ingredient(s) included in the Combination Product when sold separately
 in finished form in such country; 
 
 ii. if
 the Licensed Product is sold separately in finished form in such country but the Additional
 Active Ingredient(s) in the Combination Product are not sold separately in finished form
 in such country, Net Sales for the Licensed Product shall be calculated by multiplying actual
 Net Sales of such Combination Product in such country by the fraction A/D, where A is the
 weighted (by sales volume) average gross invoice price of the Licensed Product when sold
 separately in finished form in such country and D is the weighted (by sales volume) average
 gross invoice price of the Combination Product in finished form in such country; 
 
 iii. if
 the Licensed Product is not sold separately in finished form in such country but the Additional
 Active Ingredient(s) in the Combination Product are sold separately in finished form in such
 country, Net Sales for the Licensed Product shall be calculated by multiplying actual Net
 Sales of such Combination Product by the fraction 1- (B/D), where B is the weighted (by sales
 volume) average gross invoice price of the Additional Active Ingredient(s) in the Combination
 Product when sold separately in finished form in such country and D is the weighted (by sales
 volume) average gross invoice price of the Combination Product in finished form in such country;
 or 
 
 iv. if
 neither the Licensed Product nor the Additional Active Ingredient(s) in the Combination Product
 are sold separately in finished form in such country, the Parties shall determine Net Sales
 for the Licensed Product in such Combination Product by mutual agreement based on the relative
 contribution of the Licensed Product and each Additional Active Ingredient to the Combination
 Product, and shall take into account in good faith any applicable allocations and calculations
 that may have been made for the same period in other countries.

Confidentiality
and Publicity 

7.1
 Confidential Information . Each Party shall maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence, and
will not disclose, divulge or otherwise communicate such Confidential Information to others, or use it for any purpose, except pursuant
to, and in order to carry out, the terms and objectives of this Agreement, or with the express written consent of the Party who provided
such Confidential Information. Each Party will maintain the confidentiality of the other Party s Confidential Information using
methods and practices that are substantially similar to those that the receiving Party uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own
confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Except as may be authorized in advance in writing by
the disclosing Party, the receiving Party will only grant access to the Confidential Information to its employees and agents as necessary
to carry out activities under this Agreement and such employees and agents will have entered into non-disclosure agreements consistent
with the terms of this Section 7.1. The obligations of confidentiality described above will not pertain to that part of any Confidential
Information to the extent that it is supported by competent written proof that: 

a. such
 information was lawfully in the receiving Party s possession or control prior to the
 time it received the information from the disclosing Party (except to the extent received
 in confidence under the Original Agreement); 
 
 b. such
 information was developed by the receiving Party independently of and without reference to
 the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; 
 
 c. such
 information was, at the time it was disclosed to or obtained by the receiving Party, or thereafter
 became, available to the public through no act or omission of the Party holding such information;
 or 
 
 d. such
 information was lawfully obtained by the receiving Party from a Third Party that has the
 right to disclose such information free of any obligations of confidentiality. 

In
addition, a receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the limited extent required to do so by Applicable Law or a
proper legal, governmental or other competent authority, or by the rules of any securities exchange on which any security issued by either
Party is traded, or included in any filing or action taken by the receiving Party to obtain or maintain government clearance or approval
to market a subject Licensed Product. Except where impracticable, such required Party shall give the other Party reasonable advance notice
of such disclosure requirement and shall afford the other Party a reasonable opportunity to oppose, limit or secure confidential treatment
for such required disclosure, or, where it is impracticable to give an advance notice, such required Party shall give the other Party
reasonable notice promptly after such required disclosure. In the event of any such required disclosure, the required Party shall disclose
only that portion of the Confidential Information legally required to be disclosed. 

In
addition, either Party may disclose Confidential Information, including this Agreement, and the terms hereof (including providing a copy
hereof, redacted as appropriate) to any bona fide potential licensor, licensee, partner or permitted Sublicensee or successor to said
Party s interest under this Agreement, to a bona fide potential lender from which said Party is considering borrowing money, to
a bona fide potential collaborator in connection with development or commercialization of Licensed Products, to any bona fide financial
investor from which said Party may take money, to any insurance broker, business, financial or scientific consultants, attorneys, and
accountants; provided, however, in any such case said Party shall first obtain a written obligation of confidentiality, non-disclosure
and non-use no less stringent than those imposed in this Section 7.1 (or in the case of attorneys or other professionals, an equivalent
professional duty of confidentiality) from the bona fide potential licensor, licensee, partner, permitted Sublicensee or successor, bona
fide potential lender, bona fide potential collaborator, bona fide financial investor, insurance broker, business, financial or scientific
consultant, attorney or accountant. 

21 

7.2
 Use of Names . Neither Party may identify the other Party in any promotional advertising or other promotional materials to be disseminated
to the public or any portion thereof, or use the name of any staff member or employee of the other Party or any trademark, service mark,
trade name, symbol or logo that is associated with the other Party, without the other Party s prior written consent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, without the consent of the other Party either Party may comply with disclosure requirements
of all Applicable Laws relating to its business, including United States and state securities laws. Each Party may include the other
Party s name, logo, and a brief description of such other Party on said Party s website. 

7.3
 Press Releases . The Parties shall mutually agree upon the timing and content of any press releases or other public announcement
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, provided, however, that either Party or its Affiliates may disclose
the relevant terms of this Agreement to the extent required to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission or any equivalent governmental agency or Applicable Law in any country in the Territory, provided that such Party
shall use reasonable efforts to redact sensitive information and shall submit a confidential treatment request in connection therewith,
after consultation with the other Party. 

Section
8 

Dispute
Resolution 

8.1
In the event of any dispute or disagreement between Licensor and Licensee as to the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement
or any other related document (or the performance of any obligations hereunder or thereunder), the matter, upon written request of either
Licensor or Licensee, shall be referred to representatives of Licensor and Licensee for decision, each such Party being represented by
an Executive Officer (the Representatives ). The Representatives shall promptly meet and use good faith efforts
to resolve the dispute. If the Representatives do not mutually agree upon a decision within thirty (30) calendar days (as extended by
the last sentence of this Section 8.1) after reference of the matter to them, the Parties shall submit to mediation by a single independent
mediator, with expertise and experience applicable to the subject matter of the dispute, mutually agreeable to the Parties and in accordance
with procedures as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. If the dispute is not resolved pursuant to such mediation (including
if the Parties are unable to mutually agree on the selection of a mediator or the relevant procedures for such mediation), then each
of the Licensor and Licensee shall be free to exercise the remedies available to it under Section 8.2. Each of the Licensor and Licensee
may extend the period of time for negotiation among the Representatives for an additional period of thirty (30) calendar days on one
(1) occasion per dispute. 

8.2
If the Licensor and Licensee are unable to resolve such dispute pursuant to Section 8.1, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration
(without any recourse to the federal or state courts except to enforce any arbitral award or, within forty five (45) days of an Arbitrator s
rendering of a final decision, to appeal such final decision based solely on a claim that the Arbitrator engaged in gross misconduct
or made a material error or miscalculation in his or her decision) in accordance with the rules of JAMS JAMS then in force (except as expressly modified below), and the arbitration hearings shall be held before a single arbitrator Arbitrator in Boston, Massachusetts. The Licensor and Licensee agree to appoint an Arbitrator who is knowledgeable in the biotechnology and/or life
sciences industries. If the Licensor and Licensee cannot agree upon an Arbitrator within ten (10) days after a demand for arbitration
has been filed with the JAMS by either of them, either or both of the participating Licensor and Licensee may request the JAMS to name
a panel of five (5) candidates to serve as Arbitrator. The participating Licensor and Licensee shall each, in successive rounds (with
the Party demanding the arbitration having the first chance to strike a name), strike one name off this list until only one name remains,
and such last-named person shall be the Arbitrator. In the event that the dispute involves a claim of more than 5,000,000, then instead
of one Arbitrator, there shall be three (3) Arbitrators who are knowledgeable in the biotechnology and/or life sciences industries, with
each Party selecting one (1) Arbitrator and the two (2) Arbitrators so chosen, shall select a third arbitrator, who shall serve as the
chair of the arbitration panel. 

22 

8.3
The Arbitrator shall be required to (a) follow the substantive rules of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Federal law, as applicable,
(b) have all testimony be transcribed, and (c) accompany his or her award with findings of fact and a statement of reasons for the decision.
The Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to permit discovery for no more than thirty (30) days, to the extent deemed appropriate by
the Arbitrator(s), upon reasonable request of a participating Party. The Arbitrator(s) shall have no power or authority to (i) add to
or detract from the written agreement of the Parties set forth herein, (ii) modify or disregard any provision of this Agreement or any
of the other related documents, or (iii) address or resolve any issue not submitted by the Parties. The Arbitrator(s) shall hold proceedings
during a period of no longer than thirty (30) calendar days promptly following conclusion of discovery, and the Arbitrator(s) shall render
a final decision within thirty (30) days following conclusion of the hearings. The Arbitrator(s) shall have the power to grant injunctive
relief (without the necessity of a Party posting a bond) in the event a Party has violated the confidentiality provisions set forth in
this Agreement, but shall have no power to award punitive and/or exemplary damages in the event of a breach. In the event of any conflict
between the commercial arbitration rules then in effect and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
prevail and be controlling. 

8.4
Either Licensor or Licensee may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, apply to the Arbitrator(s) for interim injunctive relief
until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either Licensor or Licensee also may, without waiving
any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any injunctive or provisional relief necessary to protect the
rights regarding the Intellectual Property or Confidential Information of that Party pending the arbitration award. The Arbitrator(s)
shall have no authority to award punitive or any other type of damages not measured by a Party s compensatory damages.

that a final judgment in any such litigation shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection which it may ever
have to the laying of venue of any such litigation in such courts, (b) any claim that any such litigation brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (c) any claim that such court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such litigation.
As used in this Section 10.6 , the term Excluded Claim means a dispute, controversy or claim that concerns:
(x) the scope, construction, validity or infringement of a Patent or copyright; or (y) any antitrust, antimonopoly or competition law
or regulation, whether or not statutory; or (z) Licensee s or, as applicable, Licensee s Affiliates or Sublicensee(s), Exploitation

Other
Provisions 

9.1
If any of the provisions of this Agreement shall contravene the laws of any country, it is agreed that such invalidity or illegality
shall not invalidate this Agreement, but instead this Agreement shall be construed as if it did not contain the provision(s) claimed
or held to be invalid or illegal in the particular jurisdiction concerned, insofar as such construction does not materially affect the
substance of this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be construed and enforced accordingly. In the
event, however, that such claimed invalidity or illegality shall substantially alter the relationship between the parties hereto, materially
affecting adversely the interest of either party in such jurisdiction, then the parties hereto shall negotiate an alternative provision
not conflicting with such laws so as to maintain, to the degree reasonably possible, the business and economic benefits and liabilities
as initially set forth herein. 

9.2
This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and cancels and supersedes all
other agreements or understandings leading up to the execution of this Agreement, except as expressly stated otherwise. Without limiting
the foregoing, as of the Effective Date, the Parties hereby terminate the Original Agreement in its entirety except that (a) all payment
obligations that have accrued under the Original Agreement but that remain unpaid by Licensee as of the Effective Data (i) shall survive
and be deemed payment obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) Licensee shall pay Licensor all such accrued amounts no later than ten
(10) days following the Effective Date and (b) Sections 1, 2.4, 3.4, 5.1-5.3, 6.3-6.5, 8.1 (with respect to Improvements and Improvement
Patents (as defined in the Original Agreement) that were created or discovered on or before March 31, 2024), 8.6, 9.1-9.2, 10, and 11of
the Original Agreement shall survive such termination and apply to the activities of the Parties under the Original Agreement prior to
the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, ownership of Party Improvements and Party Improvement Patents that were created or discovered
on or following April 1, 2024 shall be determined in accordance with Section 5.1 of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Original Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the Prior Agreement (as such term is defined in the Original Agreement).
The Parties further acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Exacis Agreement
is hereby terminated as of the Effective Date. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding upon the parties
unless made in writing and signed on behalf of the parties by their respective duly authorized representatives. In the event of any conflict
between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and those of any Exhibit or other document, the following order of precedence will
govern: (a) first, this Agreement, excluding its Exhibits; (b) second, the Exhibits to this Agreement as of the Effective Date; and (c)
third, any other documents incorporated herein by reference. 

9.
3 In the event of a transfer or assignment of one or more of the Licensed Patents by Licensor, the assignee thereof shall take such assignment
subject to the rights, licenses, privileges, releases, non-assertions, and immunities granted under this Agreement. This Agreement will
be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each Party and each Party s respective transferees, successors and assigns, pursuant
to the provisions set forth below. Neither Party may transfer or assign this Agreement (i) without the prior written consent of the other
Party, provided that if such transfer or assignment is to an Affiliate of such Party, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, or (ii) as otherwise provided in this Section 9.3. In the event that a Third Party (the Acquiring
Party acquires all or substantially all of a Party s business, capital stock or assets, whether by sale, merger,
change of control, operation of law or otherwise (an Acquisition ), the rights granted to such Party under
this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Acquiring Party. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of an Acquisition, the Acquiring
Party will be responsible for all payments and other obligations set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all payments
set forth herein, and any obligations that matured prior to the Acquisition date. Upon an Acquisition, payment thereof shall remain an
ongoing obligation of the Acquiring Party until such amount is paid in full. Any attempted assignment in contravention of this Section
9.3 will be null and void. 

24 

9.4
No act, delay, or omission by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any right, power, or remedy of such party unless such waiver is in
writing, and then only to the extent set forth therein. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded to
a party, shall be cumulative and not alternative. No waiver of any provision, right or remedy under this Agreement on any one occasion
shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, right, or remedy on said occasion or the same or any other provision, right, or remedy
on any other occasion. 

9.5
This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

9.6
All rights, licenses, privileges, releases, non-assertions, and immunities granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by Licensor to

the Bankruptcy Code. The parties hereto agree that Licensee, as licensee of such rights under this Agreement, shall retain and may fully
exercise all of their rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code. The parties hereto further agree that, if a Bankruptcy Code case
is commenced by or against Licensor and this Agreement is rejected as provided in the Bankruptcy Code, then Licensor (in any capacity,
including debtor-in-possession) and their successors and assigns (including, without limitation, a Bankruptcy Code trustee) shall take
such steps as are necessary to permit Licensee to exercise all of their rights under this Agreement. All rights, powers, and remedies
of Licensee provided under this Section are in addition to and not in substitution for any and all other rights, powers, and remedies
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity (including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code) in the event of any such commencement
of a bankruptcy proceeding by or against Licensor. Licensee, in addition to the rights, powers and remedies expressly provided herein,
shall be entitled to exercise all other such rights and powers and resort to all other such remedies as may now or hereafter exist at
law or in equity (including the Bankruptcy Code) in such event. 

9.7
Any notice required to be given pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given
at the time when actually received as a consequence of any effective method of delivery, including but not limited to hand delivery,

an employment, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties hereto or any of their agents or employees, or any
other legal arrangement that would impose liability upon one Party for the act or failure to act of the other Party. Neither Party will
have any express or implied power to enter into any contracts or commitments or to incur any liabilities in the name of, or on behalf
