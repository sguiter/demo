Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Report and in our other Securities
and Exchange Commission filings. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates, and other forward-looking statements that
involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report.
These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below. 

Overview 

BTC Digital Ltd. we , us 
 our and the Company is a crypto asset technology company based in the U.S. with a focus on bitcoin mining.
We also generate revenue through mining machines resale and rental business operations. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we generated a substantial majority of our revenue from mining machines resale and bitcoin mining. We store all of our bitcoins mined
in hot wallets, or cryptocurrency wallets connected to the Internet, and may from time to time exchange bitcoins mined for fiat currency
to generate cash flow to fund our business operations. We attribute our growth since we launched our crypto asset business in 2022 to
our competitive strengths in diversified revenue streams, dedicated team and efforts towards regulatory compliance, and our experienced
and visionary management team. 

As of September 30, 2024, we owned a total of
2021 mining machines under operation with a total hash rate of 213PH/S. We manage and operate our mining machines at one hosting facility
operated by a hosting facility owner in New Tazewell, Tennessee. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we mined a total of 18.26
bitcoins, generating US 1.05 million in revenue. As of now, all of the Company s mining machines have been relocated to the newly
acquired mining facility in Arkansas. 

Historically, the price of bitcoins has fluctuated
significantly. The profitability of our bitcoin mining operations and our operation results have been and will continue to be directly
impacted by the trading price of bitcoins. To mitigate these risks, we have launched a mining machines resale and rental business. We
have maintained business relationship with a major machine manufacturer, AGM Technologies Ltd, from which we source mining machines on
an order-by-order basis, often at prices lower than market prices. We will then resell mining machines when there is a shortage of machines
available on the market and resale prices are higher. Additionally, from time to time, we rent out our mining machines to customers at
a rate calculated based on the total bitcoins mined. We seek to rent out a greater percentage of our fleet at times when bitcoin prices
are lower to generate cash flow. 

We believe research and development capacities
are key to our continued long-term growth and will afford us with the ability to mine bitcoins with greater hash rate and power efficiency
and the opportunity to further expand our service or product offerings and diversify our revenue streams. Through the Joint Venture (as
defined below), we have participated in the design and development of equipment dedicated for mining machines and infrastructure, including
high voltage power supply, liquid-cooling systems, and hash boards. In the near future, we plan to continue investing in research and
development and the Joint Venture and accumulate knowledge in the cryptocurrency industry. 

Results of Operations 

The following table sets forth a summary of our
consolidated results of operations, both in absolute amounts and as a percentage of total net revenue, for the period indicated. This
information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in our annual report
on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for any future period.

Our total revenue increased by 202.84 from US 0.8 million in the three
months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 2.6 million in the three months ended of September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily
driven by gains in our mining machine resale and miner rental businesses, which contributed an additional US 2.1 million and US 0.4 million,
respectively. However, revenue from Bitcoin mining declined by US 0.7 million this quarter compared to the same period last year, a decrease
of 86.9 , primarily due to the following factors. First, the Group allocated more of its existing Bitcoin mining machines for rentals
in the third quarter, impacting direct mining revenue. Second, the recent Bitcoin halving event led to a reduction in Bitcoin production.
Lastly, a batch of newly acquired T21 mining machines remains in customs clearance and has not yet been deployed, further affecting our
mining output for the quarter. 

Cost of Revenues 

Our total cost of revenues increased by 103.46 
from US 1.4 million in the three months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 2.8 million in the three months ended of September
30, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by the expansion of our mining machine resale business, which incurred additional procurement
costs to support higher sales volumes. Additionally, the miner rental business added further operational costs, contributing to the overall
rise in expenses. Together, these factors reflect our strategic growth in new business segments, although they have led to a substantial
increase in the cost of revenues compared to the same period last year. 

Gross Loss and Gross Profit Margin 

As a result of the foregoing, our gross loss decreased by US 280 thousand,
from US 541 thousand in the three months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 261 thousand in the three months ended of September 30, 2024.
Our gross loss margin improved from 64 in the three months ended of September 30, 2023 to 10.2 in the three months
ended of September 30, 2024. 

25 

Selling and Marketing Expenses 

Our selling and marketing expenses increased from
nil in the three months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 63 thousand in the three months ended of September 30, 2024. The increase in
selling expenses this quarter was primarily due to the addition of our mining machine resale business. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses increased by 42.48 from US 153
thousand in the three months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 218 thousand in the three months ended of September 30, 2024. This
increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of employees and daily office expenses resulting from business development. 

Interest Expenses 

Our interest expenses was US 11 thousand and US 2 thousand for the
three months ended of September 30, 2023 and 2024. This reduction is consistent with the decrease in short-term loans. 

Equity in Income on Equity Method Investments 

Our gain on equity method investments was US 5 thousand and US 50 thousand
for the three months ended of September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 

Loss Before Income Tax 

As a result of the foregoing, we had a loss before income tax of US 1,007
thousand for the three months ended of September 30, 2023, as compared to a loss before income tax of US 571 thousand for the three months
ended of September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of US 1,007 thousand
for the three months ended of September 30, 2023, as compared to a net loss of US 571 thousand for the three months ended of September
30, 2024.

Our total revenue decreased by 7.3 from US 8.1 million in the nine
months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 7.5 million in the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. Revenue from our Bitcoin mining
business decreased by US 1.1 million, a decline of 52 , primarily due to the following factors. First, the Group allocated more of its
existing Bitcoin mining machines for rentals in the third quarter, impacting direct mining revenue. Second, the recent Bitcoin halving
event led to a reduction in Bitcoin production. Lastly, a batch of newly acquired T21 mining machines remains in customs clearance and
has not yet been deployed, further affecting our mining output for the quarter. Revenue from miner rental and other mining-related
businesses increased by US 0.5 million, an increase of 116 , primarily due to the Group s increase in Bitcoin mining machine rentals
during the period, which led to a corresponding rise in rental income. 

Cost of Revenues 

Our total cost of revenues decreased by 7.28 from US 8.8 million
in the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 8.1 million in the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. Overall, the decrease
in cost of revenues was largely in line with the decline in revenue. 

Gross Loss and Gross profit Margin 

As a result of the foregoing, our gross loss decreased by US 48 thousand,
from US 651 thousand in the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 603 thousand in the nine months ended of September 30, 2024.
Our gross profit margin improved from -8.6 in the three months ended of September 30, 2023 to -8.0 in the three months ended of September
30, 2024. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses 

Our selling and marketing expenses decreased from
US 198 thousand in the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 159 thousand in the nine months ended of September 30, 2024, primarily
due to the Group s strengthened control over selling expenses and optimization of expenditures. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses increased
by 56.46 from US 1.0 million in the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 1.5 million in the nine months ended of September
30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the rise in expenses related to the Employee Stock Option Plan, which amounted to US 0.57
million. 

27 

Interest Expenses 

Our interest expenses decreased from US 61 thousand
for the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 to US 17 thousand for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. This reduction is consistent
with the decrease in short-term loans. 

Equity in Income on Equity Method Investments 

Our gain on equity method investments was US 6
thousand and US 75 thousand for the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 

Loss Before Income Tax 

As a result of the foregoing, we had a loss before
income tax of US 2,122 thousand for the nine months ended of September 30, 2023, as compared to a loss before income tax of US 2,006 thousand
for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss
of US 2,122 thousand for the nine months ended of September 30, 2023, as compared to a net loss of US 2,006 thousand for the nine months
ended of September 30, 2024. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our consolidated financial statements
which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also use adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA as additional non-GAAP financial
measures. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate its operating performance.
We also believe that such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating
our consolidated results of operations in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods
and to those of its peer companies. 

Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA should
not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to net income/(loss) or any other measure of performance or as indicators
of our operating performance. Investors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable
GAAP measures. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by
other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures
to our data. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial
measure. 

Adjusted net income represents net income/(loss)
before share-based compensation and offering expenses. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of our adjusted net income for the
periods indicated:

the current law of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains tax. In addition, dividend payments are not subject
to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. 

British Virgin Islands 

Under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands,
companies formed in the British Virgin Islands are not subject to tax on income or capital gains.

Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, which requires our management to make judgment, estimates and assumptions that affect our reporting of, among other
things, assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates
and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of relevant current business and other conditions, our
expectations regarding the future based on available information and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, which together
form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral
component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require
a higher degree of judgment than others in their application. 

The selection of critical accounting policies,
the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in
conditions and assumptions are factors that should be considered when reviewing our financial statements. We believe the following accounting
policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. You should read the
following description of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and other disclosures included herein. 

Share-based compensation 

Share-based compensation costs are measured
at the grant date. The compensation expense in connection with the shares awarded to employees is recognized using the straight-line method
over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, with such estimate updated periodically and with actual
forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. In determining the fair value of the shares awarded to employees,
the discounted cash flow pricing model has been applied. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal sources of liquidity have been from
cash generated from operating activities. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had US 43,000 and US 27,000, respectively,
in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand placed with banks or other financial institutions and
highly liquid investment which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use and have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. 

We intend to finance future working capital requirements
and capital expenditures from cash generated from operating activities, and funds raised from financing activities, including the net
proceeds we received from the transactions. We believe that our current available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. 

However, we may require additional cash resources
due to the changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investment or acquisition we may decide to selectively
pursue. If our existing cash resources are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell equity or equity-linked securities,
sell debt securities or borrow from banks. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable
to us, if at all. The sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of
indebtedness and issuance of debt securities would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants
that restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.

cash flows for the periods presented:

Operating Activities 

Net cash generated from operating activities amounted
to US 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between our net loss of US 2.1 million and the net cash
used in operating activities was primarily due to (i) depreciation of US 2.3 million; (ii) net loss on disposal of property and equipment
of US 0.3 million; (iii) increase in accounts receivable of US 3.4 million; and (iv) decrease in prepayments and other current assets
of US 1.1 million; partially offset by decrease in accounts payable of US 3.2 million. 

Net cash generated from operating activities amounted
to US 3.4 million for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. The difference between our net loss of US 2.0 million and the net cash
used in operating activities was primarily due to (i) depreciation and amortization of US 2.7 million; (ii) decrease in accounts receivable
of US 3.8 million, primarily due to the collection of receivables from mining machines resale; and (iii) increase in prepayments and other
current assets of US 1.2 million, mainly due to an increase in advance payments for purchases. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities amounted
to US 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment
of US 1.8 million, repayment of advances to related parties of US 1.3 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities amounted
to US 4.3 million for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. This was primarily attributable to the purchases of property and
equipment of US 4.0 million, repayment of advances to related parties of US 0.7 million and advances from related parties of US 0.4 million. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash generated from financing activities amounted
to US 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily attributable to (i) the proceeds from issuance of ordinary
shares for private placement of US 1.9 million, (ii) proceeds from short term loans of US 0.6 million; partially offset by (i) repayment
of short term loans of US 0.01 million. 

Net cash flow generated from financing activities
amounted to US 0.9 million for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024. This was primarily attributable to (i) the proceeds from issuance
of ordinary shares for private placement of US 0.5 million, (ii) proceeds from short term loans of US 0.8 million; partially offset by
(i) repayment of short term loans of US 0.3 million. 

Capital Expenditures 

Our capital expenditures amounted to nil and US 0.1
million in for the three months ended of September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Our capital expenditures amounted to US 1.8 million
and US 4.1 million in for the nine months ended of September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. We will continue to make capital expenditures
to meet the expected growth of our business and expect that cash generated from our operating activities and financing activities will
meet our capital expenditure needs in the foreseeable future. 

Trend Information 

Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this report,
we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on
our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause the disclosed financial information to be
not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. 

JOBS Act 

Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that
an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
of new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves
of this extended transition period. 

31 

For as long as we remain an emerging growth
company under the recently enacted JOBS Act, we will, among other things: 

be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; 

be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and 

be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report on the financial statements. 

Although we are still evaluating the JOBS Act,
we currently intend to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us
so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, including the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public
accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control
over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you
with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers,
that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors
and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our common stock
may be materially and adversely affected. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

Information about market risks for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit
31 of this report, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, these officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to them in a manner that allows for
timely decisions regarding required disclosures and are effective in ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There were no changes
during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We may from time to time be subject to various
legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not, and none of our subsidiaries

a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and, insofar as we are aware, no such litigation,
arbitration or administrative proceedings are pending, threatened, or contemplated. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding,
regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, including our management s time
