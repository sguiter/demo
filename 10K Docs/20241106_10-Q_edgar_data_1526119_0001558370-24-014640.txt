 Verastem, Inc. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) million. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates operating losses may continue for the foreseeable future since the Company does not yet have regulatory approval to sell any of its product candidates, and the Company continues to incur operating costs to execute its strategic plan, including costs related to research and development of its product candidates and commercial readiness activities. As a result of the assessment in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months after the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company expects to finance its operations with its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, through potential future milestones and royalties received pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated August 10, 2020, between the Company and Secura (the Secura APA ), through the loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC Oxford ), or through other strategic financing opportunities that could include, but are not limited to collaboration agreements, future offerings of its equity, or the incurrence of debt. However, given the risks associated with these potential strategic or financing opportunities, they are not deemed probable for purposes of the going concern assessment. If the Company fails to obtain additional future capital, it may be unable to complete its planned preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain approval of certain investigational product candidates from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

 at a ratio of 1-for-12 (the Reverse Stock Split ), as authorized at the Company s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders held on May 15, 2023. The Company effected the Reverse Stock Split on May 31, 2023. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise were entitled to a fractional share of common stock were entitled to receive a price equal to the closing price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the date immediately preceding the Reverse Stock Split, as adjusted by the ratio of one share of common stock for every 12 shares of common stock, multiplied by the applicable fraction of a share. The number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue remains at shares and the par value of its common stock remains unchanged at per share. The Company has retroactively restated the share and per share amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable under all outstanding stock options, convertible notes and preferred stock. In addition, proportionate adjustments have been made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of the restricted stock units and the number of shares of common stock reserved for the Company s equity incentive compensation plans. The condensed consolidated statements of convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity reflect the impact of the Reverse Stock Split by reclassifying from common stock to additional paid-in capital in an amount equal to the par value of the decreased shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Short-term investments Total financial assets Preferred stock tranche liability The Company s cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of U.S. Government money market funds, corporate bonds, agency bonds and commercial paper of publicly traded companies. The investments and cash equivalents have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data.

In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company granted Oxford a security interest in all of the Company s personal property now owned or hereafter acquired, excluding intellectual property (but including the right to payments and proceeds of intellectual property), and a negative pledge on intellectual property. The Company assessed all terms and features of the Loan Agreement in order to identify any potential embedded features that would require bifurcation. As part of this analysis, the Company assessed the economic characteristics and risks of the Loan Agreement, including put and call features. The Company determined that all features of the Loan Agreement were clearly and closely associated with a debt host and did not require bifurcation as a derivative liability, or the fair value of the feature was immaterial to the Company's financial statements. The Company reassesses the features on a quarterly basis to determine if they require separate accounting. There have been no changes to the Company s assessment through September 30, 2024.

The exercise price of the New Options granted was per share, which was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the grant date of the New Options.

As a result of the Option Exchange Program, the Company will recognize incremental stock-based compensation expense of million over the requisite service period of the New Options, which is two or four years depending on whether the Exchanged Options were vested at the time of exchange. Since the Exchanged Options were not at-the-money on the modification date, the Company was precluded from utilizing the simplified method as described in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14.D.2 to calculate the expected term as a key assumption in the Black-Scholes pricing model. Therefore, the Company utilized the binomial lattice model to calculate the fair value of the Exchanged Options immediately prior to the exchange. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of the New Options on the modification date.

The Company concluded that the duvelisib global license and intellectual property were not distinct within the context of the contract (i.e. separately identifiable) because the other assets including certain existing duvelisib inventory, certain duvelisib contracts and clinical trials, certain regulatory approval, and certain regulatory documentation and books and records do not have stand-alone value from other duvelisib global license and intellectual property and Secura could not benefit from them without the duvelisib global license and intellectual property. Consistent with the guidance under ASC 606-10-25-16A, the Company disregarded immaterial promised goods and services when determining performance obligations. The Company has determined that the upfront payment of million, future potential milestone payments and royalties including from Secura s sublicensees should be allocated to the delivery of the Bundled Secura Performance Obligation. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, Secura achieved million of total worldwide net sales of COPIKTRA which triggered a million sales milestone payment to the Company under the Secura APA. The Company received the million milestone payment in July 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of sale of COPIKTRA license and related assets revenue within the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company determined all other future potential milestones and royalties were excluded from the transaction price, as all other milestone amounts were fully constrained under the guidance as of September 30, 2024. As part of the Company s evaluation of the constraint, the Company considered several factors in determining whether there is significant uncertainty associated with the future events that would result in the milestone payments. Those factors included: the likelihood and magnitude of revenue reversals related to future milestones, the amount of variable consideration that is highly susceptible to factors outside of the Company s influence and the uncertainty about the consideration is not expected to be resolved for an extended period of time. All future potential milestone payments were fully constrained as the risk of significant revenue reversal related to these amounts has not yet been resolved. t record a federal or state income tax provision or benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, due to the expected loss before income taxes to be incurred for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as the Company s continued maintenance of a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. other commitments other than minimum lease payments as disclosed in Note 8 .

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysi s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Please also refer to the sections under headings Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. OVERVIEW We are a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company, with an ongoing registration directed trial, committed to the development and commercialization of new medicines to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with cancer. Our pipeline is focused on RAS/ MAPK driven cancers, specifically novel drug candidates that inhibit signaling pathways critical to cancer cell survival and tumor growth, particularly RAF/MEK inhibition and FAK inhibition. Our most advanced product candidates, avutometinib and defactinib, are being investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including, but not limited to LGSOC, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, CRC, and thyroid cancer. We believe that avutometinib may be beneficial as a therapeutic as a single agent or when used together in combination with defactinib, other pathway inhibitors, or other current and emerging standard of care treatments in cancers that do not adequately respond to currently available therapies. Avutometinib is an orally available, first-in-class, small molecule RAF/MEK clamp that inhibits RAS/RAF/MEK, extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase ERK MAPK pathway which is involved in proliferation, migration, transformation, and survival of tumor cells. In contrast to other MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib is a dual RAF/MEK clamp that blocks MEK kinase activity and induces th e fo rmation of dominant negative RAF-MEK complexes preventing phosphorylation of MEK by A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase ARAF ), B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase BRAF and C-raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase CRAF ). MEK-only inhibitors (e.g. trametinib) may have limited efficacy because they induce MEK phosphorylation pMEK by relieving dependent feed back inhibition of RAF. By inhibiting RAF-mediated phosphorylation of MEK, avutometinib has the potential advantage of not inducing pMEK. This unique mechanism of avutometinib enables it to inhibit ERK signaling more effectively and may confer enhanced therapeutic activity against MAPK pathway-driven cancers. We use the term RAMP to refer to our RAF and MEK Program. Avutometinib inhibits MAPK pathway signaling and proliferation of tumor cell lines harboring MAPK pathway alterations including KRAS, neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog NRAS ), and BRAF mutations, among others. Avutometinib has demonstrated strong antitumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with (i) agents targeting parallel pathways (e.g. inhibitors of FAK, CDK4/6 and mTOR), (ii) agents targeting other nodes in the MAPK pathway (e.g. anti-EGFR, SOS1, KRAS G12C, and KRAS G12D inhibitors), (iii) chemotherapy, and (iv) anti-PD-1. Defactinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of FAK and proline-rich tyrosine kinase PYK2 that is currently being evaluated as a potential combination therapy for various solid tumors. FAK and PYK2 are members of the same family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases that integrate signals from integrin and growth factor receptors to regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion. Defactinib disrupts malignant cells both directly and through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical research by our scientists and collaborators indicates that FAK inhibition delays tumor progression in cancer models, which was associated with reduced stromal density and immunosuppressive cell populations. Furthermore, activation of FAK is a putative adaptive resistance mechanism to MAPK pathway inhibition, supporting the clinical evaluation of avutometinib in combination with defactinib for treatment of cancers harboring MAPK pathway alterations.

 The combination of avutometinib and defactinib is clinically active in patients with KRAS mutant KRAS mt and KRAS wild-type KRAS wt recurrent LGSOC and has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC, regardless of KRAS status, after one or more prior lines of therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy. Avutometinib, alone or in combination with defactinib, has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of all patients with LGSOC in the United States. Defactinib has received orphan drug designation in ovarian cancer in the United States, the European Union, and Australia. In addition, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to avutometinib, in combination with defactinib, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced a registration-directed trial, known as the RAMP 201 study, investigating avutometinib as a monotherapy and in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC. The RAMP 201 study is an adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. The combination of avutometinib and defactinib has been declared the go-forward treatment regimen based on a higher rate of confirmed objective responses in a planned interim analysis with prespecified criteria, acknowledging the demonstrated contribution of defactinib. In October 2024, we announced updated results from the RAMP 201 study with a data cutoff of June 30, 2024. The primary analysis of RAMP 201 study showed a confirmed overall response rate ORR by blinded independent central review of 31 (34/109; 95 CI: 23-41) in all evaluable patients with measurable disease with approximately 12 months of follow up. Among patients with KRAS mt LGSOC, the confirmed ORR was 44 (25/57; 95 CI: 31-58) and for patients with KRAS wt LGSOC the confirmed ORR was 17 (9/52; 95 CI: 8-30). The median duration of response was 31.1 months (95 CI: 14.8-31.1) in all evaluable patients, with 31.1 months (95 CI: 14.8-31.1) in the KRAS mt population and 9.2 months (95 CI: 5.5-NEi) in the KRAS wt population. The median progression-free survival was 12.9 months (95 CI: 10.9-20.2) in all evaluable patients, with 22 months (95 CI: 11.1-36.6) in the KRAS mt population and 12.8 months (95 CI: 7.4-18.4) in the KRAS wt population. The disease control rate at six or more months was 61 in the total evaluable population, 70 in KRAS mt population and 50 in KRAS wt population. The updated data continues to demonstrate avutometinib in combination with defactinib is generally well-tolerated, with a 10 discontinuation rate due to adverse events and no new safety signals were identified. The most common treatment-related adverse events (all grades, grade 3) for the combination were nausea (67.0 , 2.6 ), diarrhea (58.3 , 7.8 ), and increased blood creatine phosphokinase levels (60.0 , 24.3 ). In October 2024, we announced that a Type A meeting was held with the FDA during which we aligned with the FDA on our plans to complete our NDA submission for the combination of avutometinib and defactinib in October 2024 for adult patients with recurrent KRAS mt LGSOC, who received at least one prior systemic therapy, based on mature data from the RAMP 201 study. Subsequently in October 2024, we completed our NDA submission with the FDA for the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib for adults with recurrent KRAS mt LGSOC, who received at least one prior systemic therapy. We submitted the NDA under the FDA s Accelerated Approval pathway and requested a Priority Review based on the combination s potential to address significant unmet medical need among patients with recurrent LGSOC. If granted, the FDA review will be completed within six months following the 60-day filing period. If approved, we expect that avutometinib plus defactinib will be the first-ever FDA-approved treatment specifically for adult patients in the United States with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC. At this time, the FDA did not recommend pursuing accelerated approval of a KRAS wt indication. This strategic approach allows us to potentially reach the market more efficiently while mapping out a path forward with the FDA for the KRAS wt indication, including leveraging data from the ongoing RAMP 301 Phase 3 study. RAMP 301, which is currently enrolling patients with recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS mutation status, will serve as a confirmatory study for the initial indication and has potential to expand the indication regardless of KRAS mutation status. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive, and uncertain process and the FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application, including requests such as ours for accelerated approval and priority review, or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies. While we have engaged in discussions with the FDA with respect to the scope and nature of our NDA submission, the FDA may, for example, require additional data under the RAMP 301 study before approving the NDA for the scope we request, or at all. There can be no assurance regarding the timing and outcome of the FDA review and approval of our NDA submission.

 We estimate the total annual incident addressable market opportunity for the combination of avutometinib and defactinib to be approximately 300 million for KRAS mt and approximately 374 million for KRAS wt populations. We estimate the total prevalent addressable market opportunity to be approximately 1.7 billion for KRAS mt and approximately 1.6 billion for KRAS wt populations, respectively. Our estimates of the patient population, pricing and revenue opportunities for its product candidates, including for KRAS mt and KRAS wt patients with LGSOC, are based on several internal and third-party estimates and assumptions, including, without limitation, internal forecasts, the median duration of treatment from initial interim clinical data and the assumed prices at which we can commercialize our product candidates. Specifically, our estimates of total addressable market opportunities are based on: (a) estimated annual incidence of KRAS mt and KRAS wt populations of approximately 500 and 1,000 patients, respectively, (b) estimated prevalence of KRAS mt and KRAS wt populations of approximately 2,800 and 4,200 patients, respectively, (c) the average duration of therapy as observed in Verastem clinical trials of 18 months and 11 months for KRAS mt and KRAS wt populations, respectively, and (d) an estimated cost of therapy of 34,000 per month consistent with other recent oncology drug launches. The average duration of therapy included in this calculation is based, in part, on the estimated duration of therapy for patients dosed with the combination of avutometinib and defactinib for the combined Parts A, B, and C in RAMP 201 as of the data cutoff as of June 30, 2024. Amongst 115 patients, 58 enrolled with KRAS mutated LGSOC and 57 had wild-type, or non-mutated, KRAS. The estimated mean duration of therapy for all patients is 14.5 months. For KRAS mt, the estimated mean duration of therapy is 18.3 months and for KRAS wt, the estimated mean duration of therapy is 10.7 months. Estimated mean duration of therapy was calculated by projecting complete time on treatment for patients still on treatment by sampling from an exponential distribution conditional on the observed duration through the cutoff date. In December 2023, we announced initiation of a Phase 3 trial, known as the RAMP 301 study, to evaluate the combination of avutometinib and defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC. The RAMP 301 study is a randomized global trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of avutometinib and defactinib versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy in patients with recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 301 is intended to serve as the confirmatory study required by the FDA to potentially convert an accelerated approval for the combination of avutometinib and defactinib for the treatment of LGSOC to full approval. We also intend to initiate discussions with global regulatory authorities, including those in Europe and Japan, to determine the regulatory path with the objective of ultimately seeking approval for the combination in additional regions. For RAMP 301, we are currently enrolling patients with LGSOC regardless of KRAS mutation status across the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, and Australia, and we plan to complete enrollment by the end of 2025. In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen, Inc. Amgen to evaluate the combination of avutometinib with Amgen s KRAS G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 study entitled RAMP 203. The Phase 1/2 trial began evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with LUMAKRAS in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor, as well as in patients who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The trial built upon initial preclinical data showing enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination of LUMAKRAS (KRAS G12C inhibition) and avutometinib (RAF/MEK inhibition) relative to either agent alone. In October 2023, we announced initial safety and pharmacokinetics results, as well as preliminary efficacy results, from the RAMP 203 study which were presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in October 2023. These preliminary results showed a confirmed ORR of 25 (3/12) across efficacy-evaluable patients and seen in both KRAS G12C inhibitor resistant (14.3 ; 1/7) and na ve (40 ; 2/5) patients. In January 2024, the FDA granted fast track designation for combination of avutometinib and LUMAKRAS for the treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-mutant metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy and have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The RAMP 203 study has progressed to the recommended Phase 2 dose of 4 mg avutometinib in combination with 960 mg of LUMAKRAS for the doublet of avutometinib and LUMAKRAS. RAMP 203 is currently enrolling patients who have experienced disease progression on a KRAS G12C inhibitor in the dose expansion phase (Part B) and completed enrollment of patients without prior G12C treatment to the initial doublet dose expansion phase. Based on emerging data demonstrating improved tumor regressions in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC preclinical models when a FAK inhibitor is combined with a G12C inhibitor and avutometinib, defactinib was

Table of Contents 
 added to the RAMP 203 study in new triplet cohorts in 2024. We expect to report updated interim data from the doublet combination of avutometinib plus LUMAKRAS and provide initial safety data and a status of enrollment for the triplet combination of avutometinib, LUMAKRAS and defactinib by the end of 2024. In November 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. Mirati to evaluate the combination of avutometinib with Mirati s KRAS G12C inhibitor KRAZATI (adagrasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 204. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with KRAZATI in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The trial will build on preclinical data showing a deeper blockade of MAPK pathway signaling resulting in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination of KRAZATI (KRAS G12C inhibition) and avutometinib (RAF/MEK inhibition) relative to either agent alone. In the fourth quarter of 2024, after discussion with Bristol Myers Squibb Company, who completed an acquisition of Mirati in the first quarter of 2024, and the RAMP 204 steering committee, we decided to close the RAMP 204 study to further enrollment in order to prioritize the RAMP 203 study. No new safety signals were identified in the RAMP 204 study and closure to further enrollment is not related to safety findings. The RAMP 203 study will be prioritized primarily because it covers both patients who are G12Ci treatment na ve and progressed and importantly includes the triplet treatment approach. In May 2022, we received the first Therapeutic Accelerator Award from PanCAN for up to 3.8 million. The grant is supporting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib entitled RAMP 205. RAMP 205 is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with GEMZAR (gemcitabine) and ABRAXANE (Nab-paclitaxel) in patients with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The RAMP 205 trial is evaluating whether combining avutometinib (to target mutant KRAS which is mutated in more than 90 of pancreatic adenocarcinomas) and defactinib (to reduce stromal density and adaptive resistance to avutometinib) to the standard GEMZAR/ABRAXANE regimen improves outcomes for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In August 2022, PanCAN agreed to provide us with an additional 0.5 million for the collection and translational analysis of patient samples. The RAMP 205 trial is open and enrolling. Combination dose evaluation is ongoing. As of a data cut of May 14, 2024, we reported patients receiving the combination of avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel in dose level 1 cohort achieved a confirmed ORR of 83 (5/6), one dose-limiting toxicity was observed in the dose level 1 cohort, and the dose level was subsequently cleared after additional patients were enrolled. The initial interim results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2024. We expect to report updated data from RAMP 205 study in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, avutometinib and defactinib are currently being investigated in combination with immunotherapeutic and other agents through investigator sponsored trials ISTs for the treatment of various solid tumors, including, but not limited to, CRC, gynecological cancer with MAPK pathway alterations, breast cancer, thyroid cancer and melanoma . In August 2023, we entered into a collaboration and option agreement (the GenFleet Agreement with GenFleet pursuant to which GenFleet granted us options to obtain exclusive development and commercialization rights worldwide outside of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (the GenFleet Territory for up to three oncology programs targeting RAS pathway driven cancers (the GenFleet Options . We may exercise our GenFleet Options on a program-by-program basis. The collaboration builds on the strengths of both companies in oncology small molecule drug development, enabling us to partner our clinical development and regulatory expertise with GenFleet s accomplished discovery capabilities. This synergistic collaboration includes our experience and established network of collaborators, including scientific and clinical experts in RAS biology and RAS pathway-driven cancers and GenFleet s accomplishments with its KRAS G12C inhibitor program. In December 2023, we announced the selection of an orally bioavailable, potent and selective small molecule KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor entitled VS-7375/GFH375 with a potential best-in-class profile as the lead program from our collaboration with GenFleet. An investigational new drug IND application by GenFleet in China for VS-7375/GFH375, was cleared in June 2024, following which GenFleet initiated a Phase 1/2 study in solid tumors with KRAS G12D mutation for VS-7375/GFH375 in China in June 2024. GenFleet has dosed several patients in the Phase/12 study in China evaluating VS-7375/GFH375 in patients with KRAS G12D-mutated advanced solid tumors which started in July 2024. The Phase 1 study is being conducted in approximately 20 hospitals in China and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VS-7375/GFH375 in patients with advanced KRAS G12D mutant solid tumors. The Phase 1 study will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and then 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 further evaluate in Phase 2 the efficacy and safety of VS-7375/GFH375 in patients with advanced solid tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. After evaluating initial dose escalation data from the Phase 1 study in China, we anticipate filing an IND in the United States by first quarter of 2025. Our operations to date have been organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, identifying and acquiring potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates and initiating U.S. commercial operations following the approval of COPIKTRA through our ownership period ending in September 2020. We have financed our operations to date primarily through public offerings of our common stock, pre-funded warrants, and warrants, offerings of convertible notes, sales of common stock under our at-the-market equity offering programs, our loan and security agreement executed with Hercules in March 2017, as amended, the upfront payments and milestone payments under our license and collaboration agreements with Sanofi, CSPC , and Yakult, the upfront payment and milestone payments received under the Secura APA, the proceeds in connection with the private investment in public equity (the PIPE ), and our Loan Agreement with Oxford, sales of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Additionally, from our U.S. commercial launch of COPIKTRA on September 24, 2018, through our ownership period ending in September 2020, we financed a portion of our operations through product revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 891.0 million. Our net loss was 24.0 million, 66.1 million, 20.0 million and 60.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 113.2 million. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. We anticipate operating losses may continue for the foreseeable future since we do not yet have regulatory approval to sell any of our product candidates, and we continue to incur operating costs to execute our strategic plan, including costs related to research and development of our product candidates and commercial readiness activities. As a result of the assessment in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months after the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. We expect to finance our operations with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, through potential future milestones and royalties received pursuant to the Secura APA, through the Loan Agreement with Oxford, or through other strategic financing opportunities that could include, but are not limited to collaboration agreements, future offerings of our equity, or the incurrence of debt. However, given the risk associated with these potential strategic or financing opportunities, they are not deemed probable for purposes of the going concern assessment. If we fail to obtain additional future capital, we may be unable to complete our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain approval of certain investigational product candidates from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used, which would have resulted in different financial results. The critical accounting policies we identified in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, related to revenue recognition, collaborative agreements, accrued and prepaid research and development expenses, and stock-based compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies.

We expect to finance a portion of our business through future potential milestones and royalties received pursuant to the Secura APA.

We primarily invest our cash, cash equivalents and investments in U.S. Government money market funds, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds and commercial paper of publicly traded companies. Risks and uncertainties include those identified under Item 1A. Risk Factors , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024, and under Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Cash flows The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for the 2024 Quarter and the 2023 Quarter (in thousands): 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (79,672) (56,779) Investing activities 59,972 (56,883) Financing activities 54,040 134,640 Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 34,340 20,978 Operating activities.

The cash provided by investing activities for the 2023 Period relates to the net purchases of investments of 56.9 million . Financing activities. The cash provided by financing activities for the 2024 Period represents 53.8 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants, and warrants as part of the July 2024 Offering, 1.3 million of proceeds received from insurance premium financing and 0.2 million of proceeds received from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by 1.2 million of

Table of Contents 
 payments on insurance premium financing, and 0.2 million of fees paid to the Lenders to amend our Loan Agreement with Oxford. Th e cash provided by financing activities for the 2023 Period primarily represents 91.4 million of proceeds from our public offering in June 2023 of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, net of issuance costs, 28.1 million of proceeds received from issuance of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, 14.9 million of proceeds received pursuant to the Loan Agreement, 1.4 million of proceeds received from insurance premium financing and 0.1 million of proceeds received related to our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by 1.3 million of payments on insurance premium financing. Refer to Note 9. Notes Payable to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report for additional details on the finance agreement with AFCO related to insurance premium financing and the monthly payments of principal and interest related thereto; Note 7. Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report for additional details on the Loan Agreement; and Note 10. Capital Stock to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report for additional details on the July 2024 Offering of common stock, pre-funded warrants, and warrants, June 2023 Offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and the January 2023 offering of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The disclosure of our contractual obligations and commitments was reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as previously disclosed in the Company s subsequent filings with the SEC, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have not been any material changes from the contractual obligations and commitments previously disclosed in such report. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Ris k. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 113.2 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of cash, U.S. Government money market funds, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds and commercial paper of publicly traded companies. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because most of our investments are interest bearing. Our available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. Due to the short-term duration of most of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We contract with CROs and contract manufacturers globally which may be denominated in foreign currencies. We may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. As of June 30, an immaterial amount of our total liabilities were denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of September 30, 2024, we have borrowed 40.0 million under the Loan Agreement. The Term Loans under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to (a) the greater of (i) the one-month CME Secured Overnight Financing Rate and (ii) 0.13 plus (b) 7.37 , which is subject to an overall floor and cap . Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate under the Loan Agreement. A 10 increase in current interest rates would have resulted in an immaterial increase in the amount of cash interest expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 due to the overall interest rate floor and cap. Item 4. Controls and Procedure s. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 99.1 
 Verastem Oncology Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results and Highlights Recent Business Updates Completed rolling NDA submission for avutometinib and defactinib combination in recurrent KRAS mutant low-grade serous ovarian cancer in October 2024 Company seeking accelerated approval and priority review of its NDA submission for patients with KRAS mutant low-grade serous ovarian cancer; FDA filing decision expected before the end of 2024 with potential for FDA approval decision by mid-2025 Preparations for a potential U.S. commercial launch in mid-2025 are ongoing Presented positive, updated safety and efficacy results from the RAMP 201 trial at the IGCS 2024 Annual Meeting in October 2024 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 6, 2024--Verastem Oncology (Nasdaq: VSTM), a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing new medicines for patients with cancer, today announced business updates and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we made advancements in our recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer program, including sharing updated Phase 2 RAMP 201 data demonstrating robust and durable response rates, tumor reductions across a majority of patients regardless of their KRAS mutation status, and low discontinuation rates due to adverse events. We also completed our rolling NDA submission for recurrent KRAS mutant low-grade serous ovarian cancer and strengthened our balance sheet, said Dan Paterson, president and chief executive officer of Verastem Oncology. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate an FDA decision on the acceptance of our NDA, plan to submit our updated RAMP 201 trial data for publication and expect to prepare a U.S. IND application for VS-7375, an oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor. Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Updates Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination in Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC) Completed the rolling New Drug Application (NDA) submission for the combination of avutometinib and defactinib for adult patients with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC, who received at least one prior systemic therapy, in October 2024. The Company submitted the NDA under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Accelerated Approval pathway and requested Priority Review b ased on the combination s potential to address significant unmet medical need among patients with recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 301, which is currently enrolling patients with recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS mutation status across the U.S., UK, EU, Canada, and Australia, will serve as a confirmatory study for the initial indication and has potential to expand the indication regardless of KRAS mutation status. The Company plans to complete enrollment in RAMP 301 by the end of 2025. The Company plans to map 

out a path forward with the FDA for the KRAS wild-type indication, including the ability to leverage data from the ongoing RAMP 301 Phase 3 trial. Announced mature data from the RAMP 201 trial that continued to show robust and durable response rates with low discontinuation rates due to adverse events in patients with recurrent KRAS mutant or KRAS wild-type LGSOC who had a minimum follow-up of 12 months, at the International Gynecologic Cancer Society (IGCS) 2024 Annual Meeting on October 17, 2024. The primary analysis of the RAMP 201 trial, with a data cutoff of June 30, 2024, showed a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) of 31 (34/109; 95 CI: 23-41), 44 (25/57; 95 CI: 31-58) in KRAS mutant LGSOC, and 17 (9/52; 95 CI: 8-30) in KRAS wild-type LGSOC. The majority (82 of all patients had a reduction in their tumors, regardless of KRAS status. The updated data continue to demonstrate avutometinib in combination with defactinib is generally well-tolerated, with a 10 discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) and no new safety signals. The Company continued its commercial preparation activities for a potential U.S. launch in mid-2025. The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 Verastem sponsored clinical trial, called RAMP201J, evaluating the safety and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with defactinib for recurrent LGSOC in Japan in October 2024. Avutometinib in Combination with KRAS G12C Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Following a thorough evaluation of the Company s lung cancer clinical development program, Verastem has decided to discontinue the Phase 1/2 RAMP 204 clinical trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and adagrasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. There are no safety concerns with the RAMP 204 trial. The Company is prioritizing the Phase 1/2 RAMP 203 clinical trial, which is evaluating the doublet of avutometinib and sotorasib and the triplet combination of avutometinib and sotorasib plus defactinib in similar patient populations. Since the last update of RAMP 203 in October of 2023, enrollment to the doublet of avutometinib plus sotorasib for the KRAS G12C inhibitor na ve Stage I Part B cohort has recently completed, and per protocol patients are being followed to determine if the efficacy supports further expanded enrollment into Stage II. The KRAS G12C inhibitor prior-treated Stage I Part B cohort enrollment is nearly complete. Earlier this year, RAMP 203 was modified to include the triplet combination of avutometinib and sotorasib plus defactinib and the first safety cohort of this triplet has been fully enrolled. Preclinical data provide strong evidence that addition of a FAK inhibitor to the sotorasib and avutometinib doublet has the potential to deepen anti-tumor response and significantly delay tumor progression. Expect to report updated interim data from the doublet combination of avutometinib plus sotorasib and provide initial safety data and a status of enrollment for the triplet combination of avutometinib, sotorasib and defactinib in the RAMP 203 trial by the end of 2024. Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination in First-Line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Preclinical data outlining the scientific rationale for the combination of avutometinib plus defactinib with standard of care chemotherapy was published in the October 23, 2024 edition of Science Translational Medicine . Presented initial interim safety and efficacy results from the ongoing RAMP 205 trial of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with current standard of care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in first- 

line metastatic pancreatic cancer on June 1, 2024, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Expect to report updated data from the ongoing RAMP 205 trial in Q1 2025. VS-7375/GFH375: Oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) Inhibitor GenFleet began dosing several patients in the Phase 1/2 trial in China evaluating VS-7375/GFH375 in patients with KRAS G12D-mutated advanced solid tumors in July 2024. After evaluating initial dose escalation data from the Phase 1 study of VS-7375/GFH375 in China, Verastem anticipates filing a U.S. investigational new drug (IND) application by Q1 2025 . Discovery/lead optimization continues for the second and third programs in the GenFleet collaboration. Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Verastem Oncology ended the third quarter of 2024 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 113.2 million which provides an expected cash runway through the potential approval of avutometinib and defactinib for recurrent LGSOC in mid-2025. Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Quarter were 37.0 million, compared to 21.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Quarter ). Research development expenses for the 2024 Quarter were 24.8 million, compared to 13.9 million for the 2023 Quarter. The increase of 10.9 million, or 78.4 , was primarily related to contract research organization costs, consulting costs, investigator fees associated with ensuring continued rapid start-up of RAMP 301, and a clinical milestone expense that was reached in the GenFleet G12D program. Selling, general administrative expenses for the 2024 Quarter were 12.3 million, compared to 7.4 million for the 2023 Quarter. The increase of 4.9 million, or 66.2 , was primarily related to a one-time cost associated with July 2024 financing activities, personnel costs, including non-cash stock compensation and additional costs in anticipation of a potential launch of avutometinib and defactinib in LGSOC. Net loss for the 2024 Quarter was 24.0 million, or 0.60 per share (basic and diluted), compared to 20.0 million, or 0.75 per share (basic and diluted) for the 2023 Quarter. For the 2024 Quarter, non-GAAP adjusted net loss was 35.3 million, or 0.88 per share (diluted) compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of 19.0 million, or 0.71 per share (diluted) for the 2023 Quarter. Please refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation attached to this press release. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement Verastem Oncology s condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain amounts or expenses from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. 

Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with the Company s GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency and period-over- period comparability with respect to the Company s operating performance and can enhance investors ability to identify operating trends in the Company s business. Management uses these measures, among other factors, to assess and analyze operational results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the Company s operating results as reported under GAAP, not in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are included in the tables accompanying this press release after the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. About the Avutometinib and Defactinib Combination Avutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that induces inactive complexes of MEK with ARAF, BRAF and CRAF potentially creating a more complete and durable anti-tumor response through maximal RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition. In contrast to currently available MEK-only inhibitors, avutometinib blocks both MEK kinase activity and the ability of RAF to phosphorylate MEK. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of other MEK-only inhibitors. Verastem Oncology is currently conducting clinical trials with avutometinib in RAS/MAPK driven tumors as part of its R af A nd M ek P rogram or RAMP. Verastem is currently enrolling patients and activating sites for RAMP 301 (NCT06072781) an international Phase 3 confirmatory trial evaluating the combination of avutometinib and defactinib, a selective FAK inhibitor, versus standard chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for the treatment of recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). RAMP 201 (NCT04625270) is a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC and enrollment has been completed for the RAMP 201 trial. Verastem has completed its submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib in adults with recurrent KRAS mutant LGSOC who received at least one prior systemic therapy in October 2024, with a potential FDA decision mid-2025. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation of the investigational combination of avutometinib and defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Avutometinib alone or in combination with defactinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of LGSOC. Verastem Oncology has established a clinical collaboration with Amgen to evaluate LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib in both treatment naive and in patients who progressed on a G12C inhibitor as part of the RAMP 203 trial (NCT05074810). Verastem has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the triplet combination in April 2024. RAMP 205 (NCT05669482), a 

Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating avutometinib and defactinib with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in patients with front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, is supported by the PanCAN Therapeutic Accelerator Award. FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to avutometinib and defactinib combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. About VS-7375/GFH375 VS-7375/GFH375 is a potential best-in-class, potent and selective oral KRAS G12D (ON/OFF) inhibitor, identified as the lead discovery program from the Verastem Oncology discovery and development collaboration with GenFleet Therapeutics. GenFleet s IND for VS-7375/GFH375 was approved in China in June 2024 and the Phase 1/2 trial in KRAS G12D-mutant solid tumors was subsequently initiated and the first patient was dosed in July 2024. The collaboration includes three discovery programs, the first being the KRAS G12D inhibitor, and provides Verastem Oncology with exclusive options to license three compounds selected for collaboration after successful completion of pre-determined milestones in Phase 1 trials. The licenses would give Verastem Oncology development and commercialization rights outside of the GenFleet territories of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
