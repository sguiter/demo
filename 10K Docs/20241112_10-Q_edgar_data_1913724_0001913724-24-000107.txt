 Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is entitled to an incentive fee Incentive Fee ), which consists of components; an incentive fee based on income and an incentive fee based on capital gains. 
 The portion based on the Company s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement entered into between the Company and the Administrator, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees). 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount OID ), debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of per quarter annualized). 
 The Company will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) (the hurdle rate or Hurdle 
 of the dollar amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle but is less than a rate of return of annualized). The Company refers to this portion of its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and of the dollar amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the Hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 
 These calculations are pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under our DRIP. The distribution and servicing plan adopted in compliance with Rule 12b-1 is a compensation plan, which means that the Intermediary Manager is compensated regardless of its expenses, as opposed to a reimbursement plan which reimburses only for

 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 The Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser on October 25, 2022. The Adviser may elect to pay certain expenses (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest or distributions and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 
 Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), the Company shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment . Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 
 
 No Reimbursement Payment for any month will be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (as defined below) declared by the Company at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) the Operating Expense Ratio (as defined below) at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365 day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to Adviser, and interest expense, by net assets. 
 
 The Company s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such Expense Payments were made by the Adviser.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 
 The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it reinvests all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of our Company s distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 The Company has implemented a share repurchase program under which, at the discretion of the Board, the Company may repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the NAV of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, such target amount is assessed each calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time (including to offer to purchase fewer shares) if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or may only be available in an amount less than of our Common Shares outstanding. 
 
 The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

 Character of Distributions 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment.

 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive per share in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Company paid cash consideration in connection with the AGTB Transaction of approximately million and had transaction costs of approximately million. The Company acquired million of investments at amortized cost and fair value, with million in other assets net of other liabilities. 
 
 The AGTB Transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of AGTB by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50, Business Combinations-Related Issues, with the fair value of total consideration paid and transaction costs allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of the AGTB Transaction. Generally, under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. The cost of the group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than certain non-qualifying assets (for example cash) and does not give rise to goodwill.

TPG (Nasdaq: TPG), a leading global alternative investment firm. Our Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. We also intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code.

 On November 1, 2023, TPG completed the previously announced acquisition of TPG Angelo Gordon pursuant to which TPG Angelo Gordon, including our Adviser (which also serves as our Administrator), became indirect subsidiaries of TPG. In connection with the closing of the TPG Transaction, on November 1, 2023, the Company entered into an amended and restated investment management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement with the Adviser. Under applicable law, the TPG Transaction resulted in an assignment and automatic termination of the prior amended and restated investment management agreement (the Prior Investment Management Agreement ). Our shareholders approved the Investment Management Agreement at a special meeting of our shareholders held on September 26, 2023. All material terms in the Investment Management Agreement are unchanged from the Prior Investment Management Agreement. 
 
 On September 25, 2024, our board of trustees (the Board adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the Fourth A R Declaration of Trust in order to reflect the change of the Company s name from AG Twin Brook Capital Income Fund to TPG Twin Brook Capital Income Fund . Further, to reflect the new name of the Company, on September 25, 2024, the Board adopted the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Third A R Bylaws ), effective the same day. 
 
 Pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement, subject to the overall supervision of the Board, our Adviser manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. Our Adviser is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments, and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. 
 Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, general counsel and their respective staffs. 
 As a BDC, we must invest at least 70 of our assets in eligible portfolio companies, generally, U.S. private operating companies (or small U.S. public operating companies with a market capitalization of less than 250 million). As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30 of our portfolio in non-eligible portfolio company investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies, which may include investments in a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC ). Because we have elected to be regulated as a BDC, and we intend to continue to qualify as a RIC under the Code, our portfolio will also be subject to the diversification and other requirements under the Code. 
 
 Investments 
 We invest principally in privately originated senior secured loans to U.S. middle market companies, which we believe have consistent capital needs and have not only been underserved in recent years by traditional providers of capital such as banks and the public debt markets, but also for a variety of reasons may prefer working with experienced non-bank lenders. Our origination strategy focuses on the middle market private equity community. This financing is utilized for a variety of purposes, including to fund organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, management buyouts and leveraged buyouts for companies with revenue generally under 500 million. In describing our business, we generally use the term middle market to refer to companies with EBITDA of between 3 million and 50 million annually; however, we typically invest in companies with EBITDA of less than 25 million. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser may determine whether companies qualify as middle market in its sole discretion, and we may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. 
 By investing predominantly in senior secured debt, we expect to reduce our risk of principal loss and deliver more stable returns over time as compared with investments in bonds, unsecured loans, mezzanine investments and public, private and project equity. However, we may also invest opportunistically in other parts of the capital structure, including senior secured stretch and unitranche facilities, second lien loans, mezzanine and mezzanine-related loans, and equity investments, as well as select other subordinated instruments either directly or through acquisitions in the secondary market. 
 The level of our investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to prospective portfolio companies, the level of merger, acquisition and refinancing activity for such companies, the availability of credit to finance transactions, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.

Because we have elected to be regulated as a BDC, and we intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code, our portfolio will also be subject to the diversification and other requirements under the Code. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other TPG Angelo Gordon funds. From time to time, we may co-invest with other TPG Angelo Gordon funds. 
 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily through the receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from various loan origination and other fees and from dividends on direct equity investments. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, administration, amendment, and loan servicing fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized as part of the underlying cost of the investments and accreted or amortized over the life of the investment as interest income. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Our debt investment portfolio consists of primarily floating rate loans. As of September 30, 2024, 99.9 of our debt investments, based on fair value, bore interest at floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset periodically to the applicable floor, only if the floor exceeds the index. Trends in base interest rates, such as Term SOFR, may affect our net investment income over the long term. In addition, our results may vary from period to period depending on the interest rates of new investments made during the period compared to investments that were sold or repaid during the period; these results reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macroeconomic trends. 
 Dividend income that we receive from our ownership of private securities is recorded pursuant to the terms of the respective investments. 
 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to the Adviser under the Investment Management Agreement, our allocable portion of expenses under the Administration Agreement, interest expense related to borrowings outstanding, and other operating costs described below.

All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses described above. 
 
 Leverage 
 In accordance with the 1940 Act, we can borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150 after such borrowings, subject to certain limitations. As market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, we currently estimate that our portfolio will be approximately 1.00-1.10x levered consistent with our target leverage profile of 0.90x 1.25x. We may from time to time increase the size of our existing credit facilities, enter into new credit facilities or issue new debt securities. Any such incurrence would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.

 The weighted average yield of our funded debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates of each investment as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. 
 Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 
 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of A to F. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 Investment Rating Description A A loan supported by exceptional financial strength, stability and liquidity; B As a general rule, a new transaction will be risk rated a B loan. Overtime, a B loan is supported by good financial strength, stability and liquidity; C A loan that is exhibiting deteriorating trends, which if not corrected could jeopardize repayment of the debt. In general, a default by the borrower of one of its financial performance covenants (leverage or coverage ratios) would warrant a downgrade of a loan to a risk rating of C D A loan that has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt or the ongoing enterprise value of the borrower; E A loan that has an uncured payment default; and F An asset that is considered uncollectible or of such little value that its continuance as a booked asset is unwarranted. 
 Our Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated C through F, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.

The Merger with AGTB Private BDC 
 
 On January 1, 2023, we completed the merger (the Merger with AGTB Private BDC Private BDC ), with TCAP continuing as the surviving company and Private BDC continuing as the accounting survivor. Therefore, all comparative consolidated financial statements prior to the Merger are those of the Private BDC. 
 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, TCAP and Private BDC caused the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2022. The Merger became effective on January 1, 2023 (the Effective Time ), as agreed to by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger. At the Effective Time, common shares of beneficial interest, par value 0.001 per share, of Private BDC outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were converted into a number of Class I shares of beneficial interest, par value 0.001 per share, of TCAP (the TCAP Common Shares equal to a ratio of one to one. As a result, we issued an aggregate of approximately 20.9 million TCAP Common Shares to former Private BDC shareholders. The TCAP Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time remained outstanding upon the Effective Time and were unaffected by the Merger. As a result, immediately following the Merger, we had approximately 20,945,030 Class I shares outstanding, and no Class S or D shares outstanding. 
 
 The Merger with AG Twin Brook BDC, Inc. 
 
 On July 28, 2023, we completed the previously announced acquisition of AG Twin Brook BDC, Inc., a Delaware corporation AGTB via merger, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. As of the effective time, each share of AGTB s common stock, par value 0.001 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive 20.00 per share in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. We paid cash consideration in connection with the AGTB Transaction of approximately 193 million and had transaction 
 100 

Table of Contents 

 costs of approximately 0.8 million. We acquired 186 million of investments at amortized cost and fair value, with 7 million in other assets net of other liabilities. 
 
 The AGTB Transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of AGTB by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50, Business Combinations-Related Issues, with the fair value of total consideration paid and transaction costs allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of the AGTB Transaction. Generally, under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. The cost of the group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than certain non-qualifying assets (for example cash) and does not give rise to goodwill. 
 
 Immediately following the AGTB Transaction, the investments were marked to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium (transaction costs) allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan as an offset to interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized appreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. 
 
 The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the AGTB Transaction:

Table of Contents 

 We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To continue to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not accrue U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 We conduct certain activities through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Twin Brook Equity XVIII Corp., and Twin Brook Equity XXXIII Corp., both of which are Delaware corporations. They are treated as corporations for United States federal income tax purposes and are subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued 2,000 current federal tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company accrued approximately 337,000, 553,000 , 37,000 and 961,000, respectively, of deferred federal tax related to the corporations, which is included in deferred federal tax provision on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investment Transactions 
 We fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net unrealized gains (losses) on our investment transactions were as follows: 
 (Amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Investments 1349 (1,462) 1,352 2902 Interest rate swaps (1,387) (1,387) Foreign currency forward contracts (4) 9 33 9 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investment transactions (42) (1,453) (2) 2,911 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net unrealized gains from investments were primarily driven by changes in market conditions since June 30, 2024.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous offering of common shares, cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, and credit facilities. The primary uses of our cash are (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser and Administrator or its affiliates), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 We may from time to time increase the size of our existing credit facilities. Any such incurrence would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, we currently estimate that our portfolio will be approximately 1.00-1.10x levered consistent with our target leverage profile of 0.90x 1.25x. There were 1,460.8 million outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 Cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our available debt capacity of 534.4 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had 102.1 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we used 1,270.3 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of 1,655.7 million and partially offset by other operating activities of 385.3 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,309.7 million during the period, primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common shares and debt borrowings. 
 Equity 
 At the Effective Time of the Merger, common shares of beneficial interest, par value 0.001 per share, of Private BDC outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were converted into a number of TCAP Common Shares equal to a ratio of one to one. As a result, TCAP issued an aggregate of approximately 20.9 million TCAP Common Shares to former Private BDC shareholders. The TCAP Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time remained outstanding upon the Effective Time and were unaffected by the Merger. As a result, immediately following the Merger, TCAP had approximately 20,945,030 Class I shares outstanding, and no Class S or D shares outstanding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 55,691,815 shares issued and outstanding with a par value of 0.001 per share.

 Net Asset Value per Share and Offering Price 
 The Company determines NAV for each class of shares as of the last day of each calendar month. Share issuances related to monthly subscriptions are effective the first calendar day of each month. Shares are issued at an offering price equivalent to the most recent NAV per share available for each share class, which will be the prior calendar day NAV per share (i.e. the prior month-end NAV). The following table presents each month-end NAV per share for the common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Character of Distributions 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and fee and expense reimbursement waivers from the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment, or the Administrator, if any. 
 
 All of the dividends declared for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and were derived from ordinary income, as determined on a tax basis. Taxable income is an estimate and is not fully determined until the Company s tax return is filed. 
 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 
 The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it reinvests all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of our Company s distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 The Company has implemented a share repurchase program under which, at the discretion of the Board, the Company may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the NAV of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, such target amount 
 108 

Table of Contents 

 is assessed each calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time (including to offer to purchase fewer shares) if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, or may only be available in an amount less than 5 of our Common Shares outstanding. 
 
 The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 
 Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

 In connection with the Tranche A Notes and the Tranche B Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to more closely align the interest rates of the Company s liabilities with the investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The Company designated this interest rate swap and the Tranche A Notes and the Tranche B Notes in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship.

 Debt Securitizations 
 
 On May 30, 2024, the Company completed an approximately 445.0 million term debt securitization (the CLO Transaction ). Term debt securitizations are also known as collateralized loan obligations and are a form of secured financing incurred by a subsidiary of the Company, which is consolidated by the Company and subject to the Company s overall asset coverage requirements. The secured notes issued in the CLO Transaction and the secured loan borrowed in the CLO Transaction were issued and incurred, as applicable, by Twin Brook CLO 2024-1 LLC (the Issuer ), an indirect, wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of the Company, and are backed by a portfolio of collateral obligations consisting of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans as well as by other assets of the Issuer. 
 
 The following table presents information on the secured notes and equity interests in the CLO Transaction:

 The secured notes are scheduled to mature on July 20, 2036, unless redeemed by the Issuer, at the direction of the Adviser, serving as collateral manager, on any business day after July 20, 2026. 
 
 The Class A Notes, Class A-L Loans, Class B Notes, Class C Notes and Class D Notes (collectively, the Secured Debt are the secured obligations of the Issuer and the Equity Interests are the unsecured obligations of Issuer. The Class A-L Loans may be exchanged by the lenders for Class A Notes at any time, subject to certain conditions under the indenture and related agreements. The indenture governing the CLO Transaction includes customary covenants and events of default. 
 
 As part of the CLO Transaction, an wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Retention Holder sold and transferred certain middle market loans to the Issuer for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in a loan sale agreement and for future sales from the Retention Holder to the Issuer on an ongoing basis. Such loans constituted the initial portfolio of assets securing the Secured Debt. In connection with such sale and transfer, the Retention Holder made customary representations, warranties and covenants to the Issuer . 
 
 The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or any state securities or blue sky laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the SEC or an applicable exemption from registration. 
 
 The Adviser serves as collateral manager to Issuer under a collateral management agreement and is entitled to receive fees for providing the services; however, the Adviser has waived its right to receive such fees but may rescind such waiver at any time. 
 
 Short-Term Debt 
 
 In order to finance certain investment transactions, the Company may, from time to time, enter into financing agreements, whereby the Company transfers to a third party an investment that it holds in exchange for cash for a period of time, generally not to exceed 180 days from the date it was transferred (each, a Short Term Financing Transaction ). At the expiration of the agreement, the Company returns the cash and interest to the third party and receives the original investment transferred. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have borrowings under Short-Term Financing Transactions with a third party. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 Our investment portfolio may contain debt investments that are in the form of revolving lines of credit and unfunded delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan agreements. Unfunded portfolio company commitments and funded debt investments are presented on the consolidated schedule of investments at fair value. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation, if any, is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and consolidated statements of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments, including delayed draw term loans and revolvers, with an aggregate principal amount of 729,993 million and 324,051 million, respectively. 
 113 

Table of Contents 

 We seek to carefully manage our unfunded portfolio company commitments for purposes of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage ratio, to cover any outstanding portfolio company unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 A summary of our contractual payment obligations under our borrowing arrangements as of September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 
 Payment Due by Period (Amounts in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 3-5 More than 5 years ASPV Credit Facility 260.1 260.1 MSPV Credit Facility 194.0 194.0 Truist Credit Facility 391.8 391.8 Tranche A Notes 90.0 90.0 Tranche B Notes 150.0 150.0 CLO Transaction 369.0 369.0 Total 1,454.9 90.0 995.9 369.0 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the Investment Management Agreement, the Administration Agreement, Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement and the Resource Sharing Agreement. 
 In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we intend to rely on exemptive relief that has been granted to us, our Adviser, and TPG Angelo Gordon to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by TPG Angelo Gordon in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as any regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Item 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6. Agreements and Related Party Transactions for further description of our related party transactions. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. There have been no significant changes this quarter in our critical accounting policies and practices. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of rising interest rates in response to inflation, the Israel-Hamas war and the war in Russia and Ukraine has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effect of the volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and therefore, we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by Adviser, pursuant to Rule 2a-5, based on, among other things, the input of independent third party valuation firm(s) engaged by the Adviser, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for 
 114 

Table of Contents 

 the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We may fund portions of our investments with borrowings on a short term basis, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 99.9 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates with no interest rate floor. Our unsecured notes, which bear interest at fixed rates, are hedged by fixed to floating interest rate swaps in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments and leverage (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to Term SOFR and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 (Amounts in millions) Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income Up 200 basis points 55.0 24.3 30.7 Up 100 basis points 27.4 12.1 15.3 Down 100 basis points (27.4) (12.1) (15.3) Down 200 basis points (54.9) (24.3) (30.6) 
 To a limited extent, we may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts, and credit hedging contracts, such as credit default swaps. However, no assurance can be given that such hedging transactions will be entered into or, if they are, that they will be effective. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
