Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which were included in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 23, 2024. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods. MGM Resorts International together with its subsidiaries may be referred to as we, us or our. MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as MGM China. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 
 Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are: 
 
 Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slot handle (volume indicators); win or hold percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0 to 35.0 of table games drop for baccarat and 19.0 to 23.0 for non-baccarat; and 
 
 Hotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ADR, a price indicator); and revenue per available room RevPAR, a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

Gross interest expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the repayment of the 1.25 billion 6 senior notes in March 2023, the early redemption of the 750 million 6.75 senior notes in May 2024, the repayment of MGM China s 750 million 5.375 senior notes in May 2024, the decrease in the average debt outstanding under MGM China s revolving credit facilities, and the repayment of the LeoVegas senior notes in August 2023, partially offset by the issuances of 850 million 6.125 senior notes in September 2024, 750 million 6.5 senior notes in April 2024, and MGM China s 500 million 7.125 senior notes in June 2024.

 Other, net was income of 93 million and expense of 35 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of a gain related to foreign currency contracts of 87 million, a gain related to debt and equity investments of 55 million, interest and dividend income of 18 million, partially offset by foreign currency transaction loss of 65 million. Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of a loss on debt and equity investments of 52 million, a loss related to foreign currency contracts of 11 million, partially offset by interest and dividend income of 35 million. 
 
 Other, net was income of 45 million and 35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of interest and dividend income of 62 million and a gain related to debt and equity investments of 11 million, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction loss of 28 million and loss related to foreign currency contracts of 13 million.

The effective rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by an increase in Macau gaming profits which are exempt from complementary tax. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by a decrease in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets. The effective rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was favorably impacted primarily by an increase in Macau income that was offset by expiring net operating losses from prior years subject to valuation allowances. 
 
 24 

Reportable segment GAAP measure 
 
 Adjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues. 

Non-GAAP measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAR is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our properties, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing us, as well as comparing our results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.

In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee are limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value. 
 
 The summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was 1.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 billion in the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year period was due primarily to changes in working capital primarily related to payroll liabilities, gaming taxes, and payables, partially offset by the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at MGM China discussed within the Results of Operations section above and a decrease in cash paid for interest and taxes. 
 
 Investing activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our properties. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing properties can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 879 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 421 million in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made payments of 747 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed 182 million to unconsolidated affiliates, paid 114 million related to acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and received 224 million related to net short-term investments in debt securities. In comparison, in the prior year period we made payments of 603 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed 144 million to unconsolidated affiliates, paid 122 million to acquire Push Gaming, net of cash acquired, and made 176 million in net short-term investments in debt securities, which were partially offset by proceeds of 447 million related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica and proceeds of 153 million related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 We made capital expenditures of 747 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 98 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital 
 27 

expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and corporate and other entities of 649 million primarily related to information technology and room remodels. 
 
 We made capital expenditures of 603 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 28 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures related to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate and other entities of 575 million primarily related to land, information technology, room and restaurant remodels, convention center remodels, and gaming equipment. 
 
 Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was 774 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.2 billion in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net borrowings of debt of 581 million, as further discussed below, paid 1.2 billion for repurchases of our common stock as further discussed in Note 10, and distributed 104 million to noncontrolling interest owners. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of 2.2 billion, as further discussed below, paid 1.7 billion for repurchases of our common stock, and distributed 169 million to noncontrolling interest owners. 
 
 Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net borrowings of debt of 581 million, which primarily consisted of our issuance of 850 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.125 notes due 2029, our issuance of 750 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.5 notes due 2032, and the issuance of MGM China s 500 million of aggregate principal amount of 7.125 notes due 2031, partially offset by the repayment of 750 million of aggregate principal amount of our 6.75 notes due 2025, the repayment of MGM China s 750 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.375 notes due 2024 upon maturity, and net repayments of 19 million on MGM China s first revolving credit facility . 
 
 The net proceeds from the issuance of the 850 million 6.125 notes due 2029 were used to fund the early redemption of our 675 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75 notes due 2025 at a redemption price of 100.607 in October 2024, with the remainder primarily used for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 750 million 6.5 notes due 2032 were used to fund the early redemption our 750 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75 notes due 2025 in May 2024. The repayment of MGM China s 750 million 5.375 notes due 2024 was funded with draws on its first revolving credit facility, which were partially repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of its 500 million 7.125 notes due 2031. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of 2.2 billion, which consisted of the repayment of 1.25 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 6 senior notes due 2023 upon maturity, aggregate net repayments of 931 million on MGM China s revolving credit facilities, and the early repayment of LeoVegas s senior notes due 2023 of 36 million. The net repayments of debt were funded with cash on hand. 
 
 Share Repurchases and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 1.2 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. See Note 10 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the February 2023 2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. The remaining availability under the November 2023 2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was 946 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased and retired 1.7 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. 
 
 In March 2024, MGM China s Board of Directors declared a special dividend for 2023 of 51 million, which was paid in April 2024, of which we received approximately 29 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately 22 million. A final dividend for 2023 of 118 million was declared in March 2024, approved by the shareholders in May 2024, and paid in June 2024, of which we received approximately 66 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately 52 million. 
 
 Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash 
 
 We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. 
 28 

Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic properties daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.0 billion, of which MGM China held 563 million, and we had 7.0 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including 2.9 billion related to MGM China. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility or MGM China s second revolving credit facility and, as of September 30, 2024, there was 354 million outstanding under MGM China s first revolving credit facility. 
 
 In October 2024, we funded the early redemption of our 675 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.75 notes due 2025. In February 2024, we amended our senior secured credit facility to increase the facility to 2.3 billion and extend the maturity date to February 2029. In May 2024, MGM China further exercised the option to increase the amount of the second revolving facility to its full capacity, as further discussed in Note 5. 
 
 Our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months, based on principal amounts of debt outstanding and contractual maturity da tes and interest rates, each as of September 30, 2024, and reflecting the early redemption of our 5.75 notes due 2025 in October 2024, are approximately 200 million to 220 million, excluding MGM China, and approximately 380 million to 400 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China. 
 
 We are also required, as of September 30, 2024, to make annual cash rent payments of 1.8 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. 
 
 We have planned capital expen ditures expected over the remainder of 2024 of approximately 300 million to 350 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately 40 million to 60 million at MGM China, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of the gaming concession investment for 2024 that relates to capital projects. 
 
 We continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence and pursuing a commercial gaming facility in New York, which may require cash commitments in the future. If our pursuit of a commercial gaming facility in New York is successful, we expect the project cost to be approximately 2 billion, inclusive of a 500 million license fee, with the amount and timing of costs dependent upon progress of the project and selection process. Additionally, we have cash commitments to fund Osaka IR KK relating to the development of an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan for our proportionate share of the unfinanced portion of Osaka IR KK s development project, of which the remaining amount of 271 billion yen (approximately 1.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 is anticipated to be funded over the next five years. Our funding amount is subject to change due to inflation, the progress and scope of the development, and other factors, which we expect may increase the funding. Refer to Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our commitments and guarantees. 
 
 In August 2024, MGM China s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of 173 million, which was paid in October 2024, of which we received approximately 97 million and noncontrolling interests received approximately 76 million. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end.

Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk from the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, other than those below. 
 
 Interest rate risk. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 5 of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates : 
 Debt maturing in Fair Value September 30, 2024 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total (In millions except interest rates) 
 Fixed-rate 1,175 1,150 1,425 750 2,100 6,600 6,586 Average interest rate N/A 5.5 5.4 5.1 4.8 6.5 5.6 Variable rate 354 354 354 Average interest rate N/A N/A 6.8 N/A N/A N/A 6.8 
 
 Foreign currency risk. Our worldwide operations are conducted in multiple foreign currencies, but we report our financial results in U.S. dollars. We manage the foreign currency risk through normal operating activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 We hold forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of forward contracts was 1.1 billion and a 10 adverse change in the exchange rate would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately 107 million.

 33 

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 See discussion of legal proceedings in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 A description of certain factors that may affect our future results and risk factors is set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to those factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including our rent payments and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of the landlords of Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, and MGM Grand Las Vegas could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations . As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 7.0 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, including 2.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China s obligations under its debt agreements and, to the extent MGM China was to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into MGM China is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility. 
 
 In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including: 
 
 increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; 
 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements; 
 making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors. 
 
 We currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the 3.01 billion and 3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of the landlords of Bellagio and Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future. We also provide for guarantees (i) in the amount of 12.65 billion yen (approximately 88 million as of September 30, 2024) for 50 of Osaka IR KK s obligations to Osaka under various agreements related to the venture s development of an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan and (ii) of an uncapped amount to provide funding to Osaka IR KK, if necessary, for the completion of the construction and full opening of the integrated resort. The guarantees expire when the obligations relating to the full opening of the integrated resort are fulfilled. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy any obligations with respect to any of these guarantees or our other financial commitments, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. 
 
 Under the terms of MGM Grand Paradise s concession, MGM Grand Paradise is required to implement certain investments in gaming and non-gaming projects, for which the non-gaming commitment is subject to increase if market-wide Macau annual gross gaming revenue reaches a specified level. There can be no assurance, however, that MGM Grand Paradise will have sufficient cash on hand to fund these obligations, including any increased investment amounts to the extent they are triggered in the future, or that it would be able to obtain financing to fund these obligations on satisfactory terms or at all. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to satisfy its investment commitments, its concession contract may be subject to termination by the Macau government. 
 
 34 

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed properties to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. The leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, strategic initiatives, including positioning BetMGM as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, investments in the growth of our international digital gaming business, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 The following table provides information about share repurchases of our common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024:

 In November 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a 2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. Under the stock repurchase plans, we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be purchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. All shares we repurchased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were purchased pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase plan and have been retired. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) , or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).

EXHIBIT A 
 ARBITRATION 
 This Exhibit A sets forth the methods for resolving disputes should any arise under the Agreement, and accordingly, this Exhibit A shall be considered a part of the Agreement. 
 1. Except for a claim by either Participant or the Company for injunctive relief where such would be otherwise authorized by law, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach hereof including without limitation any claim involving the interpretation or application of the Agreement or the Plan, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the employment arbitration rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service JAMS ), to the extent not inconsistent with this paragraph. This Exhibit A covers any claim Participant might have against any officer, director, employee, or agent of the Company, or any of the Company s subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, and all successors and assigns of any of them. The promises by the Company and Participant to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide consideration for each other, in addition to other consideration provided under the Agreement. 
 2. Claims Subject to Arbitration . This Exhibit A contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Only claims that are justiciable under applicable state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit A. Such claims include any and all alleged violations of any state or federal law whether common law, statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other law, brought by any current or former employees. 
 3. Non-Waiver of Substantive Rights . This Exhibit A does not waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or common law. However, it does waive Participant s right to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum. By signing the Agreement and the acknowledgment at the end of this Exhibit A, the undersigned Participant voluntarily agrees to arbitrate his or her claims covered by this Exhibit A. 
 4. Time Limit to Pursue Arbitration Initiation To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Participant and the Company must initiate arbitration within the statute of limitations (deadline for filing) provided for by applicable law pertaining to the claim. The failure to initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such claim. The parties understand that the Company and Participant are waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party is encouraged to give written notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly. The parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit A, give written notice of a claim pursuant to Section 7 of the Agreement. In the event such notice is to be provided to the Company, the Participant shall provide a copy of such notice of a claim to the Company s Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Written notice shall identify and describe the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought. 

5. Selecting an Arbitrator This Exhibit A mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) regarding employment disputes. The arbitrator shall be either a retired judge or an attorney experienced in employment law and licensed to practice in the state in which arbitration is convened. The parties shall select one arbitrator from among a list of three qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS. If the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, each party shall strike one name and the remaining named arbitrator shall be selected. 
 6. Representation Arbitration Rights and Procedures 
 a. Participant may be represented by an attorney of his her choice at his her own expense. 
 b. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard to its choice of law provisions) and or federal law when applicable. In all cases, this Exhibit A shall provide for the broadest level of arbitration of claims between the Company and Participant under Nevada or applicable federal law. The arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies. 
 c. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such relief is specifically authorized by an applicable state or federal statute or common law. In such a situation, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the specific statute or other basis under which such relief is granted. 
 d. The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to compromise must be followed. 
 e. The parties shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition) discovery and to subpoena and or request copies of records, documents and other relevant discoverable information consistent with the procedural rules of JAMS. The arbitrator shall decide disputes regarding the scope of discovery and shall have authority to regulate the conduct of any hearing and or trial proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the right to entertain a motion to dismiss and or motion for summary judgment. 
 f. The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial hearing procedure. The arbitrator shall have subpoena power so that either Participant or the Company may summon witnesses. The arbitrator shall use the Federal Rules of Evidence. Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief. Any party, at its own expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings. 
 g. Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
 7. Arbitrator s Award The arbitrator shall issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific findings of fact, and the specific conclusions of law. The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion of the arbitration 
 15 

hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if requested. The arbitrator may not award any relief or remedy in excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The arbitrator s decision is final and binding on both parties. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. 
 a. Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit A and to enforce an arbitration award. 
 b. In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on behalf of Participant which is subject to arbitration under this Exhibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in any such action, and Participant s sole remedy with respect to any such claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A. 
 8. Fees and Expenses The Company shall be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator provided, however, that if Participant is the party initiating the claim, Participant will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which Participant is (or was last) employed by the Company. Participant and the Company shall each pay for their own expenses, attorney s fees (a party s responsibility for his her its own attorney s fees is only limited by any applicable statute specifically providing that attorney s fees may be awarded as a remedy), and costs and fees regarding witness, photocopying and other preparation expenses. If any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorney s fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorney s fees and or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim(s). 
 9. The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A shall survive the termination of Participant s employment with the Company and the expiration of the Agreement. These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed by both parties and which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the provisions of this Exhibit A. 
 10. The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A do not alter or affect the termination provisions of this Agreement. 
 11. Capitalized terms not defined in this Exhibit A shall have the same definition as in the Agreement to which this is Exhibit A. 
 12. If any provision of this Exhibit A is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of Exhibit A. All other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
