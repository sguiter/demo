If the Company fails to raise sufficient capital in this offering, it will have to explore other financing activities to provide it with the liquidity and capital resources it needs to meet its working capital requirements and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. Since the Company cannot give assurance that it will be able to secure the necessary capital when needed, there is a substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue operations as a going concern following the issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements.

Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as believes , anticipates , intends or expects . These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete financing, to enter into future agreements with companies, and plans to successfully expend our business operations and the sale of our products. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. 

Although we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.

We caution you therefore that you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements as statements of historical fact or as guarantees or assurances of future performance.

Plan of Operations 

Over the course of the 12 months following our Public Offering pursuant to the S-1 Registration Statement, we plan to spend a substantial portion of our effort in the promotion of our services to potential clients. We intend to utilize the business network of shareholders, officers, directors and employees to identify potential opportunities. 

Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy to pay a referral fee to our shareholders, officers, directors, and employees in the event that we have successfully completed an assignment as either a joint project manager or a sole project manager as a result of receiving a referral from any of these parties. The amount of the referral fee payable by us to any of these parties is determined on a negotiated basis and is in line with that payable to independent consultants, which has a maximum of 15 on our project management fee including both the cash component and stock compensation, if any. If we receive a direct referral from an independent consultant, we either serve the client together as joint project managers, if responsibilities are shared between us, or we act as the sole project manager, if the referring consultant is not involved in the provision of services. The referral fee for each individual project is determined by negotiation and is only payable after the referred assignment is successfully completed. Our directors review these charges periodically and adjust them to enhance our competitiveness under prevailing market conditions. The payment of successful-basis referral fees to our shareholders, officers, directors and employees is designed to serve as an incentive for them to develop our business with a collective effort. 

Our estimated costs for the next 12 months will be 80,000. If we fail to raise sufficient capital in the Public Offering, we will have to explore other financing activities to provide us with the liquidity and capital resources we need to meet our working capital requirements and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations. We cannot give assurance that we are able to secure needed capital to support our day-to-day operations. If we do not have sufficient capital to support our day-to-day operations, our shareholders may lose their entire investment in us. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going Concern Uncertainties 

As discussed in the notes to financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 16,787 of cash all of which will be used to pay the unpaid amount of the estimated costs of the Company s Public Offering. If the Company fails to raise sufficient capital in the Public Offering, it will have to explore other financing activities to provide it with the liquidity and capital resources it needs to meet its working capital requirements and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations. The Company cannot give assurance that it will be able to secure the necessary capital when needed. Consequently, the Company raises substantial doubt that it will be able to continue operations as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its generating cash flow sufficient to fund operations and reducing operating expenses. The Company s business plans may not be successful in addressing the cash flow issues. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern, its shareholders may lose their entire investment in the Company. 

15 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position. Our critical accounting estimates are more fully discussed in Note 3 to our unaudited financial statements contained herein. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Not applicable because we are an emerging growth company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 

Management has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment. Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff. The small size of the Company s accounting outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. 

These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements the three months ended September 30, 2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 2013 Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
