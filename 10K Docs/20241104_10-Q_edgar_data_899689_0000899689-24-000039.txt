EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of Vornado Realty Trust and Vornado Realty L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Vornado refer to Vornado Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to the Operating Partnership and VRLP refer to Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. References to the Company, we, us and our mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado. 
 The Operating Partnership is the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. Vornado is the sole general partner and also a 91.3 limited partner of the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Vornado has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. 
 Under the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, unitholders may present their Class A units for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time). Class A units may be tendered for redemption to the Operating Partnership for cash; Vornado, at its option, may assume that obligation and pay the holder either cash or Vornado common shares on a one-for-one basis. Because the number of Vornado common shares outstanding at all times equals the number of Class A units owned by Vornado, the redemption value of each Class A unit is equivalent to the market value of one Vornado common share, and the distribution to a Class A unitholder is equal to the dividend paid to a Vornado common shareholder. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. Vornado generally expects that it will elect to issue its common shares in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having the Operating Partnership pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, Vornado s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever Vornado issues common shares other than to acquire Class A units of the Operating Partnership, Vornado must contribute any net proceeds it receives to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership must issue to Vornado an equivalent number of Class A units of the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. 
 The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Vornado and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 enhances investors understanding of Vornado and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both Vornado and the Operating Partnership; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies in the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between Vornado and the Operating Partnership in the context of how Vornado and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of Vornado. Vornado does not have any significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership, not Vornado, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of Vornado. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of Vornado. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by Vornado, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for Class A units of partnership in the Operating Partnership, and the net proceeds of debt offerings by Vornado, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for debt securities of the Operating Partnership, as applicable, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources may include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties.

 Deferred Compensation Plan Assets 
 Deferred compensation plan assets that are classified as Level 3 consist of investments in limited partnerships and investment funds, which are managed by third parties. We receive quarterly financial reports that provide net asset values on a fair value basis from a third-party administrator, which are compiled from the quarterly reports provided to them from each limited partnership and investment fund. The period of time over which these underlying assets are expected to be liquidated is unknown. The third-party administrator does not adjust these values in determining our share of the net assets and we do not adjust these values when reported in our consolidated financial statements.

We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of billion per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below), billion for non-certified acts of terrorism, and billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological NBCR terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. 
 Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC PPIC ), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third-party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of and of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC. 
 Certain condominiums in which we own an interest (including the Farley Condominiums) maintain insurance policies with different per occurrence and aggregate limits than our policies described above. 
 We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material . 
 Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 
 In January 2022, we exercised the second of renewal options on our PENN 1 ground lease. The first renewal option period commenced June 2023 and, together with the second option exercise, extends the lease term through June 2073. The ground lease is subject to fair market value resets at each renewal period. The rent reset process for the June 2023 renewal period is currently ongoing and the timing is uncertain. The final fair market value determination may be materially higher or lower than our January 2022 estimate.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They represent our intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our future results, financial condition and business may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as approximates, believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, would, may or other similar expressions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. We also note the following forward-looking statements: in the case of our development and redevelopment projects, the estimated completion date, estimated project cost and cost to complete; estimates of future capital expenditures, dividends to common and preferred shareholders and operating partnership distributions. Many of the factors that will determine the outcome of these and our other forward-looking statements are beyond our ability to control or predict. For further discussion of factors that could materially affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Currently, some of the factors are the impacts of the increase in interest rates and inflation on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, operating performance and the effect that these factors have had and may continue to have on our tenants, the global, national, regional and local economies and financial markets and the real estate market in general. 
 For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a discussion of our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.

 85 Tenth Avenue 
 On September 24, 2024, a joint venture, in which we have a 49.9 interest, modified the terms of the 625,000,000 mortgage loan on 85 Tenth Avenue. Per the original loan agreement, the mortgage loan is comprised of a (i) 396,000,000 3.82 senior note, (ii) 129,000,000 5.20 mezzanine A note and (iii) 100,000,000 6.60 mezzanine B note. The modification provides for the interest payments due under the mezzanine notes to be deferred until the December 2026 loan maturity. The deferred amounts will not accrue additional interest. The cash available from the deferred interest payments will be used to fund leasing costs at the property. At loan maturity, if there is no event of default, repayment of 50 of the accrued mezzanine interest will be waived. 
 Alexander's 
 On September 30, 2024, Alexander s, in which we own a 32.4 common equity interest, completed a 400,000,000 refinancing of the office condominium portion of 731 Lexington Avenue, the Bloomberg LP headquarters building. The interest-only loan carries a fixed rate of 5.04 and matures in October 2028. The loan is prepayable, at Alexander s option, with no penalty, beginning in October 2026. The loan replaces the previous 490,000,000 loan on the office condominium, that bore interest at the Prime Rate and was scheduled to mature in October 2024. 
 Interest Rate Hedging 
 We entered into the following interest rate swap and cap arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 15 - Fair Value Measurements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our consolidated hedging instruments:

 ____________________ 
 (1) Together with the existing 250,000 swap arrangement on the 500,000 PENN 11 mortgage loan, the loan will bear interest at an all-in swapped rate of 6.28 through October 2025. 
 Acquisitions 
 On August 6, 2024, we purchased a 50,000,000 B-Note secured by a Midtown Manhattan property at par. The B-Note, together with the 35,000,000 A-Note, is in default. The B-Note accrues interest at 5.25 plus 4.00 default interest. The 50,000,000 B-Note investment was recorded to other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Dispositions 
 220 Central Park South 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we closed on the sale of two condominium units at 220 CPS for net proceeds of 31,605,000, resulting in a financial statement net gain of 15,175,000 which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. In connection with these sales, 2,106,000 of income tax expense was recognized on our consolidated statements of income. Four units remain unsold, with a carrying value of 21,030,000 which is included in "other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 50-70 West 93rd Street 
 On May 13, 2024, we sold our 49.9 interest in 50-70 West 93rd Street to our joint venture partner. We received net proceeds of 2,000,000 after deducting our share of the existing 83,500,000 mortgage loan, which was scheduled to mature in December 2024, resulting in a net gain of 873,000. The net gain is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income. 
 Alexander s 
 On May 3, 2024, Alexander s, in which we own a 32.4 common equity interest, and Bloomberg L.P. reached an agreement to extend the leases covering approximately 947,000 square feet at 731 Lexington Avenue that were scheduled to expire in February 2029 for a term of eleven years to February 2040.

NOI At Share by Segment for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

 NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities. NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, accruals for ground rent resets yet to be determined, and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to September 30, 2023 

 Same Store Net Operating Income At Share 
 Same store NOI at share represents NOI at share from operations which are in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods. Same store NOI at share - cash basis is same store NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, accruals for ground rent resets yet to be determined, and other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store NOI at share and same store NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to our shareholders, distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development and redevelopment costs. The sources of liquidity to fund these cash requirements include rental revenue, which is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties, proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loans and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.6 billion of liquidity comprised of 1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and 1.6 billion available on our 2.2 billion revolving credit facilities. The ongoing challenges posed by the increase in interest rates and inflation could adversely impact our cash flow from continuing operations but we anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months together with cash balances on hand will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to our shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. We anticipate that we will pay a common share dividend for 2024 in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Trustees. Capital requirements for development and redevelopment expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, equity offerings and/or asset sales. 
 We may from time to time repurchase or retire our outstanding debt securities or repurchase or redeem our equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2023, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to 200,000,000 of our outstanding common shares under a share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 170,857,000 remained available and authorized for repurchases. 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash was 1,029,075,000 as of September 30, 2024, a 232,509,000 decrease from the balance as of December 31, 2023.

In connection therewith, we entered into a joint venture with Rudin (the Vornado/Rudin JV that purchased 39 East 51st Street for 40,000,000, funded on a 50/50 basis by Vornado and Rudin. 39 East 51st Street will be combined with 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street to create a premier development site (the 350 Park Site ). From October 2024 to June 2030, an affiliate of KG will have the option to either (i) acquire a 60 interest in a joint venture with the Vornado/Rudin JV (with Vornado having an effective 36 interest in the entity) to build a new 1,700,000 square foot office tower, valuing the 350 Park Site at 1.2 billion or (ii) purchase the 350 Park Site for 1.4 billion 1.085 billion to Vornado). From October 2024 to September 2030, the Vornado/Rudin JV will have the option to put the 350 Park Site to KG for 1.2 billion 900,000,000 to Vornado). 
 We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the PENN District. 
 There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget. 
 
 Insurance 
 For our properties, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of 300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which 275,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage and we maintain all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of 2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake, excluding communicable disease coverage. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of 350,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5 of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of 6.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below), 1.2 billion for non-certified acts of terrorism, and 5.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological NBCR terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. 
 Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC PPIC ), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third-party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of 2,112,753 and 20 of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC. 
 Certain condominiums in which we own an interest (including the Farley Condominiums) maintain insurance policies with different per occurrence and aggregate limits than our policies described above. 
 We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material . 
 Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us.

 Other Commitments and Contingencies - continued 
 In January 2022, we exercised the second of three 25-year renewal options on our PENN 1 ground lease. The first renewal option period commenced June 2023 and, together with the second option exercise, extends the lease term through June 2073. The ground lease is subject to fair market value resets at each 25-year renewal period. The rent reset process for the June 2023 renewal period is currently ongoing and the timing is uncertain. The final fair market value determination may be materially higher or lower than our January 2022 estimate. 
 We may, from time to time, enter into guarantees including, but not limited to, payment guarantees to lenders of unconsolidated joint ventures for tax purposes, completion guarantees for development and redevelopment projects, and guarantees to fund leasing costs. These agreements terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified obligations or repayment of the underlying loans. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees was approximately 535,935,000, primarily comprised of payment guarantees for the mortgage loans secured by 7 West 34th Street and 435 Seventh Avenue. Other than these loans, our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 30,233,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured notes. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 
 Our 95 consolidated joint venture (5 is owned by Related Companies ("Related")) developed and owns the Farley Building. In connection with the development of the property, the joint venture admitted a historic tax credit investor partner (the "Tax Credit Investor"). Under the terms of the historic tax credit arrangement, the joint venture is required to comply with various laws, regulations, and contractual provisions. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, may require a refund or reduction of the Tax Credit Investor s capital contributions. As of September 30, 2024, the Tax Credit Investor has made 208,407,000 in capital contributions. Vornado and Related have guaranteed certain of the joint venture s obligations to the Tax Credit Investor. 
 We are the general partner and investment manager of Vornado Capital Partners Real Estate Fund (the Fund and own a 25.0 interest in the Fund. As of September 30, 2024, our share of unfunded commitments to the Fund was 5,769,000. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had construction commitments aggregating approximately 67,959,000.

Funds From Operations FFO 

 Vornado Realty Trust 
 FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 13 (Loss) Income Per Share and Per Class A Unit in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Details of certain adjustments to FFO are discussed in the financial results summary of our Overview . 
 Below is a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
