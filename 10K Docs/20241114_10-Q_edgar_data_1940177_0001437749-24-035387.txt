 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 For the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

million. In accordance with the push down basis of accounting, the Company s net assets were adjusted to their fair values as of the date of the acquisition based upon an independent appraisal. The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Courtside, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and PodcastOne Sales, LLC, a California limited liability company. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The results of operations and financial position of the Company are consolidated with LiveOne s financial statements and these financial statements have been derived as if the Company had operated on a standalone basis during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and include all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. The amounts recorded for related party transactions with LiveOne may not be considered arm s length transactions and therefore, the financial statements may not necessarily reflect the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows had the Company engaged in such transactions with an unrelated third party during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Accordingly, the Company s historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future, if and when the Company contracts at arm s length with unrelated third parties for services they receive from LiveOne. The results for the six months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 fiscal 2025 ). The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024 has been derived from the Company s audited balance sheet included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 -K (the "Annual Report"), filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on July 1, 2024. 
 
 The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S- X. They do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete audited financial statements. Therefore, these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report. 
 
 Going Concern and Liquidity 
 
 The Company s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
 The Company s principal sources of liquidity have historically been its debt issuances and its cash and cash equivalents (which cash and cash equivalents amounted to million as of September 30, 2024 ). The Company has an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million as of September 30, 2024 . These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these financial statements are filed. The Company s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is looking for additional financing sources to attempt to secure additional interim financing, which is needed to continue its current level of business operations and satisfy its current obligations, unless such financing is provided by LiveOne, if at all. In the absence of additional sources of liquidity, management anticipates that existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet current operating and liquidity needs beyond November 2025. There is no assurance that management will be able to obtain additional liquidity or be successful in raising additional funds or that such required funds, if available, or that LiveOne will provide any financing to the Company, if at all, or that any such financing will be available on attractive terms or that it will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders. In addition, management is unable to determine at this time whether any of these potential sources of liquidity will be adequate to support the Company s future business operations. While the Company does not currently anticipate delays or hindrances to its current business operations and initiatives schedule due to liquidity constraints, without additional funding the Company may not be able to continue its current level of business operations in the future. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 
 The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Acquisitions are included in the Company s interim audited condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company uses purchase accounting for its acquisitions, which results in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

million and million, respectively. Barter revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. 

million and million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 

The Company believes that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large and established nature of its largest customers and the nature of its receivables. 
 
 The Company s accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):

 years), furniture and fixtures to years), leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term and capitalized software years). 
 
 The Company evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment if there are indicators of potential impairment. If there are indicators of potential impairment, the Company performs an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset group carrying value by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset group. If it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset group, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Fair value is generally estimated using valuation techniques that consider the discounted cash flows of the asset group using discount and capitalization rates deemed reasonable for the type of assets, as well as prevailing market conditions, appraisals, recent similar transactions in the market and, if appropriate and available, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. 

The Company s annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company generally tests goodwill for possible impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If a quantitative test is performed, the Company determines the fair value of the related reporting unit and compare this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value of the Company s reporting unit is determined using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, an impairment charge is recorded. indicators of impairments of goodwill were identified during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Estimations and assumptions regarding future performance, results of the Company s operations and comparability of its market capitalization and net book value will be used. 
 
 years), Customer, and Content Creator - years). 
 
 The Company reviews all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded impairment losses of million and none during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No impairment loss was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts, and management believes that the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to such cash and cash equivalents. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 ): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023 - 09 ), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023 - 09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023 - 09 beginning in the first quarter of 2026. ASU 2023 - 09 allows for adoption using either a prospective or retrospective transition method The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.

In connection with the sale of the PC1 Notes, the Purchasers received warrants (the PC1 Warrants to purchase a number of shares (the PC1 Warrant Shares of the Company s common stock. The PC1 Notes were scheduled to mature on July 15, 2023, subject to a one -time three -month extension at the Company s election (the Maturity Date ). The Company elected the extension and extended the maturity date to October 15, 2023. The PC1 Notes bore interest at a rate of per annum payable on maturity. The PC1 Notes automatically convert into the securities of the Company sold in a Qualified Financing (an initial public offering of the Company s securities from which the Company s trading market at the closing of such offering is a national securities exchange) or Qualified Event (a direct listing of the Company s securities on a national securities exchange), as applicable, upon the closing of a Qualified Financing or Qualified Event, as applicable, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price equal to million divided by the aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of a Qualified Financing or Qualified Event, as applicable (assuming full conversion or exercise of all convertible and exercisable securities of the Company then outstanding, subject to certain exceptions), and (ii) of the offering price of the shares (or whole units, as applicable) in the Qualified Financing or of the initial listing price of the shares on a national securities exchange in the Qualified Event, as applicable. Each holder of the PC1 Notes (other than LiveOne) may at such holder s option require the Company to redeem up to of the principal amount of such holder s PC1 Notes (together with accrued interest thereon, but excluding the OID), in aggregate up to for all of the PC1 Notes (other than those held by LiveOne), immediately prior to the completion of a Qualified Financing or a Qualified Event, as applicable, with such redemption to be made pro rata to the redeeming holders of the PC1 Notes (the Optional Redemption ). Upon a Purchaser s redemption of any PC1 Notes pursuant to the Optional Redemption right, then a portion of such Purchaser s PC1 Warrants shall be forfeited and cancelled in accordance with the following formula: for each 0.001 million of the principal amount of the PC1 Notes redeemed, PC1 Warrants to purchase of the Warrant Shares issued per 0.001 million of the principal amount of the PC1 Notes shall be immediately forfeited and cancelled. 
 
 LiveOne also agreed (i) not to effect a Qualified Financing or a Qualified Event, as applicable, unless immediately following such event LiveOne owns no less than of the Company s equity, unless in either case otherwise permitted by the written consent of the holders of the majority of the PC1 Notes (excluding LiveOne) (the Majority Noteholders and LiveOne s senior lender, as applicable, (ii) that until a Qualified Financing or a Qualified Event, as applicable, is consummated, LiveOne guaranteed the repayment of the PC1 Notes when due (other than the Bridge Notes issued to LiveOne) and any interest or other fees due thereunder, and (iii) that if the Company has not consummated a Qualified Financing or a Qualified Event, as applicable, by February 15, 2023, March 15, 2023 or April 15, 2023, as applicable, unless in either case permitted by the written consent of the Majority Noteholders, the Company was required to redeem of the then outstanding PC1 Notes pro rata from the PC1 Notes holders (other than the PC1 Notes issued to LiveOne) by the tenth calendar day of each month immediately following such respective date, up to an aggregate redemption of over the course of such three months, each of which shall be distributed to the holders of the PC1 Notes (other than LiveOne) on a prorated basis (the Early Redemption ). 
 
 The Company further agreed to register the shares of its common stock issuable upon conversion of the PC1 Notes and exercise of the PC1 Warrants in connection with a Qualified Financing or a Qualified Event. If the Company did not file such registration statement on or prior to April 15, 2023, the Company was required to prepay of the PC1 Notes pro rata to the PC1 Notes holders (other than LiveOne), and if the Company did not file such registration statement on or prior to July 15, 2023, the Company was required to prepay of the PC1 Notes pro rata to the PC1 Notes holders (other than LiveOne) (the Reg St Redemption ). The Company was not required to redeem or repay more than a total of of the principal amount of the PC1 Notes as a result of the Optional Redemption, the Early Redemption and/or the Reg St Redemption. 
 
 During the year ended March 31, 2024 , the Company redeemed million of principal on the PC1 Notes. 
 
 On September 8, 2023, the Company completed a Qualified Event (its direct listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the "Spin-Out")) as a result of its direct listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market on such date (the "Direct Listing"). In connection with such completed Qualified Event, all of the remaining PC1 Notes (including interest thereunder) in the aggregate amount of approximately million converted into approximately 2,341,000 shares of the Company s common stock. 

Warrants 
 
 The PC1 Warrants are classified as liabilities at inception of the PC1 Bridge Loan as they represent an obligation to deliver a variable number of shares of the Company s common stock in the future and are therefore required to be initially and subsequently measured at fair value each reporting period. The Company recorded a warrant liability in the amount of million (and reduced the proceeds allocated to the PC1 Notes accordingly). The fair value of the PC1 Warrant liability is remeasured each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation model, and the change in fair value is recorded as an adjustment to the PC1 Warrant liability with the unrealized gains or losses reflected in other income (expense). On September 8, 2023, as a result of the Spin-Out, the number of shares of PodcastOne's common stock into which PC1 Warrants were exercisable was fixed based on the exercise price of per share. As a result, the Company reclassed its million warrant liability as of September 8, 2023 to equity within additional paid in capital. As of September 30, 2024 there were common stock warrants issued and outstanding. 
 
 The fair value of the PC1 Warrants is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement , using Black Scholes modeling, incorporating the following inputs:

The fair value of the Redemption Liability was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. On September 8, 2023, the Company completed its Spin-Out, therefore the redemption feature was cancelled and not exercised by the holder. Based on the fair value of the shares traded on September 8, 2023, the Company valued the derivative at million.

 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings and other matters arising in connection with the conduct of its business activities. Many of these proceedings may be at preliminary stages and/or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, except as set forth below, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Also see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024. 
 
 Parent Company Debt 
 
 The senior credit facility held by the Company s parent, LiveOne, contains provisions that limit the Company s operating activities, including covenant relating to the requirement to maintain a certain amount cash at LiveOne of million (as was subsequently reduced and maybe adjusted from time to time). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the senior lender may among other things, terminate its obligations thereunder, accelerate its debt and require LiveOne and/or the Company to repay all amounts thereunder. For example, on October 13, 2022, a judgement was entered in favor of SoundExchange, Inc. SX against LiveOne and Slacker in the United States District Court Central District of California in the amount of approximately million. In February 2023, the parties settled the dispute. LiveOne s debt agreements with the provider of its senior credit facility contains a covenant that if a material adverse change occurs in its financial condition, or such lender reasonably believes the prospect of payment or performance of their loan is materially impaired, the lender at its option may immediately accelerate its debt and require LiveOne and the Company to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder. If for any reason LiveOne fails to comply with the terms of its settlement agreement with SX, its senior credit facility provider may declare an event of default and at its option may immediately accelerate its debt and require LiveOne and the Company to repay all outstanding amounts owed under the senior credit facility, which would materially adversely impact the Company s business, operating results and financial condition. On September 8, 2023 and effective as of August 22, 2023, LiveOne entered into a new Business Loan Agreement with the senior credit facility provider to convert the senior credit facility into an assets backed loan credit facility, which shall continue to be collateralized by a first lien on all of the assets of LiveOne and its subsidiaries (the ABL Credit Facility ). The Business Loan Agreement provides LiveOne with borrowing capacity of up to the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Business Loan Agreement). Pursuant to the Business Loan Agreement, the requirement that LiveOne and its related entities shall at all times maintain a certain minimum deposit with the senior credit facility provider was reduced from to . In August 2023, LiveOne entered into a million secured loan with Capchase which accrues interest at and matures months form issuance (the Capchase Loan ).

 On September 8, 2023, the Company completed the Spin-Out and converted the outstanding PC1 Bridge Loan into shares of common stock based on a fair value of per share, which was the closing price of the stock on the date of conversion. The book value of the PC1 Bridge Loan and the bifurcated embedded derivative were converted into additional paid in capital, which equaled the fair value of the shares issued for the conversion of the PC1 Bridge Loan. As a result of the completion of the Spin-Out and the PodcastOne shares becoming publicly traded, the Company reclassified its warrant liability to equity as a result of the strike price and number of warrants becoming fixed at per share, which resulted in a million increase to additional paid in capital. In addition, the Company's derivative liability was written to zero as the redemption feature was unexercised. 
 
 Finder's Agreement 
 
 In September 2023, the Company entered into a finder's fee arrangement pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue shares of its common stock at a price of per share (subject to adjustment in certain limited circumstances) as a finder s fee to a certain third party podcast platform in the event certain former and/or current podcast content creators of such platform entered into new podcasting agreements with the Company, with the amount of the fee to be based on the amount of revenues actually derived by the Company from such podcasts during a predetermined period.

Overview 
 
 We incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 5, 2014 and are a leading podcast platform and publisher that makes our content available to audiences via all podcasting distribution platforms, including our website (www.podcastone.com), our PodcastOne app, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music and more. We were recently ranked #12 on the September 2024 list of Top Podcast Publishers by the podcast metric company Podtrac. 
 
 After the completion of the spin-out of our Company from LiveOne the ("Spin-Out"), we became a standalone publicly traded company trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol PODC . We remain a majority owned subsidiary of LiveOne, a Nasdaq listed company. We intend to mitigate risk by acquiring multiple assets over time and across a broad spectrum of podcast related media and companies. We intend to develop these assets to provide returns via organic growth, revenue production, out-licensing, sale or spin out. 
 
 We also produce vodcasts (video podcasts), branded podcasts, merchandise and live events on behalf of our talent and clients. With a proven 360-degree advertiser solution for multiplatform integration opportunities and hyper-targeting, we deliver millions of monthly impressions, 5.7+ million monthly unique listeners and 19+ million IAB monthly downloads. With content covering all verticals (i.e. sports, entertainment, true-crime, business, audio dramas, self-growth, etc.), we provide a platform for brands to reach their most sought after targeted audiences. 
 
 Our operating model is focused on offering white glove service to our shows, talent and advertising clients. With an in-house sales, production, marketing, and tech team, we believe PodcastOne delivers more to clients and talent than any other publisher in the marketplace. This allows us to scale our operations while attracting talent who bring in brand advertisers and revenue. We earn revenue through the sale of embedded host-read ads, dynamic ads (host read and otherwise), segment sponsorships, and programmatic monetization channels. We also provide the opportunity for clients to have 100 share of voice with branded podcast episodes or series as well as live tours, merch and IP ownership for original programming. 
 
 In addition to our core business, we also built, own and operate a solution for the growing number of independent podcasters, Launchpad One. Launchpad One is a self-publishing podcast platform, created to provide a low or no cost tool for independent podcasters without access to parent podcasting networks or state of the art equipment to create shows. Launchpad One serves as a talent pool for us to find new podcasts and talent. 
 
 We have experienced significant growth in recent years driven by increased advertising activity. Our revenue was 25.3 million and 21.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 20 . 
 
 We are more than a podcast company. We are in the relationship business. Brands and creators partner with us to reach consumers who will purchase, listen and subscribe to their favorite PodcastOne podcasts across the audio landscape. We offer content for every type of listener with verticals including reality TV, sports, true crime self-help, and business. The visibility and reach of our network is evident with shows which consistently rank in the top 100 on the Apple Charts. 
 
 Recent Developments for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have continued to expand our slate of original programming, having acquired exclusive rights to certain podcasts, including ownership and intellectual property and derivative rights to several true crime podcasts for potential television and/or film projects and distribution. 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are actively pursuing potential other podcasts, shows and other asset acquisitions consistent with our strategy. 
 
 Our Business Model 
 
 We are an Ad-Supported Service that provides free content to listeners via their mobile and desktop devices. We generate revenue from the sale of audio, video and social advertising delivered through advertising impressions. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on our platform on behalf of the agencies clients. These advertising arrangements typically specify the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions in a stated period. Revenue for our Ad-Supported segment is affected primarily by the number of a show s listeners and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to our Ad-Supported Users and enhance returns for our advertising partners. Our advertising strategy centers on the belief that advertising products that are based on content and are relevant to the Ad-Supported User can enhance Ad-Supported Users experiences and provide even greater returns for advertisers through the strength of our host-read embedded promos. According to a Super Listener Survey in 2021, an estimated 49 of listeners believe the hosts actually use the products and services they recommend and 60 of podcast listeners say they have bought something from hearing a podcast ad. Offering advertisers additional ways to purchase advertising on a programmatic basis is another key way that we expand our portfolio of advertising products and enhance advertising revenue. Furthermore, we continue to focus on analytics and measurement tools to evaluate, demonstrate, and improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on our platform.

When we onboard new talent both parties have the common interest of creating content that advertisers want to purchase. We craft our deals with a percentage split of the advertising revenue (host-read embedded ads, DAI and programmatic) which strengthens our partnerships because when advertisers spend, we all win. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 We believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations. 
 
 Impressions 
 
 The digital advertising industry is introducing new ways to measure and price advertising inventory. For example, a significant portion of advertisers are in the process of moving from purchasing advertisement impressions based on the number of advertisements served by the applicable ad server to a new viewable impression standard (based on number of pixels in view and duration) for select products. In the absence of a uniform industry standard, agencies and advertisers have adopted several different measurement methodologies and standards. In addition, measurement services may require technological integrations, which are still being evaluated by the advertising industry without an agreed-upon industry standard metric. As these trends in the industry continue to evolve, our advertising revenue may be adversely affected by the availability, accuracy, and utility of the available analytics and measurement technologies as well as our ability to successfully implement and operationalize such technologies and standards. 
 
 Further, the digital advertising industry is shifting to data-driven technologies and advertising products, such as automated buying. These data-driven advertising products and automated buying technologies allow publishers and advertisers to use data to target advertising toward specific groups of users who are more likely to be interested in the advertising message delivered to them. These advertising products and programmatic technologies are currently more developed in terms of advertising technology and industry adoption on the web than they are on mobile or on other software applications, and may not integrate with our desktop software version of the ad-supported services. Because the majority of our ad-supported user hours occur on mobile devices, if we are unable to deploy effective solutions to monetize the mobile device usage by our ad-supported user base, our ability to attract advertising spend, and ultimately our advertising revenue, may be adversely affected by this shift. In addition, we rely on third-party advertising technology platforms to participate in automated buying, and if these platforms cease to operate or experience instability in their business models, it also may adversely affect our ability to capture advertising spend. 
 
 We generate revenue by charging a cost per thousand impressions CPM based on the volume of purchased digital ads that we measure on behalf of these customers. If the volume of impressions we measure does not continue to grow or decreases for any reason, our business will suffer. For example, if digital ad spending remains constant and our advertiser customers transition to higher CPM ad inventory, overall impression volumes may decrease, which may result in fewer impressions for us to verify and a corresponding decline in our revenues. 
 
 Podcast Services 
 
 Our podcasts are available to users online alongside LiveOne s digital Internet radio. Our users are able to listen to a variety of podcasts, from music, radio personalities, news, entertainment, comedy and sports. The podcasts are available on our platform, the LiveOne platforms and also on other leading podcast listening platforms, though various car manufacturers such as Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon. We monetize podcasts through paid advertising. We own one of the largest networks of podcast content in North America, which has over 300 exclusive podcast shows that produces over 182 episodes per week and has generated over 3.6 billion downloads during the year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 In addition to our core business, we also built, own and operate a solution for the growing number of independent podcasters, LaunchPadOne. LaunchPadOne is a self-publishing podcast platform, created to provide a low or no cost tool for independent podcasters without access to parent podcasting networks or state of the art equipment to create shows. LaunchPadOne serves as a talent pool for us to find new podcasts and talent.

Key Business Metric 
 
 We review various operating and financial metrics, including the number of podcasts downloaded to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. However, while we believe that other than the number of podcasts downloaded on our platform, such metrics do not materially help to evaluate our business, measure our performance or provide a better understanding of our results, our management uses its experience and understanding of the podcasting and advertising industry to evaluate such metrics, as well as CPM and various underlying podcast agreement terms (such as minimum guarantee payments, term, marketing spend) and others, such as advertiser engagement with a show, on a show by show basis and in totality across all shows on our network to predict our future business and financial performance. Accordingly, we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies who may calculate similarly-titled metrics in a different way, and provide the number of podcasts downloaded on our platform as the metric that we believe provides the best understanding of our results, as more fully discussed below.

The decrease in the number of podcast downloads is largely due to modified download behavior by Apple iOS 17 as it continues to be adopted by podcast listeners, as well as the departure of non-revenue generating partner networks from our podcast network. 
 
 Number of Podcast Downloads 
 
 We are an Ad-Supported Service that provides free content to listeners via their mobile and desktop devices. We generate revenue from the sale of audio, video and social advertising delivered through advertising impressions. We generally enter into arrangements with advertising agencies that purchase advertising on our platform on behalf of the agencies clients. These advertising arrangements typically specify the type of advertising product, pricing, insertion dates, and number of impressions in a stated period. Revenue for our Ad-Supported segment is affected primarily by the number of a show s listeners and our ability to provide innovative advertising products that are relevant to our Ad-Supported Users and enhance returns for our advertising partners. Therefore, we believe our ability to grow and measure our effectiveness of advertisers is dependent on tracking the number of podcast downloaded on our platform.

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue primarily from the sale of audio, video, and display advertising space to third-party advertising exchanges. Revenues are recognized based on delivery of impressions over the contract period to the third-party exchanges, either when an ad is placed for listening or viewing by a visitor or when the visitor clicks through on the advertisement. The advertising exchange companies report the variable advertising revenue performed on a monthly basis which represents our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation. We earn advertising revenues primarily for fees earned from advertisement placement purchased by the customer during the time the podcast is delivered to the viewing audience, under the terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable podcasting agreement calculated using impressions. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales consists of direct costs comprised of revenue sharing expenses owed to content creators and commissions. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Our operating expenses consist of cost of sales, product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and, in the case of sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Operating expenses also include an allocation of overhead costs for facilities and shared IT-related expenses. As we continue to invest in our business, we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in dollar amount, and although we believe our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease over the longer term, we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will increase in the short term as we invest in product innovation and sales growth and incur additional professional services and compliance costs as we operate as a public company. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and Marketing include direct and indirect costs related to our event advertising and marketing. Additionally, sales and marketing include merchandising advertising and royalty costs. Advertising expenses to promote our services are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Product Development 
 
 Product development costs not capitalized are primarily expenses for research and development, product and content development activities, including internal software development and improvement costs which have not been capitalized by us. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and Marketing include the direct and indirect costs related to our product and event advertising and marketing. Additionally, sales and marketing include merchandising advertising and royalty costs. Advertising expenses to promote our services are expensed as incurred.

Table of Contents 

General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations. These expenses also include non-personnel costs, such as outside legal, accounting, and other professional fees, software subscriptions, as well as certain tax, license, and insurance-related expenses, and allocated overhead costs. 
 
 We also recognized certain expenses as part of our transition to a publicly-traded company, consisting of professional fees and other expenses. In the quarters leading up to the listing of our common stock, we incurred professional fees and expenses, and in the quarter of our listing we incurred fees paid to our financial advisors in addition to other professional fees and expenses related to such listing. After the listing of our common stock, we continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). In addition, as a public company, we continue to incur additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, and investor relations. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future but to generally decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the longer term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and amount of our general and administrative expenses, including in the short term as we expect to incur increased compliance and professional service costs. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense and gain/losses on derivatives.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The following table presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, along with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for each period presented below. In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. See below for a description of the non-GAAP financial measures and their limitations as an analytical tool. A reconciliation is also provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Contribution Margin 
 
 Contribution Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Revenue less Cost of Sales. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) before (a) non-cash GAAP purchase accounting adjustments for certain deferred revenue and costs, (b) legal, accounting and other professional fees directly attributable to acquisition activity, (c) employee severance payments and third party professional fees directly attributable to acquisition or corporate realignment activities, (d) certain non-recurring expenses associated with legal settlements or reserves for legal settlements in the period that pertain to historical matters that existed at acquired companies prior to their purchase date, (e) depreciation and amortization (including goodwill and intangible asset impairment, if any), and (f) certain stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of our operating segment. We believe that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our business separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Revenue.

Limitations and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under U.S. GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Current Financial Condition 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 1.4 million, which primarily are invested in cash in banking institutions in the U.S. The vast majority of our cash proceeds were received as a result of our operations, completed private placement offering (the Bridge Loan of our unsecured convertible notes with an original issue discount of 10 (the OID in the aggregate principal amount of 8.8 million (the Bridge Notes ), which were converted in full in September 2023, and intercompany loans from our parent, LiveOne. As of September 30, 2024, we had a related party payable balance of 0.7 million. Our parent is required to maintain a minimum cash balance as a result of debt covenants on its debt. 
 
 On July 15, 2022, we completed a private placement offering of the Bridge Notes for gross proceeds of 8.0 million. In connection with the sale of the Bridge Notes, the holders of the Bridge Note received the Bridge Warrants, and we issued the Placement Agent Warrants to the placement agent. The Bridge Notes were scheduled to mature on July 15, 2023, subject to a one-time three-month extension at our election. We elected the extension and extended the maturity date to October 15, 2023. The Bridge Notes bore interest at a rate of 10 per annum payable on maturity. On September 8, 2023, we completed our direct listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (our spin-out from LiveOne to become a standard publicly trading company) and as a result of the direct listing, all of the remaining Bridge Notes (including interest thereunder) in the aggregate amount of approximately 7.02 million converted into approximately 2,341,000 shares of our common stock. 
 
 In August 2023, LiveOne entered into a 1.7 million secured loan with Capchase which accrues interest at 8 and matures 30 months form issuance (the Capchase Loan ). On September 8, 2023 and effective as of August 22, 2023, LiveOne entered into a new Business Loan Agreement with the senior credit facility provider to convert the senior credit facility into an assets backed loan credit facility, which shall continue to be collateralized by a first lien on all of the assets of LiveOne and its subsidiaries (the ABL Credit Facility ). The Business Loan Agreement provides LiveOne with borrowing capacity of up to the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Business Loan Agreement). Pursuant to the Business Loan Agreement, the requirement that LiveOne and its related entities shall at all times maintain a certain minimum deposit with the senior credit facility provider was reduced from 7,000,000 to 5,000,000. In November 2024, LiveOne repaid 1.0 million of the principal amount underlying the ABL Credit Facility and accordingly decreased the size of the facility to 6.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, LiveOne was in compliance with all covenants under the Capchase Loan and the ABL Credit Facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, LiveOne s total outstanding consolidated indebtedness was 8.1 million, net of fees and discounts, which consisted of ABL Credit Facility and the Capchase Loan. The ABL Credit Facility documents contain a covenant that if a material adverse change occurs in its financial condition, or such lender reasonably believes the prospect of payment or performance of their loan is materially impaired, the lender at its option may immediately accelerate their debt and require LiveOne to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder. For example, if for any reason LiveOne fails to comply with the terms of its settlement agreement with SoundExchange, its senior credit facility provider may declare an event of default and at its option may immediately accelerate its debt and require LiveOne and/or us to repay all outstanding amounts owed under the senior credit facility, which would materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, LiveOne announced an amended relationship with our largest OEM customer. The OEM customer will no longer subsidize our products to some of its customers, however, LiveOne will offer all OEM customer vehicles in North America the opportunity to convert to become direct subscribers of LiveOne s LiveOne music app. The direct subscription to the LiveOne app will allow such users for the first time to access their LiveOne music and LiveOne s other service offerings directly across all of their devices. LiveOne s music streaming button/icon, which allows users to directly connect their subscription to LiveOne, is expected to remain in the OEM customer s music streaming services dashboard in perpetuity. The OEM customer will continue to pay LiveOne monthly for grandfathered vehicles for the term of the OEM license agreement. Accordingly, the change in LiveOne s relationship with the OEM customer in October 2024 is likely to cause its liquidity and cash flows to fluctuate significantly beyond September 30, 2024, which may then have an impact on our liquidity and potentially cause our liquidity to fluctuate significantly beyond September 30, 2024. LiveOne s liquidity will depend upon its ability to convert as many of the OEM drivers as possible to become direct subscribers of its LiveOne app and the OEM customer continuing to pay for any grandfather users, as well as LiveOne s ability to enter into new B2B agreements to provide its services that could materially contribute its our liquidity and cash flows, which may then have an impact on our liquidity and potentially cause our liquidity to fluctuate significantly. In addition, LiveOne s liquidity will depend on its ability to negotiate with its music labels, publishers and other partners to achieve flexibility in the terms of its license agreements to match our OEM driver conversions, which may then have an impact on our liquidity and potentially cause our liquidity to fluctuate significantly. Furthermore, LiveOne s liquidity will be dependent on its ability to extend and/or refinance the terms of its senior secured line of credit and/or its ability to pay any amounts that LiveOne has agreed to pay under the SX Settlement Agreement, which may then have an impact on our liquidity and potentially cause our liquidity to fluctuate significantly. 
 
 We are looking to secure additional interim financing in the immediate future, which is needed to continue our current level of operations in the future and satisfy our obligations. In the absence of additional sources of liquidity, management anticipates that existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet current operating and liquidity needs beyond November 2025. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional liquidity or be successful in raising additional funds or that such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms, or at all, or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. In addition, management is unable to determine at this time whether any of these potential sources of liquidity will be adequate to support our future business operations. While we do not currently anticipate delays or hindrances to our current business operations and initiatives schedule due to liquidity constraints, without additional funding we may not be able to continue our current level of business operations in the future.

As reflected in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we have a history of losses and had working capital of 0.7 million as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit report to our financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our strategy and on our ability to raise additional funds through the sale of equity and/or debt securities via public and/or private offerings. 
 
 Our long-term ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to increase revenue, reduce costs, achieve a satisfactory level of profitable operations, and obtain additional sources of suitable and adequate financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent its ability to further develop and execute on our business plan. We may also have to reduce certain overhead costs through the reduction of salaries and other means and settle liabilities through negotiation. There can be no assurance that management s attempts at any or all of these endeavors will be successful.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation (the Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on July 1, 2024 (the Annual Report ), our President (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are from time to time, party to various legal proceedings arising out of our business. Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and are incorporated herein by reference. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I-Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the risk factors that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 except as noted below. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 
 We have incurred significant operating and net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 As reflected in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we have a history of losses, incurred significant operating and net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of 14.7 million and 7.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and cash provided by(used in) operating activities of 2.2 million and (4.7) million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had cash provided by operating activities of 0.1 million and 0.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred a net loss of 3.0 million and 11.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 32.6 million and a working capital of 0.7 million. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time that we can generate significant increases to our revenues, and/or reduce our operating costs and losses. To date, we have financed our operations exclusively through the sale of equity securities (including convertible securities), and after our acquisition by LiveOne on July 1, 2020, through LiveOne s sale of its and our equity and/or debt securities (including convertible securities). The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to significantly grow our business and increase our revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we grow our business. We also expect an increase in our expenses associated with our operations as a publicly-traded company. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of other reasons, including unsuccessful acquisitions, costs of integrating new businesses, expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. 
 
 Our ability to meet our total liabilities of 7.6 million as of September 30, 2024, and to continue as a going concern, is dependent on our ability to increase revenue, reduce costs, achieve a satisfactory level of profitable operations, obtain additional sources of suitable and adequate financing and further develop and execute on our business plan. We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable. As a result of the going concern uncertainty, there is an increased risk that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company, which assumes the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 
 
 If LiveOne does not comply with the provisions of its ABL Credit Facility and/or the Capchase Loan, its senior lenders may terminate its obligations to LiveOne and require LiveOne and/or us to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder. 
 
 LiveOne s ABL Credit Facility and the Capchase Loan contain certain provisions that limit its and our operating activities, including the ABL Credit Facility containing a covenant relating to the requirement to maintain a certain amount cash (as provided in the ABL Credit Facility loan agreement). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the ABL Credit Facility lender and/or Capchase may among other things, terminate their obligations thereunder, accelerate their debt and require LiveOne and/or us to repay all amounts thereunder. For example, on October 13, 2022, a judgement was entered in favor of SoundExchange, Inc. SX against LiveOne and Slacker in the United States District Court Central District of California in the amount of approximately 9.8 million. On February 3, 2023, LiveOne and Slacker entered into an agreement (the "SX Settlement Agreement") to settle the dispute with SX and related court judgement entered against the defendants, pursuant to which LiveOne agreed to make certain monthly payments to SX for a period of 24 months and certain other payments in the event LiveOne obtains additional financing(s), unless LiveOne or Slacker repays the judgment amount earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement, and SX agreed not to take any action to enforce such judgment, so long as the defendants are not in default under the agreement. LiveOne s debt agreements with the ABL Credit Facility lender contains a covenant that if a material adverse change occurs in its financial condition, or such lender reasonably believes the prospect of payment or performance of their loan is materially impaired, the lender at its option may immediately accelerate their debt and require LiveOne to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder. If for any reason LiveOne fails to comply with the terms of the SX Settlement Agreement, its ABL Credit Facility lender may declare an event of default and at its option may immediately accelerate its debt and require LiveOne and/or us to repay all outstanding amounts owed under the ABL Credit Facility and which would then allow Capchase to declare a default under their loan agreement with us, which would materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. In the event LiveOne fails to make any payment of any principal of, or interest or premium on, any indebtedness owed to the ABL Credit Facility lender, Capchase would have the right to declare a default under its loan agreement with LiveOne. As of September 30, 2024, LiveOne was in compliance with all covenants under the Capchase Loan and the ABL Credit Facility.

We may be subject to risks associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. 
 
 Recent technological advances in artificial intelligence AI and machine learning technology may pose risks to us. Our use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action, create liabilities, or materially harm our business. While we aim to develop and use AI and machine learning technology responsibly and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. Further, as the technology is rapidly evolving, costs and obligations could be imposed on us to comply with new regulations. 
 
 We also could be exposed to the risks of machine learning technology if third-party service providers or any counterparties, whether or not known to us, also use machine learning technology in their business activities. We will not be in a position to control the use of such technology in third-party products or services. Use by third-party service providers could give rise to issues pertaining to data privacy, data protection, and intellectual property considerations. 
 
 Increased data protection regulation may result in increased complexities and risk in connection with the operation of our business and our products. 
 
 Our business is highly dependent on information systems and technology. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Cybersecurity has become a priority for regulators in the U.S. and around the world. Recently, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and periodic disclosure of a registrant s cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance in annual reports. The rules became effective beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023, beginning with Form 8-Ks on December 18, 2023. The SEC has also particularly focused on cybersecurity, and we expect increased scrutiny of our policies and systems designed to manage our cybersecurity risks and our related disclosures as a result. We also expect to face increased costs to comply with the new SEC rules, including increased costs for cybersecurity training and management. The SEC has indicated in recent periods that one of its examination priorities for the Division of Examinations is to continue to examine cybersecurity procedures and controls, including testing the implementation of these procedures and controls. 
 
 There may be substantial financial penalties or fines for breach of privacy laws (which may include insufficient security for our personal or other sensitive information). Non-compliance with any applicable privacy or data security laws represents a serious risk to our business. Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal information. Breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our or our stockholders or counterparties confidential or other information processed and stored in, or transmitted through, our computer systems and networks (or those of our third-party vendors), or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our stockholders or our counterparties or third parties operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our stockholders and other counterparties, fines or penalties, litigation, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, which could also lead to loss of stockholders. 
 
 Finally, there has been significant evolution and developments in the use of AI technologies. We cannot fully determine the impact or cybersecurity risk of such evolving technology to our business at this time. 
 
 If we do not respond to technological innovations or changes or upgrade our technology systems, our growth prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality, features and security of our technology infrastructure. Infrastructure upgrades may require significant capital investment outside of the normal course of business. In the future, we will likely need to improve and upgrade our technology, database systems and network infrastructure to allow our business to grow in both size and scope. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our ability to provide rapid customer service. We may face significant delays in introducing new services or developing new technologies. Moreover, if we do not keep pace with the rapid innovations and changes taking place in information technology in our industry, we could be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, the rapid dissemination and increasing transparency of information, particularly for public companies, increases the risks to our business that could result from negative media or announcements about ethics lapses, improper behavior or other operational problems, which could lead clients to terminate or reduce their relationships with us. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies, our proprietary technology and systems may become less competitive, and our business may be harmed. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that our business will improve.

Risks Related to Our Company 
 
 For the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective due to the existence of material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during such periods. While such weaknesses were subsequently remediated, if we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis or prevent fraud could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected. 
 
 Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet PodcastOne s reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by our Company conducted in connection with Section 404, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, if and when required, may reveal additional deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. For our fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our management conducted an assessment of its disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that they were ineffective for each of such periods, due to the existence of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which were subsequently remediated. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 
 
 If we are unable to establish and maintain proper and effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Relationship with LiveOne and its Indebtedness 
 
 LiveOne may not have the ability to repay the amounts then due under its ABL Credit Facility, Capchase Loan and/or SX Settlement Agreement. 
 
 At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of LiveOne s senior secured ABL Credit Facility, will become due and payable by LiveOne. As of September 30, 2024, 8.1 million of LiveOne s total indebtedness is due in fiscal 2025. LiveOne s failure to repay any outstanding amount of its ABL Credit Facility would constitute a default under such facility. A default would increase the interest rate to the default rate under the ABL Credit Facility or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until such amount is paid in full and may materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the SX Settlement Agreement, LiveOne and Slacker are required to pay SX the amount of 9,765,396.70 in equal monthly payments, subject to increase in the event LiveOne or Slacker complete certain future financings, with a final payment of 2,189,775.08 on or before February 1, 2025, unless the parties agree to further extend the timing of such payment. If for any reason LiveOne or Slacker fail to comply with the terms of the SX settlement agreement, the final payment will increase by 925,391.40, and SX will have the right to declare a default under the SX Settlement Agreement and at its option require LiveOne and Slacker to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder and/or enforce its consent judgment and/or pursue a new judgment against LiveOne and Slacker, which may materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. As of September 30, 2024, LiveOne and Slacker owed 4.9 million to SX under the SX Settlement Agreement. 
 
 A default under the ABL Credit Facility could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, LiveOne may not have sufficient funds to repay its ABL Credit Facility, the Capchase Loan or make cash payments thereon. Furthermore, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default, the ABL Credit Facility provider shall have the right to, among other things, take possession of LiveOne s, our Company s and LiveOne s and our respective subsidiaries assets and property constituting the collateral thereunder and the right to assign, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default under the Capchase Loan, Capchase shall have the right to, among other things, take possession of certain assets and property of LiveOne constituting the collateral thereunder and the right to assign, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such collateral.

Table of Contents 

LiveOne s debt agreements contain restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility, and LiveOne s substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business. 
 
 LiveOne has a significant amount of indebtedness. Its total outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 was 8.1 million, net of fees and discounts. In addition, while LiveOne has certain restrictions and covenants with its current indebtedness, LiveOne could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond such amount. LiveOne s existing debt agreements with the senior lenders contain certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, make certain investments, pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, transfer or dispose of assets, or enter into various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of LiveOne s senior secured lenders or terminate our existing debt agreements. LiveOne s debt agreements under the ABL Credit Facility also contain certain financial covenants, including maintaining a minimum cash amount at all times and are secured by substantially all of our assets. There is no guarantee that LiveOne, our Company and LiveOne s other subsidiaries will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest under our debt agreements or to satisfy all of the financial covenants. We may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. 
 
 LiveOne s substantial debt combined with its and our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other significant adverse consequences, including: 

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on, and principal of, LiveOne s debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes; 

increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions; 

obligating us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing; 

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and 

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options. 

LiveOne intends to satisfy its current and future debt service obligations with its and our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds from external sources, including its and/or its subsidiaries' equity and/or debt financing. However, LiveOne and its subsidiaries (including our Company) may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments as a result of an event of default, including upon the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, properties, assets or condition or a failure to pay any amount due, LiveOne and/or our Company may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay LiveOne s and/or our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Issuance of Unregistered Securities 
 
 Other than as set forth below and as reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K, there have been no other sales or issuances of unregistered securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 234,428 shares of our common stock valued at 0.4 million to various consultants. We valued these shares at prices between 0.96 and 2.22 per share, the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 137,710 shares of our common stock valued at 0.2 million to employees. We valued these shares at prices between 0.89 and 4.39 per share, the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 424,000 shares of our common stock valued at 0.7 million to Live One, Inc. We valued these share prices between 1.50 and 2.00 per share. 
 
 We believe the offers, sales and issuances of the securities described above were made in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder and involved a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. Each of the recipients of securities in any transaction exempt from registration either received or had adequate access, through employment, business or other relationships, to information about us.
