INVESTCORP EUROPE ACQUISITION CORP I 

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL 

STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

. On October 7, 2021, the Company changed its name to Investcorp Europe Acquisition Corp I (the Company ). The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets (the Business Combination ). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 22, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation and Initial Public Offering of units (the IPO described below, and since the IPO, the search for a target business. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company expects to generate non-operating
 income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds expected to be derived from the IPO. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 
 The registration statement for the Company s IPO was declared effective on December 14, 2021 (the Effective Date ). On December 17, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of units, which included the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option of units (the Units and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the Public Shares at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of , which is discussed further in Note 3. 

 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants ), at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Europe Acquisition Holdings Limited (the Sponsor ), generating proceeds of . 

 Following the closing of the IPO on December 17, 2021, per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account Trust Account ), located in the United States at a nationally recognized financial institution, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company Continental acting as trustee. Prior to December 14, 2023, funds in the Trust Account were held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ). However, to mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), prior to the 24-month
 anniversary of the Effective Date of the registration statement relating to the Company s IPO, the Company instructed Continental to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest bearing account until the earlier of consummation of its initial Business Combination or liquidation. In connection with such instructions, on December 14, 2023, the Company and Continental entered into an amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement dated December 11, 2021 (the Trust Agreement ), which governs the investment of monies held in the Trust Account, to specifically allow the investment of those funds into an interest-bearing
 account. 
 Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Articles to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the time frame to consummate the business combination period (the Business Combination Period as defined in its Articles or during any extended time that the Company has to consummate a Business Combination as a result of a shareholder vote to amend its Articles (an Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-Business
 Combination activity; and (iii) absent an initial Business Combination within the Business Combination Period or Extension Period from the closing of the IPO, the return of the funds held in the Trust Account to the Company s public shareholders as part of the redemption of the Public Shares. 
 If the Company has not consummated the initial Business Combination within the required time period, the public shareholders may receive only approximately per Public Share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of the Trust Account and the warrants will expire worthless. 

 If the Company seeks shareholder approval to proceed with a Business Combination, a majority of the shares voted in favor of the Business Combination would be required. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Articles, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will 

or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

 The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Extension Period and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Articles (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial
 business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 
 The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Extension Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Extension Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 11) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Extension Period; and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than 10.20 per Public Share. 

 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) 10.20 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.20 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

 Extraordinary General Meetings 

On March 14, 2023, the Company convened an extraordinary general meeting (the First Extraordinary General Meeting virtually, to vote on the proposals described below. A total of of the Company s Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares (the Ordinary Shares ), or of the Company s outstanding shares as of February 22, 2023, the record date for the First Extraordinary General Meeting, were represented virtually or by proxy at the First Extraordinary General Meeting. 

 As approved by its shareholders at the First Extraordinary Meeting, the Company filed an amendment (the First Extension Amendment ), which (i) extended the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from March 17, 2023 to December 17, 2023 and (ii) removed the limitation that the Company shall not redeem public shares to the extent that such redemption would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less than (the Redemption Limitation Amendment ). 

 Additionally, at the First Extraordinary General Meeting holders of Public Shares were afforded the opportunity to require the Company to redeem their Public Shares for their pro rata share of the Trust Account. In connection with the vote to approve the First Extension Amendment and the Redemption Limitation Amendment, the holders of Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million, leaving Public Shares remaining outstanding. Following this redemption, the balance in the Trust Account was approximately million. 

 In connection with the approval of the First Extension Amendment, the Sponsor had agreed, by making monthly advancements on the March 2023 Loan (as defined below), to contribute (each such contribution, an Extension Contribution into the Trust Account the lesser of (x) an aggregate of or (y) per share for each public share that was not redeemed at the First Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period (commencing on March 17, 2023 and ending on the 17th day of each subsequent month), or prior thereof, until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and December 17, 2023. 

or (y) per share for each Class A ordinary share included as part of the Units sold in the Company s IPO (including any shares issued in exchange thereof) that were not redeemed at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period (commencing on December 17, 2023 and ending on the 17th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and June 17, 2024. 

 Additionally, at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting holders of Public Shares were afforded the opportunity to require the Company to redeem their Public Shares for their pro rata share of the Trust Account. The holders of Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million, leaving Public Shares remaining outstanding. 

 On May 21, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the Third Extraordinary General Meeting to vote on a proposal to approve an Amendment to the Company s Articles extending the date by which the Company must complete its initial Business Combination from June 17, 2024 to December 17, 2024 (the Third Extension Amendment Proposal and with respect to December 17, 2024, the Extended Date ), and the stockholders approved the Third Extension Amendment Proposal at that meeting. In connection with the vote to approve the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, the holders of Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of per share. In connection with this redemption, approximately million was withdrawn from the Trust Account to fund such redemptions. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had made nine Extension Contribution payments pursuant to the March 2023 Loan, the July 2023 Loan and the November 2023 Loan (as defined below), each in the amount of , as well as six Extension Contribution Payments pursuant to the Second November 2023 Loan and the April 2024 Loan, each in the amount of . For a more detailed description of the Loans, see Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern. In connection with the Third Extension, the Company ceased making Extension Contributions on June 17, 2024. 

 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank accounts and working capital of . As of September 30, 2024, approximately of the amount on deposit in cash held in the Trust Account represented interest income and represented an Extension Contribution, all of which are available to pay the Company s tax obligations, if any. 

 The Company s liquidity needs up to December 17, 2021 had been satisfied through a payment from the Sponsor of (see Note 6) for the Founder Shares to cover certain offering costs and the loan under an unsecured promissory note from the Sponsor of up to . In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans, as defined below (see Note 6). As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 

 On March 7, 2023, the Company entered into a non-interest
 bearing convertible unsecured loan (the March 2023 Loan in the principal amount of up to from one of the Sponsor s affiliates to provide the Company with additional working capital and to fund the Extension Contributions. The portion of the March 2023 Loan used to provide the Company with additional working capital was not deposited into the Trust Account. If the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination by the Extension Period, the March 2023 Loan will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The March 2023 Loan is convertible into Private Placement Warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The conversion option represents an embedded derivative under ASC 815-15,
 Embedded Derivatives. The Company has determined that based on the valuation of its Private Placement Warrants and the fact that a Business Combination is not considered probable until such time as it is consummated, the value of this conversion option is de minimis. 
 In addition, on July 6, 2023, November 15, 2023, November 27, 2023, April 15, 2024 and June 6, 2024, the Company entered into non-interest
 bearing unsecured loans in the principal amount of up to (the July 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to (the November 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to (the Second November 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to (the April 2024 Loan ), and in the principal amount of up to (the June 2024 Loan and, together with the March 2023 Loan, the July 2023 Loan, the November 2023 Loan, the Second November 2023 Loan and the April 2024 Loan, the Loans with an affiliate of the Sponsor to provide the Company with additional working capital and to fund Extension Contributions into the Trust Account until the earlier of a completion of the Business Combination or the Extended Date. The July 2023 Loan, the November 2023 Loan, the Second November 2023 Loan, the April 2024 Loan and the June 2024 Loan bear no interest and shall be due and payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (ii) the date of that the winding up of the Company is effective. If the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination by the Extended Date, the July 2023 Loan, the November 2023 Loan, the Second November 2023 Loan, the April 2024 Loan and the June 2024 Loan will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. If at any time the board of directors of the Company determines that the Company will not be able to consummate an initial Business Combination by the Extended Date and that the Company shall instead liquidate, the Sponsor s obligation to continue to make the Extension Contributions shall cease immediately upon such determination. 

and , respectively. 

 On August 1, 2024, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq indicating that since the Company s aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants was less than million, the Company was no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing criteria set forth in Listing Rule 5452(b)(C), which requires the Company to maintain an aggregate market value of its outstanding warrants of at least million (the Notice ). The Notice additionally indicates that the Company, pursuant to the Listing Rules, has calendar days, or until September 16, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance. If Nasdaq accepts the Company s plan, the Company will have calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until January 29, 2025, to evidence compliance. If Nasdaq were to reject the Company s plan, Nasdaq rules permit the Company to appeal the decision to a hearings panel.

Warrant Liabilities 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s warrant liabilities were valued at . Under the guidance in ASC 815-40,
 the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. As such, the Public Warrants and the Private Warrants must be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. This valuation is subject to re-measurement
 at each balance sheet date. With each re-measurement,
 the valuations will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statement of operations. 
 The Company s public warrant liability is based on the closing price as of the last date of the reporting period as the public warrants are publicly traded. 

 The Company s private warrant liability is based on a valuation model utilizing management judgment and pricing inputs from observable and unobservable markets with less volume and transaction frequency than active markets. Significant deviations from these estimates and inputs could result in a material change in fair value. The fair value of the warrant liabilities is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

 The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants were determined using Level 3 inputs. The Monte Carlo simulation utilizes certain known inputs such as the Company s stock price, the warrant exercise price, the time to expiration and the fact that there is a call condition. The risk- free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury curve. The expected life of the instruments are assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term plus the amount of time assumed to consummate a Business Combination. Additionally, inherent in a Monte Carlo simulation model is an assumption related to the unknown expected share-price volatility. The Company estimates the implied volatility of its warrants based on the volatility required to produce a model price equal to the market price for the Company s Public Warrants.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on March 22, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial Business Combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. The issuance of additional shares in connection with a Business Combination to the owners of the target or other investors: 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our IPO, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants. Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. On September 24, 2024, the Company terminated the Business Combination Agreement with Zacco Holdings (formerly OpSec Holdings). Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company received a Termination Amount of 30 million, and on October 22, 2024, the Company s Board declared a distribution of the net amount of such Termination Payment after satisfaction of the Company s liabilities pro rata to all holders of Class A Ordinary Shares, equal to .60 per Class A Ordinary Share. The distribution was paid on or about November 12, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 4, 2024. The Company is currently considering whether to seek an alternative business combination or dissolve. Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and activities related to searching for a target for our Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 7,576,235, which consisted of a 8,556,750 loss on the fair value of warrant liabilities, 7,653,872 in formation and operating costs and a loss on exchange rate of 4,595, offset by 8,638,982 in interest income on Marketable Securities held in Trust Account. The high level of operating costs in the three month and nine month periods reflects due diligence work related to evaluating the business combination ahead of the announcement in April 2023, legal expenses related to finalizing the Business Combination Agreement and additional legal expenses related to the business combination in the period since the Business Combination Agreement was signed. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity needs have been satisfied through receipt of 25,000 from the sale of the Founder Shares to our Sponsor to cover for certain expenses on our behalf in exchange for the issuance of the 8,625,000 Founder Shares, and the loans entered into in the principal amount of up to 2,000,000 (the March 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 1,700,000 (the July 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 500,000 (the November 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 1,250,000 (the Second November 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 750,000 (the April 2024 Loan ), and in the principal amount of up to 1,200,000 (the June 2024 Loan, and collectively, the Loans with an affiliate of the Sponsor to provide the Company with additional working capital and to fund Extension Contributions into the Trust Account until the earlier of a completion of a Business Combination or the extended date of December 17, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were provided 9,134,926 in operating activities, which was largely driven by 37,091,762 in net income and a 32,759 increase in prepaid expenses, offset by a 10,423,621 receivable related to the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, 7,432,000 related to change in fair value on warrant liabilities, 3,835,521 in interest earned on Cash held in Trust Account, 4,346,926 in forgiveness of legal fees and a 1,461,877 decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were provided 23,692,454 in investing activities, which was driven by 750,000 in Extension Contributions and 24,442,454 in payments for redemptions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized 22,292,454 in financing activities, which was driven by 24,442,454 in payments made to shareholders for redemption, offset by 2,150,000 in proceeds from a Loan from the Sponsor. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we utilized 1,312,957 in operating activities, which was largely driven by an increase of 5,869,231 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, 476,279 in Prepaid and other as well as a 8,556,750 change in fair value of our warrant liabilities, offset by 8,638,982 in interest earned on our marketable securities held in the Trust Account and a net loss of 7,576,235. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we were provided 159,156,370 from our investing activities, which was primarily driven by 161,606,370 redemptions as a result of our extraordinary shareholder meeting offset by 2,450,000 in Extension Contributions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we utilized 158,291,370 in our financing activities, which was the result of the 161,606,370 payout of redemptions by our shareholders offset by 3,315,000 in proceeds from our promissory note. The net proceeds from the sale of the Units in our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of 16,700,000, after deducting offering expenses of 1,103,227 and underwriting commissions of 6,900,000 (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of 12,075,000), was 351,900,000, which is held in the Trust Account and includes the deferred underwriting commissions described above. The proceeds held in the Trust Account are invested in an interest-bearing account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or liquidation. Our shareholders have exercised their right of redemption in the amount of 268,092,426, which left 107,909,011 in proceeds and interest earned in the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024. As of November 19, 2024, a total of 108,250,427 was held in the Trust Account. This value reflects the approximately 24.4 million that was withdrawn for the redemptions that have occurred in the Third Extraordinary General Meeting. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions) net of any redemptions, to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes, if any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

Table of Contents 

Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, as of September 30, 2024, we have available to us 10,633,602 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account, as well as any funds from loans from our Sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team. We will use these funds to primarily identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. If our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. On March 7, 2023, we entered into a non-interest bearing convertible unsecured loan (the March 2023 Loan in the principal amount of up to 2,000,000 from one of our Sponsor s affiliates to provide us with additional working capital and to fund the initial Contributions described below. The portion of the March 2023 Loan used to provide us with additional working capital was not deposited into our Trust Account. If we do not consummate an initial Business Combination by the Extended Date, the March 2023 Loan will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The March 2023 Loan is convertible into private placement warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The conversion option represents an embedded derivative under ASC 815-15, Embedded Derivatives. The Company has determined that based on the valuation of its Private Placement Warrants and the fact that a Business Combination is not considered probable until such time as it is consummated, the value of this conversion option is de minimis. In addition, on July 6, 2023, November 15, 2023, November 27, 2023, April 15, 2024 and June 6, 2024, the Company entered into non-interest bearing unsecured loans in the principal amount of up to 1,700,000 (the July 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 500,000 (the November 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 1,250,000 (the Second November 2023 Loan ), in the principal amount of up to 750,000 the April 2024 Loan ), and in the principal amount of up to 1,200,000 (the June 2024 Loan, together with the March 2023 Loan, the July 2023 Loan, the November 2023 Loan, the Second November 2023 Loan, and the April 2024 Loan, the Loans with an affiliate of the Sponsor to fund Extension Contribution payments into the Trust Account until the earlier of a completion of the Business Combination of the Extended Date. The portion of the Loans used to provide the company with additional working capital are not deposited into the Trust Account. The total amount outstanding under the Loans was 6,900,000 and 4,750,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On March 14, 2023, we convened the First Extraordinary General Meeting virtually, at which our Sponsor agreed, by making monthly advancements on the March 2023 Loan, to contribute the Extension Contribution of lesser of (x) an aggregate of 350,000 or (y) 0.03 per share for each public share that was not redeemed at the First Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period (commencing on March 17, 2023 and ending on the 17th day of each subsequent month), or prior thereof, until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and the end of the Extension Period. On December 5, 2023, we convened the Second Extraordinary General Meeting virtually, at which our Sponsor agreed, by making monthly advancements on the Loans, to contribute Extension Contributions into the Trust Account the lesser of (x) an aggregate of 150,000 or (y) 0.02 per share for each Public Share that was not redeemed at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period (commencing on December 17, 2023 and ending on the 17th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and the Extended Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate Extension contributions to the Trust Account shall not exceed 900,000 based on up to six monthly Extension Contributions through the Extended Date. On May 21, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the Third Extraordinary General Meeting to vote on a proposal to approve an Amendment to the Company s Articles extending the date by which the Company must complete its initial Business Combination from June 17, 2024 to December 17, 2024 (the Third Extension Amendment Proposal and with respect to December 17, 2024, the Extended Date ), and the shareholders approved the Third Extension Amendment Proposal at that meeting. In connection with the vote to approve the third Extension Amendment Proposal, the holders of 2,159,610 Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of 11.32 per share. In connection with these redemptions, approximately 24.4 million was withdrawn from the Trust Account to fund such redemptions. We expect our future primary liquidity requirements during the period until the Business Combination to include legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful Business Combinations; legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; Nasdaq and other regulatory fees; consulting, travel and miscellaneous expenses incurred during the search for initial Business Combination target; and general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves.

In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed Business Combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific Business Combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. If we are not able to consummate our Business Combination before the end of the Business Combination Period, we will commence an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation. Management has determined that automatic liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution also raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While management intends to complete a Business Combination, it is uncertain whether we will be able to do so. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities. These conditions, including the working capital deficit and proximity to the end of our Extension Period, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. There is no assurance that our plan to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Business Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Controls and Procedures We are required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer an emerging growth company would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. We will assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. Many small and mid-sized target businesses we may consider for our initial Business Combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as: 

staffing for financial, accounting and external reporting areas, including segregation of duties; 

reconciliation of accounts; 

proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate; 

evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions; 

documentation of processes, assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates; and 

documentation of accounting policies and procedures. Because it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business, we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Commitments and Contractual Obligations Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights and shareholder agreement to be signed prior to or on the Effective Date of the IPO, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to Class A ordinary shares). The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders will have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Underwriting Agreement The underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 12,075,000 in the aggregate with each entitled to 6,037,500. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On June 10, 2024, one of the Company s underwriters resigned and provided a waiver of expenses and fees. Accordingly, the Company reversed the 6,037,500 liability, which represented their portion of the full 12,075,000. On September 24, 2024, the Business Combination was terminated. Accordingly, the remaining 6,037,500 was reversed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 0 and 12,075,000 accrued for deferred underwriting fees, respectively. Consulting Agreements In April 2023, the Company entered into two agreements with each of the IPO underwriters, each to act as a capital markets advisor and as a placement agent in relation to the Business Combination. On June 9, 2023, the Company terminated the two engagement letters with one of the IPO underwriters, and such termination nullified the Company s obligation to pay any fees under such agreements. With respect to the other IPO underwriter, as compensation for their services, half of a placement fee of 3.0 of the gross proceeds of securities sold in the placement was to be paid to the agent upon consummation of the placement (the Placement Fee and 4,000,000 was to be paid to the agent upon consummation of the Business Combination (the Transaction Fee ). The Placement Fee and the Transaction fee would only have become payable in the event the placement and the Business Combination were consummated, respectively, and as such nothing will be recorded until that time. On June 10, 2024, the other IPO underwriter resigned and waived the obligation to any fees. As such, the Placement and Transaction Fees will not become payable. In June 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a third-party consultant to provide advisory services in relation to the Business Combination. On July 15, 2024, the Company terminated the agreement with the third-party consultant and entered into a new agreement with the third- party consultant. As a result, and as compensation for those services, an advisory fee of 3,000,000 is payable in the event the transaction is consummated (the Advisory Fee ). This fee will only become payable in the event the Business Combination is consummated and as such nothing will be recorded until that time. Additionally, the consultant was eligible to receive a termination fee of 500,000 and to be reimbursed in the aggregate up to 500,000 in expenses in the event the Business Combination is not consummated. As part of the termination of the initial agreement, the consultant billed 1,195,643 in connection with its fees incurred. This balance was included in the Additional Specified Transaction Expenses (see Note 7). JOBS Act The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the report of the independent registered public accounting firm providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of the end of the reporting period, we consider our critical accounting estimates to the fair value of our warrants and convertible promissory note.

Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements. We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ). The update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20, Debt- Debt with Conversion and Other Options for convertible instruments and introducing other changes. As a result of ASU No. 2020-06, more convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost and more convertible preference shares will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at historical cost, as long as no features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 upon inception. The impact to the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows was not material. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 7240) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, ASU 2023-09 in order to enhance the transparency and usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance is applicable to all entities subject to income tax and it will require disclosure of certain categories within the rate reconciliation to improve consistency as well as disclosure of reconciling items which meet a certain quantitative threshold which will improve transparency. Additionally, entities must disclose the amount of taxes paid to federal, state and foreign municipalities. For public business entities ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects to adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. The company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. We have considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on the current information. Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any material market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our IPO, the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement, including amounts in the Trust Account, were invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Prior to December 14, 2023, funds in the Trust Account were held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. However, to mitigate the risk of the Company being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment company Act), prior to the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Date of the registration statement relating to the Company s IPO, the company instructed Continental to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest bearing account until the earlier of consummation of its initial Business Combination or liquidation. In connection with such instructions, on December 14, 2023, the company and Continental entered into an amendment to the Trust Agreement, which governs the investment of monies held in the Trust Account, to specifically allow the investment of those funds into an interest-bearing account. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there was no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

We have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this quarterly report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer (our Certifying Officers evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with lack of controls to assure the accuracy and completeness of accrued expenses, classification and presentation of forgiveness of accrued legal expenses as other income and interest earned in the Trust Account, and proper classification of de-recognition of liabilities between income and components of equity. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we concluded that our controls over recognition of accrued expenses were not effectively designed of maintained. Our management performance additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the periods presented. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management team, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In light of the material weakness described above our management team has performed additional accounting and financial analyses and other post-closing procedures. We have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, our internal controls and procedures. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we plan to continue to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. In light of the material weakness described above, our management team has performed additional accounting and financial analyses and other post-closing procedures. We have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, internal controls and procedures. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant of unusual transactions, we plan to continue to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards.
