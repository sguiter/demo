per share Common Stock have been listed on The Nasdaq
Capital Market since September 29, 2021. 

The Company develops and operates digital infrastructure
platforms for enterprise customers and for its own purposes. The Company s digital infrastructure platforms can be used to operate
computing resources for a number of applications, and are offered across digital assets, artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance
computing (HPC) and other computing applications. The Company also has an energy management business, which utilizes software and analysis,
to generate revenue when the Company adapts its power usage to the real-time needs of the grid. The Company may also transact in digital
computational machines, data center infrastructure, and related equipment periodically, subject to business and commercial opportunities. 

The Company has a strategy to prioritize the usage
of carbon-free energy sources, including nuclear energy, to power its digital infrastructure platforms and computational machines. 

The Company manages and operates digital infrastructure
platforms delivering a total current capacity of approximately 129 megawatts (MW) with its current operational sites with an additional
24 MW of future capacity that is under development, all strategically located in locations served by the PJM Energy Market in the United
States. The PJM Energy Market is the largest wholesale power market in North America. 

Previously, the Company also had interests in
the Australian market, however for strategic and commercial reasons, the Company is currently focused on advancing its interests in North
America. The Company currently operates facilities in the United States of America and does not have operating sites in Australia. The
Company has previously reported through an 8-K filing on March 29, 2024 that the Company may seek to exit certain or all of its entities
and holdings in Australia. The accompanying consolidated condensed unaudited interim financial statements, including the results of a
number of the Company s Australian subsidiaries: Cosmos Trading Pty Ltd, Cosmos Infrastructure LLC, Cosmos Manager LLC, MIG No.1
Pty Ltd (on March 19, 2024, MIG No.1 Pty Ltd was placed into a Australian court appointed liquidation and wind-up process), MIG No.1 LLC,
Mawson AU Pty Ltd (on April 23, 2024, Mawson AU Pty Ltd was placed into a Australian court appointed liquidation and wind-up process,
as disclosed in note 3), an Australian entity Mawson Services Pty Ltd (on April 29, 2024, Mawson Services Pty Ltd was placed into a Australian
court appointed liquidation and wind-up process, as disclosed in note 3), Luna Squares LLC, Mawson Bellefonte LLC, Luna Squares Repairs
LLC, Luna Squares Property LLC, Mawson Midland LLC, Mawson Hosting LLC, Mawson Ohio LLC and Mawson Mining LLC (collectively referred to
as the Group ), have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). 

These consolidated, condensed unaudited interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31,
2023, and the notes thereto, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Accordingly,
they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The results of the interim period
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. These consolidated, condensed
unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the
financial position, the results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. 

9 

million, and as of September 30, 2024, had negative working capital of million,
had stockholders deficit of million and had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company s cash position
as of September 30, 2024, was million. 

The Company s revenue is dependent on a
number of external factors, including commercial terms, payments from customers, payments from partners, counterparty risks, and market
conditions, including those related to digital assets, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and other markets. These factors
are outside the Company s direct control, and the Company may not be able to practically mitigate their impact. The Company cannot
predict with any certainty whether these trends will reverse or persist. In addition, the Company s equipment and infrastructure
will require replacement over time as they come to the end of their useful lives to ensure that the Company can continue to operate competitively
and efficiently 

Celsius Colocation Agreement Dispute 

On July 18, 2024, Celsius Network, LLC filed for
arbitration of its claims against the Company with the American Arbitration Association in the matter entitled, Celsius Network
Ltd., Celsius Mining LLC and Ionic Digital Mining LLC v. Mawson Infrastructure Group, Luna Squares LLC and Cosmos Infrastructure LLC -
Case 01-24-0006-4462 (the Celsius Collocation Agreement Dispute ). The Company opposes the claim in arbitration and
on August 12, 2024, filed responsive pleadings denying the claims and asserting affirmative defenses, including set off against the claims,
and the Company asserted cross-claims against Celsius for sums due to the Company in excess of million. This includes counter
claims asserted by the Company against Celsius Network Ltd., Celsius Mining LLC and Ionic Digital Mining LLC in excess of million
for damages due to the Company, including but not limited to, for breach of the Digital Colocation Agreement by Celsius. The matter is
proceeding through the arbitration process. An arbitrator was appointed on September 30, 2024 and the parties submitted their respective
positions on October 25, 2024 regarding the scheduling of the arbitration. A preliminary hearing was held on October 30, 2024 before the
arbitrator to establish an arbitration schedule. Company plans to pursue its claims again Celsius and to defend against claims alleged
by Celsius. 

Loan Disputes with Australian Entities (W Capital
and Marshall) 

The Company is the guarantor of a Secured
Loan Facility Agreement by MIG No. 1 Pty Ltd MIG No.1 with Marshall Investments GCP Pty Ltd ATF for the Marshall
Investments MIG Trust Marshall ). The loan matured in February 2024 and the total outstanding balance is 
million as of September 30, 2024. There have been no principal and interest payments made since May 2023. This Secured Loan Facility
Agreement was entered into with an Australian entity MIG No.1, which was placed into a court-appointed liquidation and wind-up
process and was deconsolidated from the group on March 18, 2024. On May 28, 2024, Marshall submitted a statutory demand for payment
under Australian law. On June 17, 2024, the Company responded, objecting to the demand under Australian law. Subsequently, on
October 3, 2024, a proceeding before the Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales entitled In The Matter Of Mawson
Infrastructure Group Inc. (ARBN 649 261 861) , File No. NSD1395/2024 was filed by W Capital against the Company,
seeking a hearing on November 29, 2024 to determine the Company s solvency under Australian law. Marshall Investments GCP Pty
Ltd gave formal notice that it intends to appear before the court (the Marshall and W Capital Australian Loan
Disputes ). The current proceeding is in Australian courts and there are no associated proceedings in the United States. The
Company believes that W Capital and Marshall are using this proceeding in Australia as a bad faith attempt to gain leverage in
ongoing legal disputes between the parties. 

10 

million (USD million) has been drawn down from this facility. The Secured Loan Facility expired in March 2023. This Secured
Loan Facility Agreement was entered into with an Australian entity Mawson Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd, this company was placed into Australian
voluntary administration on October 30, 2023, and on November 3, 2023, W Capital Advisors appointed receivers and managers in Australia
under the terms of their security relating to their working capital facility. 

The Company, or its subsidiaries, have not fulfilled
specific payment obligations related to the Celsius Promissory Note, the Marshall loan and the W Capital Working Capital Loan mentioned
above. Consequently, the creditors associated with these debt facilities may initiate actions as allowed by relevant grace periods. This
includes the possibility of opting to expedite the repayment of the principal debt, pursuing legal action against the Company or its subsidiaries
for payment default, raising interest rates to the default or overdue rate, or taking appropriate measures concerning collateral (including
appointing a receiver), if applicable. 

The Company has evaluated the above conditions
and concluded that these conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least
one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 

To mitigate these conditions, the Company has
explored various avenues to enhance liquidity, fund the Company s expenditures, and meet debt servicing requirements. These strategies
include, among others: 

Expanding its digital infrastructure platform and increasing
capacities for either digital colocation services and/or AI and HPC markets; 

Executing new customer digital colocation service agreements
in either AI, HPC, and/or digital assets mining to diversify its exposure across customers and/or markets; 

Engaging in discussions with capital providers, including
related to equity and/or debt; 

Considering equity issuances such as capital raises and at-the-market
(ATM) transactions; 

Assessing and evaluating corporate and strategic transactions; 

Assessing and evaluating commercial opportunities or other
business opportunities under consideration; 

Conducting assessments to identify and implement operational
improvements and/or efficiencies and other actions aimed at enhancing revenue and/or optimizing expenses; and 

Evaluating, assessing and pursuing business revenue and margin
expansion opportunities. 

Mawson successfully expanded its Midland Facility
by MW in June 2024, increasing its total operating capacity to about MW from about MW. In August 2024, Mawson expanded into
Perry County, Ohio securing an initial MW of capacity that could expand Mawson s operating capacity to MW once completed. 

11 

MW, or about 5,880 mining units at its Midland facilities. This agreement
helped further diversify our customer base and expand our digital colocation services. 

Although the Company may have access to capital,
equity, debt, and/or other sources of funding, these may require additional time and cost, may impose operational restrictions and other
covenants on the Company, may not be available on attractive terms, and may not be available at all. If the Company raises additional
capital or debt, this could cause additional dilution to the Company s current stockholders. The terms of any future capital raise
or debt issuance and the costs of any financing are uncertain and may be unfavorable to the Company and the Company s current stockholders.
Should the Company be unable to source sufficient funding, the Company may not be able to realize assets at their recognized values and
fulfill its liabilities in the normal course of business at the amounts stated in these consolidated financial statements. 

As previously reported, the Company obtains advice
from outside resources, however, it is important to note that strategic and other initiatives may not lead to any transaction or other
outcome. 

These consolidated, condensed unaudited interim
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
and other commitments in the normal course of business. They do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and carrying
amounts of assets and the amounts of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and meet its obligations
and debts as and when they fall due.

Pty Ltd 

On April 23, 2024, the Company s Australian
entity and a subsidiary, Mawson AU Pty Ltd was placed into an Australian court appointed liquidation. The liquidation of an insolvent
Australian company in Australia allows an independent registered Australian liquidator (the liquidator) to take control of the Australian
entity so its affairs can be wound up in an orderly approach. In the instance of Mawson AU Pty Ltd, it is an Australian court liquidation,
where a liquidator is appointed by the Australian court to wind up a company. As a result of this the Company ceded authority for this
Australian entity to the Australian liquidator, and the Company does not carry on Mawson AU Pty Ltd s activities in the ordinary
course of business. For these reasons, it was concluded that the Company had ceded control of Mawson AU Pty Ltd, and no longer had significant
influence over this Australian entity since the liquidator was in control of this Australian entity. Therefore, Mawson AU Pty Ltd loss
of control was effective when it was placed into Australian court appointed liquidation on April 23, 2024, and was deconsolidated at this
date, in accordance with ASC 810-10-15. In order to deconsolidate this Australian entity, Mawson AU Pty Ltd, the carrying values of the
assets, liabilities and equity components previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income of Mawson AU Pty Ltd were removed
from the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of April 23, 2024, in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation . The net impact

Marshall loan 

The Company is the guarantor of a Secured Loan
Facility Agreement by MIG No. 1 with Marshall. The loan matured in February 2024 and bears interest at a rate of per annum (with an
overdue rate provision of an additional 500bps), payable monthly with interest payments that commenced in December 2021. This loan facility
is secured by direct assets of MIG No.1 Pty Ltd and a general security agreement given by the Company. Principal repayments began during
November 2022. The outstanding balance including interest is million as of September 30, 2024, all of which is classified as a
current liability. There has been no principal and interest payments made since May 2023. This Secured Loan Facility Agreement was entered
into with an Australian entity MIG No.1, this company was placed into a court appointed liquidation and wind-up process and was deconsolidated
from the group on March 19, 2024. On March 19, 2024, Marshall appointed receivers and managers in Australia under the terms of their security
relating to their secured loan facility. The direct assets that secure this loan include 5,372 miners and 8 modular data centers MDCs ),
these assets are held by the MIG No.1 and therefore were included in the deconsolidation. The receiver s statutory duty includes
the obligation to sell the secured assets at market value or, if market value is not known, at the best price reasonably obtainable to
maximize the prospects of there being sufficient proceeds available to satisfy the balance of the outstanding secured debt. It is therefore
expected that this loan balance will be offset in the future by the amount received from the sale of these miners and MDCs. On June 25,
2024, Marshall inspected and inventoried the miners and MDCs located at the Company s Midland facilities. The Company is currently
not utilizing these miners or MDCs for its operations and has asked Marshall to take these assets out of the Company s storage.
Marshall has not responded to the Company s ask for these miners and MDCs to be removed from the Company s storage. The Company
is reserving all its rights and remedies against Marshall.

million, for the purpose of funding the infrastructure required to meet the obligations of the Digital Colocation Agreement, for

of per annum (with an overdue rate provision of an additional 200bps). Luna is required to amortize the loan at a rate of per

to Luna that were held as a deposit. Whether that amount has been forfeited or must be returned to Celsius Mining LLC is the subject of
a dispute between the parties. Pursuant to a court order dated April 22, 2024, the Celsius civil lawsuit against Luna and Mawson has been
dismissed pursuant to the Company s successful motion to compel arbitration. 

On July 18, 2024, Celsius Network, LLC filed for
arbitration of its claims against the Company with the American Arbitration Association in the matter entitled, Celsius Network
Ltd., Celsius Mining LLC and Ionic Digital Mining LLC v. Mawson Infrastructure Group, Luna Squares LLC and Cosmos Infrastructure LLC -
Case 01-24-0006-4462 . For more details on this dispute, please see the Celsius Collocation Agreement Dispute found in Part I. Financial

Convertible notes 

On July 8, 2022, the Company issued secured convertible
promissory notes to investors in exchange for cash. The outstanding balance relates to the interest on the convertible note which has
been accrued from July 2022 onwards and therefore the outstanding balance is million as of September 30, 2024, all of which is classified
as a current liability. On March 28, 2024, the Company was made a defendant in a civil suit before the Supreme Court of NSW in Sydney
Australia, in the matter entitled W Capital Advisors Pty Ltd in its capacity as trustee for the W Capital Advisors Fund v. Mawson
Infrastructure Group, Inc. , Docket No. 2024/00117331, alleging a claim to seek USD million as unpaid interest under a convertible
note after the Company paid in full the principal of million, and AUD million under a loan deed, plus interest and costs for
sums due claiming corporate guarantee by the Company for a Variation Deed to Loan Deed dated September 29, 2022, executed
by its Australian entity, Mawson Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd. The Company sought dismissal of the Australian proceedings arguing jurisdiction
of any claims against the Company should be in the United States as set forth in the agreements between the parties. Despite its objections,
the Australian court ruled in favor of the Australian claimant and rendered a judgment against the Company under Australian law for US
 million as unpaid interest under a convertible note after the Company paid in full the principal of million, and AUD 
million under a loan deed, plus interest and costs for sums due. 

On June 12, 2024, W Capital issued a statutory
demand under Australian Law to the Company seeking USD million as unpaid interest under a convertible note after the Company paid
in full the principal of million, and AUD million under a loan deed. The Company rejected this demand. Subsequently, on October
3, 2024, a proceeding before the Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales was filed by W Capital against the Company, seeking a hearing
in Australia on November 29, 2024 regarding its claims related to Company s solvency under Australian law. The current proceeding
is in Australian courts and there are no associated proceedings in the United States. The Company believes that W Capital and Marshall
are using this proceeding in Australia as a bad faith attempt to gain
leverage in ongoing legal disputes between the parties. For further information, please reference the Marshall and W Capital Australian
Loan Disputes found in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, made part here of and incorporated herein

Revenues 

Digital colocation business
revenues for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 9.52 million and 3.00 million, respectively. This represented
an increase of 6.56 million or 222 increase. 

The increase in revenue was
due to the Company providing digital colocation services to multiple digital colocation customers. For the same period of 2023,
the Company only provided digital colocation services to a single customer whereas the Company now provides digital colocation services
to multiple customers. The Company expects to continue to diversify its digital colocation services customer across customers and to expand
its business. 

Energy management business
revenues for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1.96 million and 1.48 million, respectively. This represented
an increase of 0.49 million or 33 increase. 

This increase is due to the
Company enhanced energy management program participation in the three-months ended September 30, 2024 than in the 2023 period. The revenue
opportunity from energy management is expected to be impacted by seasonal patterns and other weather-related events as well as the dynamic
nature of global power prices. 

30 

Digital assets mining revenues
from the production of bitcoin for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 0.83 million and 6.90 million, respectively.
The decrease for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a number of factors, including the impact of the April 2024 halving
event, and a higher global network difficulty rate in the three-months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, which
led to lower bitcoin production from self-mining. In the three-months ended September 30, 24 period, the Company also significantly expanded
and grew its digital colocation services business across multiple customers reallocating some of its digital asset mining capacities.
The Company believes its digital mining revenue may continue to fluctuate with bitcoin pricing and market conditions as the bitcoin industry
works through the expected volatility inherently associated with bitcoin including the impact post the April 2024 halving event. 

Operating Cost and Expenses 

Our operating costs and expenses
include cost of revenues; selling, general and administrative expenses; stock-based compensation; change in fair value of derivative asset;
and depreciation and amortization. 

Cost of revenue 

Our cost of revenue consists
primarily of direct power costs related to digital asset mining and digital colocation services and cost of equipment and infrastructure
sold. 

Cost of revenue for the three-months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 8.00 million and 7.72 million, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable
to an increase in power costs related to the increase in energy used to operate the colocated equipment for our enterprise digital colocation
customers within our facilities. 

Selling, general and administrative 

Our selling, general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of professional and management fees relating to: audit; legal; professional services, director and employee
compensation, equipment repairs; marketing; freight; insurance; consultant fees; lease amortization, general and other expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.00 million and 3.66 million, respectively. 

Stock based compensation 

Stock based compensation expenses
for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5.32 million and 3.78 million, respectively. In the three-months ended September
30, 2024, stock-based compensation expense was attributable to the costs recognized in relation to long-term incentives for the Company s
directors, management, and employees and to continue to align incentives with long-term stockholder value creation. 

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation consists primarily
of depreciation of digital asset mining hardware, MDC equipment and other data center infrastructure. 

Depreciation and amortization
for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 3.61 million and 11.88 million, respectively. The lower depreciation and
amortization expense is the result of an increased number of the Company s digital asset mining hardware being fully depreciated
and lower number of digital asset miners for the three-months ended September 30, 2024 following the deconsolidation of MIG No. 1 Pty
Ltd. 

Change in fair value of derivative asset 

During the three-months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was a loss on the fair value of the derivative asset by 0.79 million and a loss of 0.52 million,
respectively, in relation to our power supply arrangements. The loss on the derivative asset was due to an expected decrease in the price
of energy costs in 2024 and decrease in the amount of time remaining for the derivative asset. 

31 

Non-operating expenses 

Non-operating expenses consist
primarily of interest expenses and other expenses. 

Interest expenses for the
three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 0.80 million and 0.51 million, respectively driven by default interest on loans
outstanding. 

Non-operating income 

Non-operating income consists
primarily of gain on foreign currency transactions and other income. 

During the three-months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, the realized and unrealized gain on foreign currency transactions was a loss of 0.35 million and a loss
of 0.60 million, respectively. This difference was due mostly to the movement in foreign exchange rates. 

Net loss attributable to Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc. stockholders 

As a result of the foregoing,
the Company recognized a net loss of 12.23 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 19.05 million
for the three-months ended September 30, 2023.

of 14.01 million or 118 increase. 

The increase in revenue was
due to growth of the digital colocation business during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, where the Company provided digital colocation

This increase is due to the
Company s enhanced participation in energy management programs. 

Digital assets revenues from
production of bitcoin for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were 11.60 million and 14.55 million, respectively. In
the nine-months ended September 30, 24 period, the Company also significantly expanded its digital colocation services business reallocating
some of its digital asset mining capacities. The Company believes its digital mining revenue may continue to fluctuate with bitcoin pricing
and market conditions as the bitcoin industry works through the expected volatility inherently associated with bitcoin including the impact
post the April 2024 halving event.

During the nine-months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a deconsolidation loss of 12.44 million. This loss was as a result of three Australian entities
and subsidiaries, MIG No.1 Pty Ltd, Mawson AU Pty Ltd and Mawson Services Pty Ltd going into Australian court appointed liquidation and
accordingly these subsidiaries were deconsolidated. The deconsolidation loss recorded was due to the removal of the net assets and certain
liabilities of this subsidiary from the condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 - Subsidiary Deconsolidation to the Consolidated
Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Item 1. Financial Statements, for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General 

Liquidity is the ability of
a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing
basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts
payable and capital expenditure. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we financed our operations primarily through net
positive cash flow provided by operating activities and other cash reserves. During the nine-months ending September 30, 2024, the Company
repaid 0.50 million of principal payments against previous facilities provided by W Capital Advisors Pty Ltd. 

On May 27, 2022, the Company
entered an At the Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ),
and filed a prospectus supplement, to sell shares of its Common Stock through an at the market offering program as defined
in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Effective May 4, 2023, the Company filed a prospectus supplement
to amend, supplement and supersede certain information contained in the earlier prospectus and prospectus supplement, which reduced the
number of shares of Common Stock the Company may offer and sell under the ATM Agreement to an aggregate offering price of up to 9.00
million from time to time. The Company terminated the ATM Agreement effective September 6, 2024. The Company may choose to enter into
other at the market offering programs with other parties in the future. 

We believe our near-term working
capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of the cash we expect to generate from future operations, our existing
funds, external debt facilities that may be available to us, future issuances of shares, and other potential sources of capital, monetization,
or funds. We believe a combination of these opportunities are expected to be adequate to fund our longer-term operations needed over the
next twelve-months. For our business growth, it is expected we may continue investing in expanding our infrastructure, expanding and/or
upgrading our infrastructure and/or other equipment and will require additional working capital in the short-term and long-term. As of
September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 21.37 million of debt all of which is overdue for repayment unless we refinance, renegotiate
the terms or prevail in our disputes and/or related claims. In addition, the Celsius deposit of 15.33 million is the subject of an ongoing
legal dispute in arbitration. For more details on this dispute, please see the Celsius Collocation Agreement Dispute found in Part I. Financial
Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, contained in this Form 10-Q and made part here of and incorporated herein by reference. 

Please see our Risk Factor
entitled We will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue our operations and execute our business strategy, meet
our debt service obligations and execute our business strategy, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital on a timely basis, on
favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient capital would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and business. in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Working Capital and Cash Flows 

As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of 5.76 million and 4.48 million, respectively, representing a positive
increase of 29 in our cash and cash equivalent balance. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the trade receivables balance
was 12.84 million and 12.11 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 21.37 million of outstanding short-term borrowings,
and as of December 31, 2023, we had 19.35 million of short-term borrowings. The short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2024, relate
to Celsius Mining LLC, W Capital Advisors Pty Ltd, the secured convertible promissory notes issued to investors and Marshall Investments
MIG Pty Ltd (these loans are currently in default, refer to Material Cash Requirements section below for more information . As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had negative working capital of 36.09 million and 33.18 million, respectively.

 Net cash used in financing activities 
 (726,773 
 (5,115,470 

For the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 3.11 million and for the nine-months period ended September 30,
2023, net cash used operating activities was 4.82 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was attributable
to operations and timing differences in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables amongst other factors. 

For the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 1.10 million and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023,
net cash provided by investing activities was 10.51 million. The net cash used in investing activities during the nine-months ended September
30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the proceeds from sale of certain non-utilized equipment. The net cash provided by investing activities
during the nine-month period to September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the proceeds from sale of investment shares in CleanSpark,
Inc. 

For the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 0.73 million and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023,
net cash used in financing activities was 5.12 million. The cash used in financing activities during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the repayment of borrowings. 

Material Cash Requirements 

The following discussion summarizes
our material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations. 

The Company is the guarantor
of a Secured Loan Facility Agreement by MIG No. 1 with Marshall. The loan matured in February 2024 and bears interest at a rate of 12 
per annum (with an overdue rate provision of an additional 500bps), payable monthly with interest payments commencing that commenced in
December 2021. This loan facility is secured by direct assets of MIG No.1 Pty Ltd and a general security agreement given by the Company.
Principal repayments began during November 2022. The outstanding balance including interest is 10.53 million as of September 30, 2024,
all of which is classified as a current liability. There has been no principal and interest payments made since May 2023. This Secured
Loan Facility Agreement was entered into with an Australian entity MIG No.1, this company was placed into a court appointed liquidation
and wind-up process and was deconsolidated from the group on March 19, 2024. On March 19, 2024, Marshall appointed receivers and managers
in Australia under the terms of their security relating to their secured loan facility. The direct assets that secure this loan include
5,372 miners and 8 modular data centers MDCs ), these assets are held by the MIG No.1 and therefore were included in the
deconsolidation. The receiver s statutory duty includes the obligation to sell the secured assets at market value or, if market
value is not known, at the best price reasonably obtainable to maximize the prospects of there being sufficient proceeds available to
satisfy the balance of the outstanding secured debt. It is therefore expected that this loan balance will be offset in the future by the
amount received from the sale of these miners and MDCs. The Company also reserves and retains all rights against Marshall. 

On February 23, 2022, Luna
entered into a Digital Colocation Agreement with Celsius Mining LLC. In connection with this agreement, Celsius Mining LLC loaned Luna
a principal amount of 20.00 million, for the purpose of funding the infrastructure required to meet the obligations of the Digital Colocation
Agreement, for which Luna issued a Secured Promissory Note for repayment of such amount. The Secured Promissory Note accrues interest
daily at a rate of 12 per annum (with an overdue rate provision of an additional 200bps). Luna is required to amortize the loan at a
rate of 15 per quarter, principal repayments began at the end of September 2022. The Secured Promissory Note had a maturity date of August
23, 2023, the outstanding balance including interest is 9.38 million as of September 30, 2024, all of which is classified as a current
liability. Celsius Mining LLC transferred the benefit of the promissory note to Celsius Network Ltd. Celsius Mining LLC and Celsius Network
Ltd filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 13, 2022. Under the Digital Colocation Agreement, Celsius Mining LLC advanced 15.33
million to Luna that were held as a deposit. Whether that amount has been forfeited or must be returned to Celsius Mining LLC is the subject
of a dispute between the parties. On July 18, 2024, Celsius Network, LLC filed for arbitration of its claims against the Company. The
Company has filed cross-claims against Celsius. For more details on this dispute, please see the Celsius Collocation Agreement Dispute
found in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, contained in this Form 10-Q and made part here of and
incorporated herein by reference. 

36 

The Company is the guarantor
of a Secured Loan Facility Agreement for working capital by an Australian entity Mawson Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd with W Capital Advisors
Pty Ltd. As of September 30, 2024, AUD 1.95 million (USD 1.35 million) has been drawn down from this facility, all of which is classified
as a current liability. The Secured Loan Facility accrues interest daily at a rate of 12 per annum (with an overdue rate provision of
an additional 800bps) and is paid monthly. Principal repayments are paid ad hoc in line with the loan facility agreement. The Secured
Loan Facility expired in March 2023. This Secured Loan Facility Agreement was originally with Mawson Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd and
this Australian entity was placed into Australian voluntary administration on October 30, 2023 and on November 3, 2023, W Capital Advisors
appointed receivers and managers in Australia under the terms of their security relating to their working capital facility. The receiverships
of these two Australian companies are proceeding, and the Company is dependent on the appointed receivers and managers to send information
on their respective status. 

On May 31, 2024, W Capital
obtained a judgment from the Australian court awarding it a money judgment for USD 0.17 million as unpaid interest under the convertible
note after the Company paid in full the principal of 0.50 million, and AUD 0.30 million under a loan deed. On June 12, 2024, W Capital
issued a statutory demand under Australian Law to the Company seeking USD 0.17 million as unpaid interest under a convertible note after
the Company paid in full the principal of 0.50 million, and AUD 0.30 million under a loan deed. The Company rejected this demand. Subsequently,
on October 3, 2024, a proceeding before the Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales was filed by W Capital against the Company, seeking
a hearing on November 29, 2024 regarding its claims related to Company s solvency under Australian law. The current proceeding is
in Australian courts and there are no associated proceedings in the United States. The Company believes that W Capital and Marshall are
using this proceeding in Australia as a bad faith attempt to gain leverage
in ongoing legal disputes between the parties. For further information, please reference the Marshall and W Capital Australian Loan
Disputes found in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, made part here of and incorporated herein
by reference. 

Financial condition 

As of September 30, 2024,
and December 31, 2023, we had negative working capital of 36.09 million and 33.18 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and
December 31, 2023, we had negative net assets of 1.56 million and 30.38 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of 224.28 million compared to 182.67 million as of December 31, 2023. Our cash position of September 30, 2024, was 5.76 million
in comparison to 4.48 million as of December 31, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company incurred
a loss after tax of 41.61 million and 48.36 million, respectively. Included in trade and other receivables is a 2.00 million payment
due and pending from CleanSpark, Inc. for the sale of the Georgia facility. CleanSpark, Inc has disputed the obligation to make this payment.
On July 16, 2024, the Company filed a civil lawsuit for its claims against CleanSpark, Inc and CSRE with the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York in the matter entitled, Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc. and Luna Squares, LLC v. CleanSpark,
Inc. and CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC under Civil Action Number 1:24-cv-5379 for claims and payments due to the Company in
excess of 2.00 million. The matter is proceeding through the court system. For more details, please see the CleanSpark Litigation found
in Item 1. Legal Proceedings, Part II Other Information contained in this Form 10-Q. 

Our primary requirements for
liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures, public company costs and general corporate needs. In particular, we have
large power usage costs, and other significant costs include our lease, operational, general costs and employee costs. We expect these
capital and liquidity needs to continue as we further develop and grow our business. Our principal sources of liquidity have been and
are expected to be our cash and cash equivalents, external debt facilities available to us and further issuances of shares. 

37 

We require additional capital
to respond to near-term debt repayment obligations, competitive pressure, market dynamics, new technologies, customer demands, business
opportunities, challenges, potential acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances, and we will likely need to determine to engage in equity,
debt or other financings in the short term. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require
it, our ability to continue to fund, grow or support our business model and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and this may result in bankruptcy or our ceasing
operations. 

The Company continues to take
steps to preserve cash by optimizing operations, costs and pursuing efficiencies. The Company has been improving its revenue generation
by enhancing its operations, driving growth in business lines, and adding multiple, enterprise digital colocation services customers and
diversifying its businesses. The Company will continue to seek to optimize its cashflows through these and other initiatives. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company utilizes a number
of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing its overall business performance, for making operating
decisions and for forecasting and planning future periods. The Company considers the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing
its current financial performance, ongoing operations, and prospects for the future. While the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures
as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, the Company does not consider these measures to
be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial measures. Consistent with this approach, the Company believes
that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial information provides such readers with useful supplemental
data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational
performance. Investors are cautioned that there are inherent limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an
analytical tool. In particular, non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and
many of the adjustments to the GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in the
company s financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, other companies, including other companies in the Company s
industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. 

The Company is providing supplemental
financial measures for (i) non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA that excludes the impact of interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of
derivative asset, impairment of financial assets, unrealized gains/losses, share of net loss of equity method investments, loss on deconsolidation
and certain non-recurring expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in comparing our performance across reporting
periods on a consistent basis where one-time, or non-recurring gains or losses or expenses unrelated to operating activities would otherwise
mask the Company s operating performance.

Critical accounting estimates 

The preparation of the financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There have been no material
changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as set forth in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company,
the Company has elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our Board of Directors, the
Board Committee(s), and management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and President (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial
Officer (principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a- 15(e)) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report. Our Board of Directors and management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the
reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, including the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
described below. Management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level
of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Whilst remediation actions
are ongoing and controls have been implemented across multiple business processes, the material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting and information technology will not be considered remediated, until controls have operated for a sufficient period
of time and have been tested for and concluded to be operating effectively. As operating effectiveness testing has not been concluded
as of the date of this report, we continue to disclose the following material weaknesses. 

Significant Reliance
on Certain Individuals. There is inadequate segregation of duties in place related to our financial reporting and other review
and oversight procedures due to the lack of sufficient accounting and other personnel. This is not inconsistent with similar sized organizations.
This gives rise to the risk of lack of ability to react in a timely manner to operations issues and to fully meet the requirements of
the SEC, GAAP, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, this poses the risk that compliance and other reporting obligations are
not dealt with in an adequate manner. 

39 

Controls over the financial
statement close and reporting process. Controls were not adequately designed or implemented in the financial statement close and
reporting process. This includes controls related to complex and judgmental accounting transactions including business acquisitions and
divestures, derivatives, manual journal entries, account reconciliations and financial statement policies and disclosures. 

Information and Technology
Controls . There are control deficiencies related to information technology IT general controls that in
the aggregate constitute a material weakness. Deficiencies identified include lack of controls over access to programs and data, program
changes, program development and general IT controls. 

Data from third parties.
 The Company does not have the resources and personnel to fully execute its designed controls to ensure that data received from
third parties was validated, complete and accurate. Such data is relied on by the Company in determining amounts pertaining to mining
and digital colocation revenue, net energy benefits, and digital asset assets. 

Fixed asset verification.
 The Company does not have the resources and personnel to fully execute its designed controls around physical asset verification.
Together with system limitations, restricting tracking of fixed asset movements, there is a risk around the existence of fixed assets. 

Notwithstanding the identified
material weaknesses and management s assessment that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2024, management believes that the consolidated condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present,
in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. We rely on the assistance of outside advisors with expertise in these matters in preparing
the financial statements. 

Remediation 

Our Board of Directors and
management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of our financial statements seriously. Our management continues
to work to find ways to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses. With the oversight of the Board of Directors, the Board
Committee(s), and management, the Company plans to continue to progress the remediation of the underlying causes of the identified material
weaknesses, primarily through the performance of a risk assessment process; the development and implementation of formal, documented policies
and procedures, improved processes and control activities (including an assessment of the segregation of duties); as well as the hiring
of additional finance and other personnel for specific roles including financial reporting. 

Whilst controls have been
implemented across all business processes and are operating, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
and information technology will not be considered remediated until controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and have been
tested for and concluded on for effectiveness. As operating effectiveness testing has not been concluded as of the date of this report,
we continue to disclose the material weaknesses. 

Remediation efforts for upcoming
quarters will be focused on progressing the implementation of the remainder of controls, refining existing controls and validating the
effectiveness of implemented controls using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control. We cannot provide any assurance that our remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control
over financial reporting and other business processes will be effective as a result of these efforts. In addition, as we continue to evaluate
and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting related to the identified material weaknesses, management may determine
to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify or update the remediation plan described above. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

Except for the remedial measures
described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, the Board of Directors, Board Committee(s), and
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the Board of Directors, Board Committee(s), and management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

The Company, and some of its
subsidiaries or entities including Australian entities, are currently in disputes, as outlined below. These disputes may be in or may
lead to litigation. 

On January 8, 2024, a commercial
demand was made by an Australian entity Flynt ICS Pty Ltd to the Company s subsidiary and an Australian entity, MIG No. 1 Pty Ltd,
for 0.13 million, for alleged claimed sums due under a service agreement. As determined by the Audit Committee s investigation
into Mr. James Manning, Flynt ICS Pty Ltd is a party related to Mr. James Manning, a former board director and executive of the Company.
The Audit Committee s investigation concluded that Mr. Manning had not disclosed such related party transactions to the Company,
and Mr. Manning has not cooperated with the Company on its investigation. On March 19, 2024, MIG No.1 Pty Ltd was placed into an Australian
court appointed liquidation and wind-up process. The Company has ongoing concerns about Flynt ICS Pty Ltd and James Manning being related
parties and lack of disclosure by Flynt ICS Pty Ltd and James Manning amongst other concerns. Flynt ICS Pty Ltd and Mr. Manning have not
responded to the Company s concerns in a manner satisfactory to the Company. 

On April 19, 2024, a civil
suit entitled Blockware Solutions, LLC v. Mawson Bellefonte LLC and Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc. was filed in the US
District Court, Southern District of New York under Civil Action No. 1:24-cv-02976. The parties have elected to enter the court s
Mediation Program. The matter is ongoing and the mediation hearing date is currently pending finalization. 

On July 16, 2024, the Company
filed a civil lawsuit for its claims against CleanSpark, Inc and CSRE with the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York in the matter entitled, Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc. and Luna Squares, LLC v. CleanSpark, Inc. and CSRE Properties
Sandersville, LLC under Civil Action Number 1:24-cv-5379 for claims and payments due to the Company in excess of 2.00 million
(the CleanSpark Litigation ). The matter is proceeding through the court system. On September 13, 2024, CleanSpark filed
a motion to dismiss. On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a brief in opposition. CleanSpark is due to file a reply motion by November
8, 2024. 

On July 18, 2024, Celsius
Network, LLC filed for arbitration of its claims against the Company with the American Arbitration Association in the matter entitled,
 Celsius Network Ltd., Celsius Mining LLC and Ionic Digital Mining LLC v. Mawson Infrastructure Group, Luna Squares LLC and Cosmos
Infrastructure LLC - Case 01-24-0006-4462 . For more details on this dispute, please see the Celsius Collocation Agreement Dispute
found in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, contained in this Form 10-Q and made part here of and
incorporated herein by reference. 

On October 3, 2024, a
proceeding before the Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales entitled In The Matter Of Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc.
(ARBN 649 261 861) , File No. NSD1395/2024 was filed by W Capital against the Company, seeking a hearing on November
29, 2024 regarding its claims related to the Company s solvency under Australian law. Marshall Investments GCP Pty Ltd gave
formal notice that it intends to appear before the court. The current proceeding is in Australian courts and there are no associated
proceedings in the United States. The Company believes that W Capital and Marshall are using this proceeding in Australia as a bad
faith attempt to gain leverage in ongoing legal disputes between the companies. For further information, please reference the Marshall
and W Capital Australian Loan Disputes found in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, made
part here of and incorporated herein by reference. 

On October 17, the Company
filed a complaint (No. 2024-2332) in The Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County, PA, against Vertua Property, Inc. as landlord for the
Company s Sharon, PA property for breach of the lease agreement and wrongful termination, as well as for tortious interference with
a business relationship, seeking reinstatement of the lease, compensatory damages, disgorgement of revenue, and exemplary and punitive
damages, as well as reimbursement for Plaintiffs costs and expenses including attorneys fees and costs of suit. 

The Company and its subsidiaries
have been in the past, and from time to time in the future may be involved in certain litigation related to our businesses. For example,
the Company and its subsidiaries receive letters of demand for payments or other correspondence from time to time which could lead to
legal proceedings. 

41 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The Company s risk factors
were disclosed in (i) Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on April
1, 2024 and (ii) as disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which was filed on May 15, 2024,
and (iii) as disclosed in our 8-K filing on March 29, 2024. In addition, the Company is subject to risks related to: 

The Company s expansion
into the Artificial Intelligence AI and High-Performance Computing HPC markets. While the Company does
not run AI and HPC workloads for its own purposes, it offers infrastructure for potential customers. As such, the Company may be indirectly
exposed to risks in the AI and HPC space, including: 

Regulatory
 Uncertainty. Many countries have not yet established comprehensive AI regulations, creating
 uncertainty that can impact future development, deployment, and compliance costs. 

Compliance
 with Privacy Laws. AI companies must address compliance with data protection regulations,
 such as the EU s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer
 Privacy Act (CCPA), as these laws significantly impact AI applications that process personal
 data. 

Technology
 and Data Dependencies. There is a risk of dependency on vast datasets for training AI models
 and obtaining quality data could become more difficult due to legal restrictions or competitive
 factors. 

Cybersecurity.
 AI systems, like all other IT systems, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, intellectual
 property theft, and malicious manipulation of AI models. 

Litigation
 and Intellectual Property. Intellectual property disputes over algorithms, AI models, and
 proprietary datasets are common concerns. Legal challenges or patent disputes could negatively
 impact AI companies operations. 

Reputational
 Risks. Pub lic trust in AI
 is in flux and could be undermined by high-profile failures, ethical concerns, or regulatory
 sanctions. This could affect consumer adoption and AI companies images and reputations. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

Celsius Mining LLC loaned
 20.00 million to Luna Squares LLC, through a Secured Promissory Note (the Celsius Promissory Note ), which had a maturity
date of August 23, 2023, and a total outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024, of 9.38 million. Luna Squares LLC has not repaid the
loan as required on the maturity date and is claimed by Celsius to be in default. Celsius Mining LLC transferred to benefit of the Celsius
Promissory Note to Celsius Network Ltd. Celsius Network Ltd has notified Luna Squares the default interest is payable. On November
23, 2023, Celsius filed an adversary proceeding against Mawson, its subsidiaries Luna Squares LLC and Cosmos Infrastructure LLC, asserting
various claims related to the alleged breach of a Digital Colocation Agreement. The Company is pursuing counter claims against Celsius.
For more details on this dispute, please see the Celsius Collocation Agreement Dispute found in Part I. Financial Information, Item
1. Financial Statements, contained in this Form 10-Q and made part here of and incorporated herein by reference. 

The Company has a Secured
Loan Facility Agreement with Marshall Investments GCP Pty Ltd ATF for the Marshall Investments MIG Trust Marshall ). The
loan matured in February 2024 and the total outstanding balance is 10.53 million as of September 30, 2024. MIG No. 1 Pty Ltd, an Australian
entity, has not made a principal and interest payment since May 2023, despite such payments falling due, and is therefore in default.
MIG No. 1 Pty Ltd is also in default of a number of other covenants under the terms of the loan. On March 19, 2024, Mig No.1 Pty Ltd was
placed into an Australian court appointed liquidation and wind-up process and was deconsolidated for the group from this date. 

42 

On March 19, 2024, Marshall
appointed receivers and managers in Australia under the terms of their security relating to their secured loan facility. The direct assets
that secure this loan include 5,372 miners and 8 modular data centers MDCs ), these assets are held by the MIG No.1 and
therefore were included in the deconsolidation. The receiver s statutory duty includes the obligation to sell the secured assets
at market value or, if market value is not known, at the best price reasonably obtainable to maximize the prospects of there being sufficient
proceeds available to satisfy the balance of the outstanding secured debt. It is therefore expected that this loan balance will be offset
in the future by the amount received from the sale of these miners and MDCs. On June 25, Marshall inspected and inventoried the miners
and MDCs located at the Company s Midland facilities. The company is currently not utilizing these miners or MDCs for its operations
and has asked Marshall to take these assets out of the Company s storage. Marshall has not responded to the Company s ask
for these miners and MDCs to be removed from the Company s storage. The Company also reserves and retains all rights against Marshall. 

The Company is the guarantor
of a Secured Loan Facility Agreement for working capital by Mawson Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd with W Capital Advisors Pty Ltd. As of
September 30, 2024, AUD 1.95 million (USD 1.35 million) has been drawn down from this facility. The Secured Loan Facility expired in
March 2023 and the Company did not extend the maturity date, and has not repaid the loan amount, and is therefore in default. This Secured
Loan Facility Agreement was originally with Mawson Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd, an Australian entity which was placed into voluntary
administration under Australian law on October 30, 2023 and on November 3, 2023, W Capital Advisors appointed receivers and managers in
Australia under the terms of their security relating to their working capital facility. 

The Company has a Secured
Convertible Promissory Note with W Capital Advisors Pty Ltd with an outstanding balance of 0.11 million as of September 30, 2024. The
Convertible Note matured in July 2023. W Capital Advisors did not convert the note, and the Company has repaid the principal balance of
the note Convertible Note, however there is outstanding interest claimed which is claimed by W Capital Advisors Pty Ltd to be in default.
On January 3, 2024, W Capital put Mawson on notice of its intent to collect what it asserts are past due amounts for the following claims
as of December 31, 2023: (a) principal and interest payable on the Loan Amount advanced to Mawson under a variation deed, amounting to
 1.30 million (AUD 1.90 million); (b) the principal amount advanced under convertible note, amounting to 0.50 million; and (c) interest
payable on the principal amount advanced under a convertible note, amounting to 0.07 million. W Capital is also claiming issuance of
an alleged 1,500,000 shares of the Company. The Company paid W Capital 0.50 million on March 6, 2024. 

On May 31, 2024, W Capital
obtained a judgment from the Australian court awarding it a money judgment for USD 0.17 million as unpaid interest under the convertible
note after the Company paid in full the principal of 0.50 million, and AUD 0.30 million under a loan deed. On June 12, 2024, W Capital
issued a statutory demand under Australian Law to the Company seeking USD 0.17 million as unpaid interest under a convertible note after
the Company paid in full the principal of 0.50 million, and AUD 0.30 million under a loan deed. The Company rejected this demand. Subsequently,
on October 3, 2024, a proceeding before the Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales was filed by W Capital against the Company, seeking
a hearing on November 29, 2024 regarding its claims related to the Company s solvency under Australian law. The current proceeding
is in Australian courts and there are no associated proceedings in the United States. The Company believes that W Capital and Marshall
are using this proceeding in Australia as a bad faith attempt to gain
leverage in ongoing legal disputes between the parties. For further information, please reference the Marshall and W Capital Australian
Loan Disputes found in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements, made part here of and incorporated
herein by reference. 

The Company, or its subsidiaries,
have not fulfilled specific payment obligations related to the Celsius Promissory Note, Marshall loan, the W Capital Working Capital Loan
and Secured Convertible Promissory Note mentioned above. Consequently, the creditors associated with these debt facilities may initiate
actions as allowed by relevant grace periods. This includes the possibility of opting to expedite the repayment of the principal debt,
pursuing legal action against the Company for payment default, raising interest rates to the default or overdue rate, or taking appropriate
measures concerning collateral (including appointing a receiver), if applicable. The company reserves and retains all its rights under
all applicable laws. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 

During the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) of the Company 
or any (i) Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as defined in Regulation S-K 229.408(a)(1)(i), or (ii) non-Rule
