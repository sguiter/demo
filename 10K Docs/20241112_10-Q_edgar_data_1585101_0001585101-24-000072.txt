Straight-line rent receivable consists of the difference between the tenants rents calculated on a straight-line basis from the date of acquisition or lease commencement over the remaining terms of the related leases and the tenants actual rents due under the lease agreements and is included in tenant and other receivables in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Individual leases are assessed for collectability and upon the determination that the collection of rents is not probable, accrued rent and accounts receivable are reduced as an adjustment to rental revenues. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables, at a portfolio level, are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical collection levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues.

 Commercial Leases 
 
 The Company s commercial leases are generally for terms of years or less and may include multiple options to extend the lease term upon tenant election. The Company s leases typically do not include an option to purchase. Generally, the Company does not expect the value of its real estate assets to be impacted materially at the end of any individual lease term, as the Company is typically able to re-lease the space and real estate assets tend to hold their value over a long period of time. Tenant terminations prior to the lease end date occasionally result in a one-time termination fee based on the remaining unpaid lease payments including variable payments and could be material to the tenant. Many of the Company s leases have increasing minimum rental rates during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions. In addition, the majority of the Company s leases provide for separate billings for variable rent, such as, reimbursements of real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance and may include an amount based on a percentage of the tenants sales. Total billings related to expense reimbursements from tenants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively, which are included in rental revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

 billion in capital through private placement offerings by selling beneficial interests in specific Delaware statutory trusts (each, a DST holding real properties (the DST Program ). Under the DST Program, each private placement could offer interests in one or more real properties placed into one or more Delaware statutory trust(s) by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates DST Properties ). DST Properties may be sourced from properties currently owned by the Operating Partnership or newly acquired properties. The underlying interests of real properties sold to investors pursuant to such private placements are or will be leased-back by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the Master Tenant on a long-term basis of up to pursuant to a master lease agreement. These master lease agreements are fully guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. As compensation for the master lease guarantee, the Operating Partnership will retain a fair market value purchase option giving it the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the beneficial interests in the DST from the investors during a period commencing after the closing of the applicable DST offering, in exchange for OP Units. As the Company retains the fair market value purchase option, which, if exercised, would allow the Company to acquire the real property owned by the DST, the proceeds from each private placement offering under the DST program are accounted for as a financing obligation on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Under the master lease, the Master Tenant is responsible for subleasing the property to occupying tenants and all underlying costs associated with operating the property, and is responsible for paying rent to the DST that owns such property. For financial reporting purposes (and not for income tax purposes) the sale of beneficial interests in the DST properties is being accounted for as a failed sale-leaseback transaction and as a result, the DST Properties are included in the Company s consolidated financial statements, with the master lease rent payments accounted for using the interest method whereby a portion is accounted for as interest expense and a portion is accounted for as a reduction of the outstanding principal balance of the financing obligation. Upon the determination that it is probable that the Company will exercise the fair market value purchase option, the Company will recognize additional interest expense or interest income to the financing obligation to account for the difference between the fair value of the property and the outstanding liabilities. At that time, the Company will remeasure the fair value of these properties at each balance sheet date and adjust the non-cash interest expense recognized over the remaining term of the master lease for any changes in fair value. If the Company elects to repurchase the property prior to the maturity date of the master lease, the Company will record the difference between the repurchase amount and the financial obligation as additional non-cash interest expense in the period of repurchase. For financial reporting purposes, the rental revenues and rental expenses associated with the underlying property of each master lease are included in the respective line items on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The net amount the Company receives from the underlying DST Properties may be more or less than the amount the Company pays to the investors in the specific DST and could fluctuate over time. The master lease agreements are triple-net leases, pursuant to which the Master Tenant will pay the stated rent and will be responsible for paying leasing costs, operating expenses, real estate taxes, special assessments, sales and use taxes, utilities, insurance and repairs for maintenance related to the DST Property.

 billion, was billion. As of December 31, 2023, the Company estimated that the fair value of its notes payable, excluding deferred financing costs, which had a book value of billion, was billion. Management has utilized available market information such as interest rate and spread assumptions of notes payable with similar terms and remaining maturities, to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its notes payable fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit quality adjustments associated with its fair value of notes payable utilize Level 3 inputs. However, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit quality adjustments on the overall valuations of the fair market value of its notes payable and has determined they are not significant. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other liabilities, due to affiliates and distributions payable. The carrying value of these items reasonably approximates their fair value based on their highly-liquid nature and/or short-term maturities.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as amended. Such statements include statements concerning future financial performance and distributions, future debt and financing levels, acquisitions and investment objectives, payments to HGIT Advisors LP (the Advisor ), and its affiliates and other plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto as well as all other statements that are not historical statements. These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as may, should, expect, could, intend, plan, anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, predict, potential or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
 
 The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, the availability of future financing and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Any of the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements could prove to be inaccurate. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, pay distributions to our shareholders and maintain the value of any real estate investments and real estate-related investments in which we may hold an interest in the future, may be significantly hindered. 
 
 The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in certain forward-looking statements: 
 Risks associated with adverse changes in general economic or local market conditions, including the impact of inflation, higher interest rates, and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, which may adversely affect the markets in which we and our tenants operate; Whether we will be successful in raising substantial additional capital, and whether we will have the opportunity to invest offering and distribution reinvestment plan proceeds to acquire properties or other investments rather than using such proceeds to redeem shares or for other purposes, and if proceeds are available for investment, our ability to make such investments in a timely manner and at appropriate amounts that provide acceptable returns; Competition for tenants and real estate investment opportunities, including competition with other programs sponsored by or affiliated with Hines Interests Limited Partnership Hines Our reliance on our Advisor, Hines and affiliates of Hines for our day-to-day operations and the selection of real estate investments, and our Advisor s ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel who can provide service at a level acceptable to us; Our ability to complete acquisitions of properties under contract; Risks associated with conflicts of interests that result from our relationship with our Advisor and Hines, as well as conflicts of interests certain of our officers and directors face relating to the positions they hold with other entities; The potential need to fund tenant improvements, lease-up costs or other capital expenditures, as well as increases in property expenses and costs of compliance with environmental matters or discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous or other undetected adverse conditions at our properties; The availability and timing of distributions we may pay is uncertain and cannot be assured;

 Our distributions have been paid using cash flows from financing activities, including proceeds from our public offerings, as well as cash from the waiver of fees by our Advisor, and some or all of the distributions we pay in the future may be paid from similar sources or sources such as cash advances by our Advisor, cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees, borrowings and/or proceeds from our public offerings. When we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for the acquisition of properties, and your overall return may be reduced; Risks associated with debt, our ability to secure financing and our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements; Catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and terrorist attacks; and our ability to secure adequate insurance at reasonable and appropriate rates; The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay distributions and make additional investments; Changes in governmental, tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations and the related costs of compliance and increases in our administrative operating expenses, including expenses associated with operating as a public company; International investment risks, including the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and the uncertainty of such laws, the tax treatment of transaction structures, political and economic instability, foreign currency fluctuations, and inflation and governmental measures to curb inflation may adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions; The lack of liquidity associated with our assets; and Our ability to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 These risks are more fully discussed in, and all forward-looking statements should be read in light of, all of the risk factors under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Overview 
 
 Hines Global Income Trust, Inc. (the Company or Hines Global is a Maryland corporation formed to invest in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global is sponsored by Hines, a fully integrated global real estate investment and management firm that has acquired, developed, owned, operated and sold real estate for over 65 years. The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2015. 
 
 We raise capital for our investments through public offerings of our common stock. We intend to conduct a continuous public offering with unlimited duration by registering a series of consecutive public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We launched our third public offering of up to 2.5 billion in shares of common stock on June 2, 2021. We have raised 3.4 billion from the sale of 324.8 million shares through our public offerings as of September 30, 2024, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We, through HGIT Properties, LP (the Operating Partnership ), launched our DST program in September 2022, through which we may raise capital through private placement offerings of beneficial interests in specific Delaware statutory trusts holding real properties (the DST Program ). As of September 30, 2024, we held five properties through the DST Program, and have raised net offering proceeds of 402.3 million through the DST Program offerings. 
 
 Summary of 2024 Activities 
 
 Presented below are highlights of our activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Capital Raising and Performance 
 We raised 219.4 million of gross proceeds from the sale of common stock through our public offerings, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. Additionally, we raised net offering proceeds of 209.7 million through the DST program. 
 We declared distributions of 116.3 million. Our gross annualized distribution rate has remained at 0.625 per share since January 2019. 
 We redeemed 198.4 million in shares of our common stock pursuant to our share redemption program. 
 2023 and 2024 have been characterized by muted transaction volumes, challenging macroeconomic conditions and elevated interest rates. Despite this environment, Hines Global maintained its stable annualized distribution rate of 0.625 and had a year-to-date total return of 4.26 for Class I shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total return is calculated as the change in our NAV per share during the respective period, assuming any distributions are reinvested in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan. Management believes total return is a useful measure of the overall investment performance of our shares. Refer to Performance Summary of Share Classes below for a more comprehensive summary of the performance of all our share classes. 
 Investments and Financing Activities 
 We acquired three investments for an aggregate net purchase price of 176.7 million. See Note 3 Investment Property for additional information regarding these acquisitions. 
 Interest rates rose dramatically during 2022 before stabilizing in 2023. Interest rates began to decrease late in the third quarter of 2024, and further rate decreases are currently expected in the coming year. The weighted average interest rate on our total outstanding debt increased from 1.83 as of December 31, 2022 to 3.55 as of December 31, 2023, and was 3.47 as of September 30, 2024 (including the effect of interest rate contracts). Approximately 99 of our total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 has fixed interest rates or has been fixed through the use of interest rate caps. Additionally, we have moderated our use of leverage in recent periods compared to our historical averages to further limit our exposure to higher interest rates. Our portfolio was 33 levered based on the values of our real estate investments as of September 30, 2024, 33 as of December 31, 2023 and 31 as of September 30, 2023.

 NAV and Distributions 
 
 We began determining our NAV per share on a monthly basis in January 2018. As noted in the chart below, the NAV increased between the beginning of 2018 and the end of 2019, but fell to a low of 9.71 as of April 30, 2020 driven primarily by the adverse impact on global commercial activity and volatility in financial markets caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, which affected the performance and value of our investment properties during that time. Further, despite a strong performance during 2021 and the first half of 2022, our NAV per share fell from its peak in June 2022, primarily as a result of higher interest rates and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Set forth below is additional historical information regarding our NAV per share since February 29, 2016 (the date as of which our board of directors first determined an NAV per share). 
 
 1. Please see our Current Reports on Form 8-K for additional information concerning the NAV per share determined as of prior dates. 
 2. Our board of directors determined an NAV per share of 9.03 as of February 29, 2016. Prior thereto, 8.92 was considered to be the net investment value per share of our common stock, which was equal to the offering price per share of 10.00 in effect at that time, as arbitrarily determined by our board of directors, net of the applicable selling commissions, dealer manager fees and issuer costs.

Table of Contents 

 We declare distributions monthly with the authorization of our board of directors. Set forth below is information regarding our historical gross annualized distribution rate, excluding any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees, since October 1, 2014 (the date our board first authorized distributions to be declared). As illustrated in the chart below, our gross annualized distribution rate has remained at 0.625 per share since January 2019. 
 
 1. With the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions as of daily record dates and paid them on a monthly basis through December 31, 2017. Beginning in January 2018, we began declaring, and intend to continue to declare, distributions as of monthly record dates and pay them on a monthly basis. 
 2. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information concerning our distributions.

 Performance Summary 
 
 The tables presented below disclose the total returns for each of our share classes. The total returns shown reflect the percent change in the NAV per share from the beginning of the applicable period, plus the amount of any distribution per share declared during the period. The total returns shown are calculated assuming reinvestment of distributions pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, are derived from unaudited financial information, and are net of all Hines Global expenses, including general and administrative expenses, transaction-related expenses, management fees, the performance participation allocation, and share class specific fees, but exclude the impact of early redemption deductions on the redemption of shares that have been outstanding for less than one year. Total returns may be lower for some periods if calculated assuming that distributions were not reinvested. The returns have been prepared using unaudited data and valuations of the underlying investments in our portfolio, which are estimates of fair value and form the basis for our NAV per share. Valuations based upon unaudited reports from the underlying investments may be subject to later adjustments, may not correspond to realized value and may not accurately reflect the price at which assets could be liquidated. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Actual returns realized by individual stockholders will vary.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Each of our critical accounting policies involve the use of estimates that require management to make assumptions that are subjective in nature. Management relies on its experience, collects historical and current market data, and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. For a discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Also, a disclosure of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no significant changes to our policies during 2024. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our principal demands for funds are to make real estate investments, including investments in real estate-related securities and capital expenditures, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, for the redemption of shares of our common stock pursuant to our share redemption program, and for the payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness we incur. Generally, we expect to meet operating cash needs from our cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to fund our investments and capital expenditures using proceeds from our public offerings, debt proceeds and proceeds from the sales of real estate investments. 
 
 Interest rates rose dramatically during 2022 before stabilizing in 2023. Interest rates began to decrease late in the third quarter of 2024, and further rate decreases are currently expected in the coming year. To reduce our exposure to continued higher interest rates, we use interest rate contracts on our variable-rate debt. Approximately 99 of our total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 has fixed interest rates or has been fixed through the use of interest rate caps. Additionally, we have moderated our use of leverage in recent periods compared to our historical averages to further limit our exposure to higher interest rates. 
 
 The following discussions provide additional details regarding our cash flows. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Our real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay leasing costs, property-level operating expenses, and interest payments. Additionally, we incur corporate level expenses such as general and administrative expenses, asset management fees, and the performance participation allocation. 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 The following factors increased operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 We acquired four additional real estate investments since September 30, 2023. 
 We did not pay a performance participation allocation to our Advisor during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 18.8 million paid out in the first quarter of 2023. 
 We made cash payments for tenant inducements and leasing commissions amounting to 10.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following factors decreased operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 We paid 12.0 million more in interest costs related to our debt financing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest costs was primarily the result of the additional borrowing under our JPMorgan Revolving Credit Facility related to our recent acquisitions. These interest costs exclude payments received on our interest rate cap contracts, which increased by 9.3 million and are recorded in cash flows from investing activities and discussed further below. 
 We paid 13.1 million more in interest related to our financing obligation in connection with our DST Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We held five properties through the DST Program as of September 30, 2024, compared to two properties as of September 30, 2023.

 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to the following: 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Payments of 175.7 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of Diridon West in January, Floralaan in March and Duboce in September. 
 Capital expenditures of approximately 50.6 million at our investment properties. 
 Payments of 81.9 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of 67.8 million from the sale of real estate-related securities. 
 Payments of 17.5 million to enter into new interest rate contracts. 
 We received payments of 32.9 million from counterparties in relation to our positions in interest rate contracts. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Payments of 134.8 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of EMME in June 2023 and I-70 Logistics in August 2023. 
 Capital expenditures of approximately 14.0 million at our investment properties. 
 Payments of 39.0 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of 38.1 million from the sales of these securities. 
 Payments of 19.7 million to enter into new interest rate contracts. 
 We received payments of 19.6 million from counterparties in relation to our positions in interest rate contracts. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Our Offerings 
 
 We raised gross proceeds of 157.1 million and 252.2 million from our public offerings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, excluding proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we redeemed 198.4 million and 205.3 million in shares of our common stock pursuant to our share redemption program, respectively. 
 
 In addition to the investing activities described previously, we use proceeds from our public offerings to make certain payments to our Advisor, our Dealer Manager and Hines and its affiliates during the various phases of our organization and operation which include, without limitation, payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made payments of 7.9 million and 10.7 million, respectively, for selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees related to our public offerings. The change in these fees is generally attributable to the amount of offering proceeds raised, but is also impacted by variations in the amount of each share class sold during the year. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held five properties through the DST Program, and received net offering proceeds of 209.7 million and 121.8 million related to this program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 With the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions monthly from January 2019 through October 2024 at a gross distribution rate of 0.05208 per month 0.625 annualized) for each share class less any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees. Distributions are made on all classes of the Company s common stock at the same time. All distributions were or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of the Company s common stock for those participating in our distribution reinvestment plan and have been or will be paid or issued, respectively, on the first business day following the completion of the month to which they relate. Distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan were or will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which the distributions are made. Some or all of the cash distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, as described below.

Table of Contents 

Distributions paid to stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 116.1 million and 112.9 million, respectively, including those reinvested in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been, and may continue to be, paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the issuance of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, proceeds from the sales of assets and proceeds from our debt financings. We have not placed a cap on the amount of distributions that may be paid from any of these sources. For example, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we funded 11 and 17 of total distributions with cash flows from other sources, respectively, which may include cash flows from investing activities, such as proceeds from the sale of assets or cash flows from financing activities, such as proceeds from our debt financings. 
 
 The following table outlines our total distributions declared to stockholders for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including the breakout between the distributions declared in cash and those reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (in thousands, except percentages).

 Results of Operations 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The table below includes information regarding changes in our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, including explanations for significant changes and any significant or unusual activity. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenues: Rental revenue 83,673 75,601 8,072 11 Other revenue 3,142 2,592 550 21 Total revenues 86,815 78,193 8,622 11 Expenses: Property operating expenses 33,505 31,834 1,671 5 Depreciation and amortization 32,670 31,491 1,179 4 Asset management fees 8,694 7,679 1,015 13 General and administrative expenses 2,414 2,430 (16) (1) Total expenses 77,283 73,434 3,849 5 Other income (expenses): Gain (loss) on derivative instruments (4,658) (1,255) (3,403) 271 Gain (loss) on investments in real estate-related securities 18,711 (8,395) 27,106 (323) Foreign currency gains (losses) (1,396) (2,189) 793 (36) Interest expense (34,699) (24,413) (10,286) 42 Other income and expenses 7,066 3,044 4,022 132 Income (loss) before benefit (provision) for income taxes (5,444) (28,449) 23,005 (81) Benefit (provision) for income taxes 249 (514) 763 (148) Net income (loss) (5,195) (28,963) 23,768 (82) 

Total revenues: The increase in total revenues is primarily the result of our acquisition activity. For example, from July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, we invested over 309.3 million in five additional real estate investments. Please refer to our Same-Store Analysis below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our same-store properties. 
 Property operating expenses: The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to our acquisition activity, as described above. Please refer to our Same-Store Analysis below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our same-store properties. 
 Depreciation and amortization: The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to our acquisition activity, as described above, partially offset by decreased amortization of lease intangibles, as the original term of certain in-place leases across several of our properties ended prior to the current period. 
 Asset management fees: Asset management fees are charged based on the aggregate valuation of our real estate investments, as most recently determined in connection with the determination of our NAV per share. The increase in these fees is primarily due to the additional real estate investments made since September 30, 2023, partially offset by the decline in our NAV per share during the same period. 
 General and administrative expenses: We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue raising capital from our offerings and incur additional stockholder costs as a result. 
 Gain (loss) on derivative instruments: We enter into interest rate contracts in order to limit our exposure to rising interest rates on our variable interest rate borrowings as well as foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates. Such losses were primarily related to the position of our interest rate contracts compared to the

 stabilizing interest rate curves during both periods, and include the effect of 10.8 million and 8.6 million in payments received from counterparties during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Gain (loss) on investments in real estate-related securities: We hold investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These amounts include realized gains (losses) related to securities sold during the year and unrealized gains (losses) based on values determined on a recurring basis. Interest and dividend income associated with such investments are recorded to other income and expenses, as discussed below. The gains recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to recent recovery in the publicly traded REIT market, which had experienced volatility resulting in losses during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Foreign currency gains (losses): Foreign currency gains (losses) primarily reflects the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related entity. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, these losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring debt and cash held in foreign currencies into their related functional currencies. 
 Interest expense: Interest expense increased primarily due to increasing interest rates on our variable-rate loans, as well as additional indebtedness outstanding during the period resulting from additional real estate investments acquired since September 30, 2023. Interest expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 excludes 10.8 million and 8.6 million, respectively, earned in relation to payments from counterparties on effective interest rate contracts, which have been recorded to gain (loss) on derivative instruments. Additionally, interest expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes amortization of deferred financing costs of 1.6 million in connection with our borrowings as well as 7.7 million in interest expense related to our financing obligation in connection with our DST Program, compared to 0.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and 1.9 million in interest expense related to our financing obligation in connection with our DST Program for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income and expenses: Other income and expenses primarily relates to interest and dividend income associated with our investments in real estate-related securities, as well as dividend income received related to our unsold interests in the DST offerings. The increase is primarily due to the increase in dividends for unsold interests received with respect to our DST offerings in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Benefit (provision) for income taxes: The change from a 0.5 million tax provision to a 0.2 million tax benefit is primarily a result of changes in our net deferred tax assets and liabilities related to book-to-tax timing differences at our international subsidiaries.

 Same-Store Analysis 
 
 We evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned and operated for the full periods presented. Same-store properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes 38 properties and excludes Madrid Airport Complex, which was closed in January 2024 to begin a redevelopment project, as described more fully in "Overview Our Real Estate Portfolio" . The operating results of Madrid Airport Complex have been included in redeveloped properties in the below tables. 
 
 The following table presents revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, by reportable segment. In total, revenues increased by 8.6 million, resulting primarily from our recent acquisition activity, as described previously.

 (1) The increase is primarily due to an increase in total revenues at our Dutch industrial properties, primarily driven by the Floralaan acquisition in March 2024 at Fresh Park Venlo as well as other favorable lease activity at the property, as well as rental rate increases at ABC Westland and increased utility and operating expense recoveries at the property. 
 (2) The increase is primarily due to an increase in rental rates at our European student housing properties for the 2024/2025 school year compared to the 2023/2024 school year, as well as an increase in both occupancy and rental rates at one of our domestic residential/living properties compared to the prior year.

 Total revenues: The increase in total revenues is primarily the result of our acquisition activity. For example, from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, we invested over 383.1 million in six additional real estate investments. Please refer to our Same-Store Analysis below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our same-store properties.

 interest rates during both periods, and include the effect of 30.6 million and 21.3 million in payments received from counterparties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Gain (loss) on investments in real estate-related securities: We hold investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These amounts include realized gains (losses) related to securities sold during the year and unrealized gains (losses) based on values determined on a recurring basis.

Interest expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 excludes 30.6 million and 21.3 million, respectively, earned in relation to payments from counterparties on effective interest rate contracts, which have been recorded to gain (loss) on derivative instruments. Additionally, interest expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes amortization of deferred financing costs of 3.7 million in connection with our borrowings as well as 18.3 million in interest expense related to our financing obligation in connection with our DST Program, compared to 3.0 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and 5.3 million in interest expense related to our financing obligation in connection with our DST Program for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income and expenses: Other income and expenses primarily relates to interest and dividend income associated with our investments in real estate-related securities, as well as dividend income received related to our unsold interests in the DST offerings. The increase is primarily due to the increase in dividends for unsold interests received with respect to our DST offerings in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Benefit (provision) for income taxes: The increase in tax provision is primarily a result of changes in our net deferred tax assets and liabilities related to book-to-tax timing differences at our international subsidiaries.

 Same-Store Analysis 
 
 We evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned and operated for the full periods presented. Same-store properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 37 properties and excludes Madrid Airport Complex, which was closed in January 2024 to begin a redevelopment project, as described more fully in "Overview Our Real Estate Portfolio" . The operating results of Madrid Airport Complex have been included in redeveloped properties in the below tables. 
 
 The following table presents revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, by reportable segment. In total, revenues increased by 28.5 million, resulting primarily from our recent acquisition activity, as described previously. See below for additional explanations regarding notable changes in same-store revenues. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages.

 (1) The increase is primarily due to an increase in total revenues at our Dutch industrial properties, primarily driven by the Floralaan acquisition in March 2024 at Fresh Park Venlo as well as other favorable lease activity at the property, as well as rental rate increases, increased utility and operating expense recoveries, and solar subsidies received in the current period at ABC Westland. 
 (2) The increase is primarily due to an increase in rental rates at our European student housing properties for the 2024/2025 school year compared to the 2023/2024 school year, as well as an increase in both occupancy and rental rates at one of our domestic residential/living properties compared to the prior year.

 (1) The increase is primarily a result of non-recurring repairs and maintenance occurrences, demolition costs, increases to salaries of property staff, and increasing energy and utility costs at certain of our central European industrial properties during the first quarter of 2024. 
 (2) The increase is primarily a result of maintenance costs incurred in the first quarter of 2024 during the course of a remediation project at one of our domestic residential/living properties, as well as increased repairs and maintenance expenses at one of our European student housing properties. The increase was also due to legal costs incurred during the current period related to legal proceedings for an attempt to recover costs incurred and lost revenue during our redevelopment of Montrose due to safety issues from the original builders of the property.

 Funds from Operations 
 
 We believe funds from operations FFO is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP operating metric. FFO is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management s view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments and realized and unrealized gains and losses related to investments in real estate-related securities, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that we may not recover any impairment charges. 
 
 FFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of FFO: 
 
 Prior to January 1, 2018, FFO included costs related to our acquisitions, including acquisition fees payable to our Advisor. Although these amounts reduced net income for periods prior to January 1, 2018, we generally funded such costs with proceeds from our public offerings and/or acquisition-related indebtedness and did not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance. We incurred acquisition fees and expenses of 23.3 million from inception through December 31, 2017. In January 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-01 which clarified the definition of a business and added guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. We expect that all of our real estate transactions completed after that date will be accounted for using the asset acquisition guidance and, accordingly, the related acquisition-related expenses incurred will be capitalized and included in the allocated purchase price and will not be expensed. Prior to ASU 2017-01, real estate acquisitions were generally considered business combinations and the acquisition-related expenses and acquisition fees were treated as operating expenses under GAAP. Additionally, effective as of December 6, 2017, we no longer pay acquisition fees to our Advisor. 
 
 We utilize the definition of FFO as set forth by NAREIT. Our FFO may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs, if they use different approaches. 
 
 Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and FFO. Accordingly, the predictive nature of FFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results. 
 
 Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO.

Table of Contents 

 The following section presents our calculation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and provides additional information related to our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the period from inception through September 30, 2024 (in thousands, except per share amounts). As we are in the capital raising and acquisition phase of our operations, FFO may not be useful in comparing operations for the periods presented below. We expect revenues and expenses to increase in future periods as we raise additional offering proceeds and use them to make additional real estate investments. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Period from July 31, 2013 (date of inception) through September 30, 2024

 Notes to the table: 
 
 (1) Represents the depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO. 
 
 (2) Represents the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These securities are incidental to our operations. As such, these gains and losses were excluded from our determination of FFO, as defined by NAREIT, in the current period. Additionally, certain immaterial amounts have now been included in prior periods for comparative purposes. 
 
 (3) Includes income attributable to noncontrolling interests and all adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interests share of the adjustments to convert our net loss to FFO. 
 
 Set forth below is additional information, which may be helpful in assessing our operating results: 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Dealer Manager earned distribution and stockholder servicing fees of 2.0 million and 6.4 million, respectively, which are paid by Hines Global. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our Dealer Manager earned distribution and stockholder servicing fees of 2.6 million and 7.9 million, respectively. Total distribution and stockholder servicing fees earned by the Dealer Manager from inception through September 30, 2024 were 45.9 million. 
 As of December 6, 2017, through its ownership of the special limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership, our Advisor is entitled to an annual performance participation allocation of 12.5 of the Operating Partnership s total return subject to the Company earning a 5 total return annually, after considering the effect of any losses carried forward from the prior year. The performance participation allocation accrues monthly and is payable after the completion of each calendar year. We do not consider the performance participation allocation in evaluating our operating performance. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not incur any performance participation allocation fees. Total performance participation allocation fees incurred were 57.5 million from inception through September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 8 Related Party Transactions for more information on the performance participation allocation.

Table of Contents 

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded noncash adjustments primarily related to amortization of out-of-market lease intangibles, lease incentives and deferred financing costs, straight-line rent adjustments, deferred income taxes and payments related to our financing obligation in connection with our DST Program, which increased net income (loss) by 3.1 million and 6.9 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, these adjustments increased net income (loss) by 2.9 million and 6.3 million, respectively. Total of such adjustments from inception through September 30, 2024 amounted to a net increase to net income (loss) of 48.6 million. 
 We recorded adjustments related to derivative instruments and foreign currencies, which reduced net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 16.9 million and 29.8 million, respectively. These adjustments reduced net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 by approximately 12.0 million and 12.4 million, respectively. The total of such adjustments from inception through September 30, 2024 reduced net income (loss) by 38.7 million. 
 As noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders. We may continue to choose to use proceeds from the issuance of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, proceeds from the sales of assets and proceeds from our debt financings to fund distributions to our stockholders. For example, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we funded 11 and 17 of total distributions with cash flows from other sources, respectively, which may include cash flows from investing activities, such as proceeds from the sale of assets or cash flows from financing activities, such as proceeds from our debt financings. We have not placed a cap on the amount of distributions that may be paid from any of these sources. 
 From inception through September 30, 2024, we declared 609.5 million of distributions to our stockholders, compared to our total aggregate FFO of 346.6 million and our total aggregate net loss of 116.0 million for that period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared 116.3 million of distributions to our stockholders compared to our total aggregate FFO of 47.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared 113.4 million of distributions to our stockholders compared to our total aggregate FFO of 64.2 million.

 Net Asset Value 
 
 Our board of directors has appointed a valuation committee comprised of independent directors, which we refer to herein as the valuation committee, to be responsible for the oversight of the valuation process. The valuation committee has adopted a valuation policy, as approved by our board of directors, and as amended from time to time, that contains a comprehensive set of methodologies to be used in connection with the calculation of our NAV. Our most recent NAV per share for each share class, which is updated as of the last calendar day of each month, is posted on our website at hinesglobalincometrust.com and is also available on our toll-free information line at (888) 220-6121. All parties engaged by us in the calculation of our NAV, including our Advisor, are subject to the oversight of our valuation committee. Generally, all of our real properties are appraised once each calendar year by third party appraisal firms in accordance with our valuation guidelines and such appraisals are reviewed by Altus Group U.S. Inc., or Altus, the independent valuation advisor we have engaged to prepare appraisal reviews and carry out a review of the calculation of the NAV for the Company. Altus reviewed the calculation of the new NAV per share of our common stock as of September 30, 2024, as set forth below. 
 
 The table below sets forth the calculation of our NAV per share of each class of shares of our common stock as of September 30, 2024 (the NAV per share is the same for each class of shares of our common stock): 
 September 30, 2024 Gross Amount (in thousands, except per share amount) Investments in real estate 
 4,322,103 Investments in real estate-related securities 
 176,517 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 137,335 Accounts receivable and other assets 56,063 Mortgage notes, term loans and revolving credit facilities (1,515,137) Accrued performance participation allocation Payables and other liabilities

 262,949 NAV per common share outstanding 10.02 
 The valuations of our real properties as of September 30, 2024 were reviewed by Altus in accordance with our valuation procedures. Certain key assumptions that were used in the discounted cash flow analysis, which were determined by our Advisor and reviewed by Altus, are set forth in the following table based on weighted-averages by property type. However, the table below excludes assumptions related to properties acquired in the past 12 months since the acquisition cost of these properties will serve as their value for a period of up to one year following their acquisition, in accordance with our valuation policy.

 (1) Our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 includes a liability of 52.1 million related to distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable to our Dealer Manager in future periods with respect to shares of its common stock. The NAV per share as of September 30, 2024 does not include any liability for distribution and stockholder servicing fees that may become payable after September 30, 2024, since these fees may not ultimately be paid in certain circumstances, including if Hines Global was liquidated or if there was a listing of our common stock. 
 (2) Our real estate investments are generally presented at historical cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our mortgage notes, term loans and line of credit are presented at their carrying value in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of our real estate investments and debt instruments are not included in our GAAP results. For purposes of determining our NAV, our real estate and real estate-related investments and certain debt are recorded at fair value. 
 (3) We depreciate our investments in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Such depreciation and amortization is not recorded for purposes of determining our NAV. 
 (4) Includes adjustments for certain assets and liabilities, which are recorded in accordance with GAAP, but are not included in the determination of our NAV, such as straight-line rent receivables/payables, deferred tax assets/liabilities and accrued leasing costs.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market-sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we believe that interest rate risk and currency risk are the primary market risks to which we are exposed. As of September 30, 2024, we were exposed to the market risks described below. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to invest in our real estate investment portfolio and operations. We use interest rate hedges in connection with our variable rate debt in order to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We had 1.3 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We have fixed the interest rates on 1.3 billion of our variable-rate debt outstanding through the use of interest rate contracts that are effective as of September 30, 2024. The remaining 9.3 million of our outstanding variable-rate debt is unhedged. If interest rates were to increase by 1 , we would incur an additional 0.1 million in interest expense on our debt. See Note 5 Debt Financing in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning our outstanding debt and our interest rate exposure. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We currently have real estate investments located in countries outside of the U.S. that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each real estate investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We have entered into mortgage loans denominated in foreign currencies for these investments, which provide natural hedges with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduce our exposure to exchange rate differences. Additionally, we are typically a net receiver of these foreign currencies, and, as a result, our foreign operations benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. The table below identifies the effect that a 10 immediate, unfavorable change in the exchange rates would have on the net book value of our international real estate investments, including any foreign currency mortgage loans and their year-to-date net income (loss), by foreign currency (in thousands) (1) : 
 Reduction in Book Value as of September 30, 2024 
 Reduction in Net Income (Loss) for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 EUR 41,197 28 GBP 12,948 (428) 
 
 (1) Our real estate assets in Poland and the Czech Republic were purchased in Euros and we expect that when we dispose of these assets, the sale transactions will also be denominated in Euros. Accordingly, we do not expect to have Polish zloty or Czech koruna exposure upon disposition. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in response to Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 On August 16, 2024, we sold 9,800 Class I shares of our common stock (the "Private Placement Shares") in a private placement pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act, and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder. The Private Placement Shares were sold at a price of 10.00 per share, the most recently determined NAV per share at the time of the sale, for an aggregate price of approximately 98,000. 
 
 Issuer Redemptions of Equity Securities 
 
 Our share redemption program may allow stockholders who have purchased shares from us or received their shares through a non-cash transaction, not in the secondary market, to have their shares redeemed subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Redemptions under our share redemption program will be made on a monthly basis. Subject to the limitations of and restrictions on our share redemption program, and subject to funds being available as described below, shares redeemed under our share redemption program will be redeemed at the transaction price in effect on the date of redemption, which generally will be a price equal to the NAV per share applicable to the class of shares being redeemed and most recently disclosed by us in a public filing with the SEC (subject to the 5 holding discount described below). 
 Under our share redemption program, we may redeem during any calendar month shares whose aggregate value (based on the redemption price per share in effect when the redemption is effected) is 2 of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous month (the 2 Monthly Limitation and during any calendar quarter whose aggregate value (based on the redemption price per share in effect when the redemption is effected) is up to 5 of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the prior calendar quarter (the 5 Quarterly Limitation ). During a given quarter, if in each of the first two months of such quarter the 2 Monthly Limitation is reached and stockholders redemptions are reduced pro rata for such months, then in the third and final month of that quarter, the applicable limit for such month will likely be less than 2 of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous month because the redemptions for that month, combined with the redemptions in the previous two months, cannot exceed the 5 Quarterly Limitation. 
 There is no minimum holding period for shares under our share redemption program and stockholders may request that we redeem their shares at any time. However, shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be redeemed at 95 of the transaction price (the 5 holding discount that would otherwise apply; provided, that, the period that a share was held prior to being converted into a share of another class pursuant to our charter will count toward the total hold period for such share, as converted. Upon request, we may waive the 5 holding discount in the case of death or disability of a stockholder. The 5 holding discount also will be waived with respect to shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan and any shares that we issue as stock dividends. In addition, the discount may not apply to transactions initiated by the trustee or advisor to a donor-advised charitable gift fund, collective trust fund, common trust fund, fund of fund(s) or other institutional accounts, strategy funds or programs if we determine, in our sole discretion, such account, fund or program has an investment strategy or policy that is reasonably likely to control short-term trading. Further, shares of our common stock may be sold to certain employer sponsored plans, bank or trust company accounts and accounts of certain financial institutions or intermediaries for which we may not apply the discount to the underlying stockholders, often because of administrative or systems limitations. The discount also will not apply to shares taken by the Advisor or Sponsor in lieu of fees or expense reimbursements under the advisory agreement among us, the Advisor and the Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership s agreement of limited partnership (the Operating Partnership Agreement ).

Table of Contents 

 Unless our board of directors determines otherwise, we intend to fund redemptions pursuant to our share redemption program from any available cash sources at our disposal, including available cash, cash flow from operations, the sale of real estate-related securities and other assets, borrowings or offering proceeds, without any limitation on the amounts we may pay from such sources. If during any consecutive 24-month period, we do not have at least one month in which we fully satisfy 100 of properly submitted redemption requests or accept all properly submitted tenders in a self-tender offer for our shares, we will not make any new investments (excluding short-term cash management investments under 30 days in duration) and we will use all available investable assets to satisfy redemption requests (subject to the limitations under this program) until all outstanding redemption requests, or Unfulfilled Redemptions, have been satisfied. For purposes of this policy, investable assets include net proceeds from new subscription agreements, unrestricted cash, working capital, proceeds from marketable securities, proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan, and net operating cash flows. Notwithstanding this policy, investable assets may be used at any time to fund any of our operating cash needs (as well as to establish reserves to meet such needs), including, without limitation, the following: property operating expenses, taxes and insurance, debt service and repayment or refinancing of debt, debt financing expenses, funding commitments related to real estate, including without limitation, commitments to acquire new real estate investments (provided such commitments were made at least twelve (12) months prior to the end of such 24-consecutive-month period), obligations imposed by law, courts, or arbitration, necessary capital improvements, lease-related expenditures, customary general and administrative expenses, asset management fees and other fees payable to our Advisor as described in the prospectus, or shareholder distributions. Our Advisor also will defer payment of the performance participation allocation until all Unfulfilled Redemptions are satisfied. Furthermore, our board of directors and management will consider additional ways to improve shareholder liquidity through our share redemption program or otherwise. Exceptions to the limitations of this paragraph may be made to complete like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences, or to take actions necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code. 
 Our board of directors has complete discretion to determine whether all available cash sources at our disposal will be applied to redemptions pursuant to the program, whether such funds are needed for other purposes or whether additional funds from other sources may be used for redemptions pursuant to the program. 
 If redemption requests, in the business judgment of our board of directors, place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on stockholders whose shares are not redeemed, then our board of directors may make exceptions to, modify or suspend the share redemption program if in its reasonable judgment it deems such actions to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. Our board of directors cannot terminate our share redemption program absent a liquidity event which results in our stockholders receiving cash or securities listed on a national securities exchange or where otherwise required by law (including in the event that our shares ever become listed on a national securities exchange or in the event a secondary market for our common shares develops). In addition, our board of directors may determine to suspend the share redemption program due to regulatory changes, changes in law, if our board of directors becomes aware of undisclosed material information that it believes should be publicly disclosed before shares are redeemed, a lack of available funds, a determination that redemption requests are having an adverse effect on our operations or other factors. Upon suspension of our share redemption program, our board of directors shall consider at least quarterly whether the continued suspension of the program is in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders; however, our board of directors is not required to authorize the re-commencement of our share redemption program within any specified period of time. Material modifications, including any reduction to the monthly or quarterly limitations on redemptions, and suspensions of the program will be promptly disclosed to stockholders in a prospectus supplement (or post-effective amendment if required by the Securities Act) or current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Any material modifications will also be disclosed on our website. 
 Any new transaction price may be higher or lower than the most recently disclosed transaction price. The transaction price is not a representation, warranty or guarantee that (i) a stockholder would be able to realize such per share amount if such stockholder attempts to sell his or her shares; (ii) a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to such per share amount upon our liquidation or sale; (iii) shares of our common stock would trade at such per share amount on a national securities exchange; or (iv) a third party would offer such per share amount in an arm s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of our shares of common stock.
