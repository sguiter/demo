, or, for cloud computing service arrangements, over the term of the hosting arrangement. Costs incurred during the preliminary project or the post-implementation/operation stages of the project are expensed as incurred. Software Developed for Sale The costs incurred for the development of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are capitalized in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, when technological feasibility has been established. Technological feasibility generally occurs when all planning, design, coding and testing activities are completed that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced 

8 

. Unamortized capitalized software development costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the product are expensed immediately. Capitalized software costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenues and changes in software technologies at each balance sheet date. In the event of impairment, unamortized capitalized software costs are compared to the net realizable value of the related product and the carrying value of the related assets are written down to the net realizable value to the extent the unamortized capitalized costs exceed such value. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from the related product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of such product, including the costs of providing related maintenance and customer support. 
 to days. Revenue from the sales of certain instruments that involve significant customization, which primarily includes sales of the SomaScan equipment bundle, is recognized over time as the Company's performance creates an asset that the customer simultaneously controls (the instrument installation and customization occurs at the customer site). Revenue is recognized based on the progress made toward achieving the performance obligation utilizing an input method of costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The Company sometimes perform shipping and handling activities after control of the product passes to the customer. The Company has made an accounting policy election to account for these activities as product fulfillment activities rather than as separate performance obligations. Services Revenue The Company generates services revenue from the sale of lab services and field services. Lab services revenue is generated by performing the SomaScan assay on customer samples to generate data on protein biomarkers. Lab services revenue is recognized at a point in time when the analysis data or report is delivered to the customer. SomaScan services are sold at a fixed price per sample without any volume discounts, rebates, or refunds. The delivery of each assay data report is a separate performance obligation. 

9 

. The Company measures progress using a time-elapsed measure of progress as the Company stands ready to provide service on demand throughout the term of the agreement. Invoices are generally issued in advance of service on a monthly, quarterly, annual or multi-year basis. Payments collected in advance of service are reported on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. Collaboration and Other Revenue From time to time the Company enters into collaboration arrangements in which both parties are active participants in the arrangement and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the collaboration, in which case the collaboration is within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements . With such collaborations, the Company determines if any obligations are an output of the Company's ordinary activities in exchange for consideration, and if so, the Company applies ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), to such activities. For other payments received from collaborative partners for other collaboration activities, which primarily include research and development activities, the Company analogizes to ASC 606. Revenue from such activities is recognized as the Company satisfies its obligations. Other revenue consists of license and royalty revenue and grant revenue. The Company recognizes revenue from license agreements when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For contracts that include sales-based royalties, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied. The Company receives grants from various entities to perform research and development activities over contractually defined periods. Grant revenue is not accounted for under ASC 606, as the grant agreement is not with a customer. As there is no authoritative GAAP guidance for grants awarded to for-profit entities, the Company has applied the guidance in ASC 958, Not-for-Profit Entities by analogy. Revenue is generally recognized provided that the conditions under which the grants were provided have been met and any remaining performance obligations are perfunctory. 
 warrants (the Public Warrants to purchase shares of SomaLogic common stock, par value per share ("SomaLogic Common Stock"), at per share. Simultaneously, with the consummation of the CMLS II initial public offering, CMLS II issued warrants through a private placement (the Private Placement Warrants , and together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants to purchase shares of SomaLogic Common Stock at per share. As of January 5, 2024 (the "Closing Date"), the Warrants converted into the right to receive, upon exercise of such Warrant, shares of the Company's common stock for each share of SomaLogic Common Stock previously underlying the Warrants. The Public Warrants are no longer publicly traded and are now identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The Warrants are classified as liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 as these instruments are precluded from being indexed to the Company's own stock given that the terms allow for a settlement adjustment that does not meet the scope for the fixed-for-fixed exception in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Since the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815-40, the Company recorded these warrants as long-term liabilities at fair value as of the Closing Date, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 reportable operating segments: proteomics and genomics. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the business, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), its chief executive officer, assesses performance of operating segments and determines the allocation of resources based primarily on segment operating loss.

Gain on bargain purchase 

() 

The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the consideration transferred, resulting in a bargain purchase gain. Before recognizing a gain on a bargain purchase, management reassessed the methods used in the acquisition accounting and verified that management had identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed, and that there were no additional assets or liabilities to be considered. Management also reassessed the procedures used to measure amounts recognized at the Closing Date to ensure that the measurements reflected all consideration transferred based on available information as of the Closing Date. Management determined that the bargain purchase gain was primarily attributable to a rapid decline in the price of the Company's common stock in the days following the announcement of the Merger, which persisted through the close of the Merger. The bargain purchase gain is separately stated below income from operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The preliminary fair value estimates of the net assets acquired are based upon preliminary calculations and valuations and are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period (up to one year from the Closing Date). The identifiable intangible assets acquired consisted of developed technology, customer relationships, and tradename. The fair values of the developed technology and customer relationships were estimated using variations of the multi-period excess earnings method, which isolates the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured. The fair value of the SomaLogic trade name was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which determines the present value of license fees avoided by owning the trade name. The useful lives of acquired intangibles was estimated based on the contractual terms or period over which approximately to of the cumulative discounted cash flows would be realized, depending on the nature of the asset.

("Illumina"), originally entered into by SomaLogic and Illumina in December 2021 (the "Illumina Agreement"), to jointly develop and commercialize co-branded kits that will combine Illumina's Next Generation Sequencing ("NGS") technology with SomaScan technology (the "Co-Branded Kits"). Pursuant to the Illumina Agreement, SomaLogic received a non-refundable upfront payment of million in January 2022. Subsequent to executing the Illumina Agreement, Illumina paid an additional million to purchase the equipment, supplies and training necessary to run the SomaScan assay at their facilities, representing a modification to the Illumina Agreement.

No royalties were included in the Illumina transaction price as probability of commercialization had not been achieved as of the Closing Date. Subsequent to commercialization of the Co-Branded Kits, Illumina has the right to purchase SOMAmer reagents below SSP through the remaining term of the Illumina Agreement, which will continue for approximately following commercialization. Illumina's option to purchase SOMAmer reagents below SSP for this period represents a significant material right (the "Material Right"). As of the Closing Date, the Company allocated million of the Illumina transaction price to the Material Right, which will be recognized as revenue as Illumina purchases SOMAmer reagents post commercialization. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that commercialization of the Co-Branded Kits is probable due to the launch of an early-access program, and adjusted the transaction price to include million of royalties expected to be received from through . The Company allocated million of the adjusted transaction price to satisfy performance obligations, and recognized that amount as revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. The total transaction price of the Illumina Agreement as adjusted is million.

Convertible Notes In February 2014, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 2014 Senior Convertible Notes (the "2014 Notes"), which will mature on February 1, 2034, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Notes. Holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2014 Notes beginning on February 6, 2029 at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the 2014 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2024, the Company repurchased million of the outstanding principal amount of the 2014 Notes. In November 2019, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Senior Convertible Notes (the "2019 Notes" and together with the 2014 Notes, the "Convertible Notes"). Net proceeds from the 2019 Notes issuance of million, after deductions for commissions and other debt issuance costs, were used to retire all but million of the aggregate principal value of the 2014 Notes then outstanding. The 2019 Notes bear interest at per annum, payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 2019 Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased or converted pursuant to their terms. The 2019 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder at any point prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date. The initial conversion rate of the 2019 Notes is shares of the Company s common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2019 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Those certain specified events include conversion of the 2019 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, entitling the holders, under certain circumstances, to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate determined by reference to a make-whole table set forth in the indenture governing the 2019 Notes. The conversion rate will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2019 Notes are convertible at the Company s option in whole but not in part into shares of the Company s common stock upon certain conditions if the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock has equaled or exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified number of days. Offering-related costs related to the Convertible Notes were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are recorded as an offset to the carrying value of the 2019 Notes. The carrying values of the Convertible Notes approximate fair values as the interest rate and terms are reflective of the rate the Company could obtain on debt with similar terms and conditions. The Convertible Notes are not regularly traded and there is no

million. In connection with the Illumina Agreement, SomaLogic, and now the Company, is required to engage with two contract manufacturing organizations in order to ensure manufacturing capacity. In 2023, SomaLogic contracted with Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. IDT to manufacture custom products. Under the contract manufacturing agreement with IDT, SomaLogic committed to minimum annual purchases of million, which obligation the Company subsumed in connection with the Merger. As the minimum contract term is three years, the total purchase commitment related to the Illumina Agreement is million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet began placing orders under the Illumina Agreement. The Company has entered into several license and patent agreements. Under these agreements, the Company pays annual license maintenance fees, non-refundable license issuance fees, and royalties as a percentage of net sales for the sale or sublicense of products using the licensed technology. Future payments related to these license agreements have not been included in the open commitments above, as the period of time over which the future license payments will be required to be made, and the amount of such payments, are indeterminable. The Company does not expect the license payments to be material in any particular year. Indemnification In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but that have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. However, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers, directors and certain other employees. With certain exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including, among others, attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible loss can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Stockholder Litigation On December 12, 2023 two separate stockholder complaints were filed in the District of Delaware. The complaints asserted claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for allegedly causing the filing with the SEC on November 14, 2023 of a materially deficient registration statement on Form S-4. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin a stockholder vote on the proposed Merger. These complaints were voluntarily dismissed. On December 13, 2023, a complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against SomaLogic and certain officers and directors alleging Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty. This complaint also sought an injunction postponing the proposed business combination between SomaLogic and the Company, which was denied by the Court on January 4, 2024. An amended complaint was filed on June 20, 2024, containing primarily the same allegations, while removing some of the defendants. The remaining defendants filed a motion to dismiss on July 5, 2024, and served an opening brief on August 19, 2024. The Plaintiffs opposition brief is due on November 1, 2024, and the defendants reply brief is due on December 13, 2024. No date for oral argument has been set. Litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the outcome. Whether or not any plaintiffs claim is successful, this type of litigation may result in significant costs and divert management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.

shares of the Company's common stock that were subject to vesting conditions. In May 2024, the Company settled previously outstanding litigation with former stockholders of SomaLogic for million consisting of the repurchase of approximately million shares of the Company's common stock from the stockholders at the market price of per share, and a cash payment of million. The Company recognized a litigation loss of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On June 4, 2024, the Company received a demand pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law from a stockholder to inspect the Company s books and records relating to the prior conversion of the Company s Series B preferred stock. The Company has responded to the demand and has produced documents. Additional lawsuits against us and certain of our officers or directors may be filed in the future. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, we will not necessarily announce such additional filings. In the normal course of business, the Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings or potential legal proceedings, including matters involving employment, intellectual property, or others. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently believes that the final outcome of any currently pending matters would not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company continues to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates. Other Contingencies Following the Merger, the Company is responsible for SomaLogic s liabilities and obligations, including with respect to legal, financial, regulatory, and compliance matters. These liabilities and obligations will result in additional cost and expense by the Company and, if the Company has underestimated the amount of these costs and expenses or if the Company fails to satisfy any such liabilities or obligations, the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger and there may be an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Further, it is possible that there may be unknown, contingent or other liabilities, obligations or other problems that may arise in the future, the existence and/or magnitude of which the Company was previously unaware. Any such liabilities, obligations or other problems could have an adverse effect on the company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. With respect to these additional matters, the Company is not able to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could be incurred.

 million in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and income tax expense of million and million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the Company's tax provision reflects the effect of the Company's foreign operations, which reported lower pre-tax income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Company s effective tax rates for both periods differ from the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate primarily due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets on domestic losses and the tax rate differences between the United States and foreign countries. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets as the Company believes it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

reportable segments: proteomics and genomics. Each segment is identified by its unique portfolio of products. Proteomics includes instruments, consumables, software, and services based upon technologies used in the identification of proteins. Genomics includes instruments, consumables, software, and services based upon technologies used in the identification of genes (DNA, RNA) and their functions. During the first quarter of 2024, the CODM began using operating income to measure the operating performance of the segments. The Company determines each segment s operating income by subtracting direct expenses, including cost of revenues, research and development expense, and sales and marketing expense, from revenues. Amortization, depreciation, and restructuring charges are included in each segment s operating expenses. Corporate costs, including general and administrative expenses for functions shared by both operating segments such as executive management, human resources, and finance, along with interest and taxes, and transaction and integration expenses are excluded from each segment s results, which is consistent with how our CODM evaluates segment performance. The Company does not prepare or report segmented balance sheet information as the CODM does not use the information to assess segment operating performance. The segments adhere to the same accounting policies as the Company as a whole.

Item 2. Managem ent s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited financial information and the notes thereto included appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the audited financial information and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 1, 2024 (the Annual Report ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Standard BioTools the Company, we, us, and our refer to Standard BioTools Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 Standard BioTools Inc. is driven by a bold purpose unleashing tools to accelerate breakthroughs in human health. We have an established portfolio of essential technologies that assist biomedical researchers develop medicines faster and better. We have created high resolution instruments designed to provide reliable and repeatable insights in health and disease, through the use of our proprietary mass cytometry and microfluidics technologies, which are useful in proteomics and genomics, to help transform scientific discoveries into better patient outcomes. 
 Additionally, we have an integrated proteomics platform ("SomaScan Platform") capable of robust, high throughput proteomics analysis with broad proteome coverage, low limits of detection, and high reproducibility. Our SomaScan Platform, together with our industry-leading single-cell proteomics and spatial proteomics solutions, comprise a comprehensive services offering to customers working to identify biomarkers of predictive response, mechanism of action, and patient stratification in their studies. 
 We distribute our instruments through our direct sales force and support organizations located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and through distributors or sales agents in several European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asia-Pacific countries. We also offer lab services where we use our instruments, especially the SomaScan Platform, to analyze customer samples within our own facility. Additionally, we have authorized third-party sites globally to conduct SomaScan assays using our proprietary technology. 
 We work with leading academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, plant and animal research, and clinical laboratories worldwide, focusing on the most pressing needs in translational and clinical research, including oncology, immunology, and immunotherapy. 
 Recent Developments 
 Our leadership team identified three strategic priorities: revenue growth, improving operating discipline and strategic capital allocation, as more fully discussed in Part I Item 1 Business in our Annual Report. 
 Merger 
 On January 5, 2024, we completed the Merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 4, 2023 (the Merger Agreement ), by and among us, SomaLogic and Martis Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into SomaLogic, with SomaLogic surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of SomaLogic Common Stock converted into the right to receive 1.11 shares of our common stock. 
 In addition, as of the Effective Time, we assumed each SomaLogic stock incentive plan, outstanding option to purchase shares of SomaLogic Common Stock and outstanding RSUs, whether vested or unvested. In addition, as of the Effective Time, each SomaLogic warrant was treated in accordance with its terms. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 The following factors have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods: 
 Continued adoption of our services and products: 

29 

o We have a well-established base of marquee customer and key opinion leader KOL relationships in place, and as we grow further, we expect to win contracts with new customers and expand the scope of existing contracts with existing customers. 

o We continue to focus on growth in instrument placements, including the SomaScan authorized sites ("Authorized Sites") program, which we expect to drive future growth in sales of consumables, SomaScan assay kits, and field services. 

o We continue to enhance our proteomics offering through continuous improvements to our proteomics instruments, and the commercial release of the LabThread SLX, which is a fully integrated system optimized for running the SomaScan assay. 

o Total revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of new contracts, fluctuations in customer consumption of and adoption trends, ramp time and productivity of our salesforce, the impact of significant transactions, and seasonality. Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities or improve the productivity of our sales and marketing organization could harm our ability to expand our potential customer and sales pipeline, increase our customer base, and achieve broader market acceptance of our offering. 

Continued investment in growth: 

o We continue to invest significantly in our laboratory process and commercial infrastructure. 

o Investments in research and development will include hiring of employees with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds to enable enhancements to our existing services and products and bring new services and products to market. 

Ability to lower operating costs: 

o As we integrate with SomaLogic, we continue to focus on improving operating discipline through implementation of lean Standard BioTools Business System principles to build more efficient operations and reduce costs. 

o We intend to reduce the cost of manufacturing SOMAmer reagents by, in part, modifying our assays and laboratory processes to use materials and technologies that provide equal or greater quality at lower cost, improving how we manage our materials and negotiating favorable terms for our materials purchases. 

o We intend to reduce the cost of performing the SomaScan assay as we move to either a less expensive array or NGS system for our DNA readout of the protein concentrations present in a sample. 

o We expect general and administrative expenses to trend downward during the second half of 2024 as we reduce headcount and realize synergies from the Merger. 

Seasonality: 

o Our revenue can be seasonal dependent upon the procurement and budgeting cycles of many of our customers, especially government- or grant-funded customers, whose cycles often coincide with government fiscal year ends. 

Expansion of our proteomic content: 

o The SomaScan 11K Platform now includes protein measurements on a broader range of sample types, including cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor, tissue homogenates and cell lysates. The SomaScan Platform provides the largest number of protein measurements and the greatest number of orthogonally confirmed protein reagents in the proteomics industry 11,000 protein measurements simultaneously from sample volumes as low as 55 l giving researchers access to half of the human proteome in just one assay. 

o To maintain our competitive advantage in the proteomics market, we plan to increase the number of protein reagents for commercial availability based on allocated funding, resource availability, and the successful validation of new reagents. 

o We continue to expand our proteomics database and artificial intelligence and machine learning analytics to drive value and market opportunities. 

Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 30 

We generate our revenue from three primary sources: (1) product revenue, (2) lab services revenue, and (3) field services revenues. We also derive revenue from collaborative arrangements, license agreements, grants, and royalties. Customers include top biopharmaceutical companies and leading academic research universities. 
 Product revenue 
 We generate product revenue from the sale of instruments and consumables. Consumables revenue is largely driven by the size of our active installed base of instruments and the level of usage per instrument. Consumables revenue is also driven by the sale of SomaScan assay kits, which is driven by the number of active SomaScan Authorized Sites and the number of assays performed at those sites. 
 Service revenue 
 We generate service revenue from the sale of lab services and field services. Lab services revenue is primarily generated by performing the SomaScan assay on customer samples to generate data on protein biomarkers. We expect lab services revenue to increase over the long-term with new and recurring sales opportunities. With the enhancement of our proteomic services, we expect to capture more market opportunities outside of the United States region, as well as winning contracts with new customers and expanding the scope of sales with existing customers. 
 
 Field services revenue primarily consists of post-warranty service contracts, preventive maintenance plans, installation and training for our instruments. We expect the average selling prices of our products and services to fluctuate over time based on market conditions, product mix and currency fluctuations. 
 Collaboration and other revenue 
 Collaboration and other revenue consists of fees earned for research and development services, except for grant revenue research and development services that are classified in other revenue. We believe expanding collaborative arrangements with KOLs will allow for further enhancements of our integrated platform, lower barriers to adoption and introduce or expand new market channels and customers within geographic regions and markets we do not currently operate in. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue 
 Cost of product revenue consists primarily of raw materials, equipment and production costs, salaries and other personnel costs, overhead and other direct costs related to product revenue. In addition, cost of product revenue includes amortization of developed technology, royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products, warranty costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation expense, and shipping and handling costs. Cost of product revenue is recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are included in cost of product revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our cost of product revenue and related product margin may fluctuate depending on the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities in response to market conditions and the demand for our products. 
 Cost of service revenue 
 Cost of service revenue consists of raw materials and production costs, personnel-related costs, overhead and other direct costs. It also includes costs for production variances for SOMAmer reagents, such as yield losses, material usages, spending and capacity variances. Cost of service revenue is recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized. 
 Our cost of service revenue and related service margin may fluctuate depending on the variability in material and labor costs of servicing. 
 Research and Development ("R D") 
 R D expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs related to enhancing our technologies and supporting development and commercialization of new and existing products and services. R D expenses also consist of laboratory supply costs, clinical study costs, consulting fees, and other allocated overhead expenses. We plan to continue to invest significantly in our R D efforts, including hiring additional employees, with an expected focus on advancing our proteomics products and services. As a result, we expect R D expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. 
 31 

Selling, General, and Administrative ("SG A") 
 SG A expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and general management teams, as well as professional services, including legal and accounting services. 
 Restructuring and Related Charges 
 Restructuring and related charges primarily consist of severance costs related to our recent reduction-in-force and facilities costs for floors we have subleased or have the intent to sublease (net of sublease income) under our facility lease in South San Francisco. These costs, including a reduction-in-force, are incurred to improve operational efficiency, achieve cost savings and align our workforce to the future needs of the business. In addition to the reduction-in-force, we are reducing leased office space, optimizing our manufacturing footprint and streamlining support functions. 
 Transaction and Integration Expenses 
 Transaction and integration expenses consist of costs incurred in connection with acquisition-related activities, including legal, advisory, accounting and other transaction-related costs including integration costs. 
 Bargain Purchase Gain 
 Bargain purchase gain represents the excess of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the fair value of the consideration transferred in connection with the Merger. We determined that the bargain purchase gain was primarily attributable to a rapid decline in our stock price in the days following the announcement of the Merger, which persisted through the close of the Merger.

same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to legal, advisory, accounting costs, and integration expenses incurred in connection with the Merger. The Company expects to incur additional integration costs in the future. 
 Bargain purchase gain 
 Bargain purchase gain increased by 25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the consummation of the Merger in January 2024, which resulted in the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Merger exceeding the fair value of the consideration transferred due to a decline in our stock price following the announcement of the Merger Agreement. 
 Interest Income, net 
 The increase in other income, net of 3.6 million and 12.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023 , was primarily due to the interest earned on increased balances of money market funds and short-term investments and higher interest rates, as well as a decrease in interest expense due to repayment of our term loan in March 2024. Money market funds balances and short-term investments increased as a result of the Merger with SomaLogic. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We recorded income tax expense of 0.1 million in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and income tax expense of 0.3 million and 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our tax provision reflects the effect of our foreign operations, which reported lower pre-tax income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our effective tax rates for both periods differ from the 21 U.S. Federal statutory tax rate primarily due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets on domestic losses and the tax rate differences between the United States and foreign countries. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have experienced operating losses since inception and have an accumulated deficit of 1,151.6 million as of September 30, 2024. To date, we have funded our operating losses primarily through equity offerings, term loans, convertible notes and redeemable preferred stock. Our ability to fund future operations and meet debt covenant requirements will depend upon our level of future revenue and operating cash flow and our ability to access additional funding through either equity offerings, issuances of debt instruments or both. 
 Our liquidity and capital requirements depend upon many factors, including market acceptance of our products and services; effectiveness of our business improvement initiatives and restructuring programs; costs of supporting sales growth, product quality, R D and capital expenditures, including our ERP upgrade; and costs and timing of acquiring other businesses, assets or technologies. 
 We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements considering our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. We expect that our existing liquidity and sources of capital will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our collective balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were 366.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 114.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Resources and Commitments 
 We enter into arrangements that serve as sources of capital and the associated contractual agreements may result in firm or contingent obligations of us. In addition to our common stockholders equity, our sources of capital primarily include debt and operating leases. Our operating lease arrangements require cash repayment and our convertible debt that matures on December 1, 2024 contains rights that may result in their conversion to our common stock prior to maturity. On March 4, 2024, we fully repaid all outstanding indebtedness owed pursuant to the Term Loan Facility and terminated the agreement. 
 35 

We also enter into contractual and legally binding commitments to purchase goods. Most of these contracts are cancellable with little or no notice or penalty. However, once a vendor has incurred costs to fulfill a contract with us, and which costs cannot be otherwise deployed, we are liable for those costs upon cancellation. 
 Following the Merger, we assumed additional cash commitments, including a requirement under the agreement originally entered into by SomaLogic with Illumina Cambridge, Ltd. in December 2021, to engage with two contract manufacturing organizations in order to ensure manufacturing capacity. Specifically, we assumed minimum annual purchase commitments of 2.3 million with Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. ("IDT") who is contracted to manufacture custom products. As the minimum contract term is three years, our total purchase commitment related to the agreement is 6.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have not yet began placing orders under the agreement with IDT. 
 The terms and provisions of our debt and leases are more fully discussed in Notes 6 and 7 , respectively, in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Cash Flow Activity 
 Our cash flow summary was as follows in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30,

Cash flow summary: 

Net cash used in operating activities 

(129,395) 

(29,226) 

Net cash provided by investing activities

Effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 

(518) 

(196) 

Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 

159,439 

(1,874) 

We derive cash flows from operations primarily by collecting amounts due from sales of our products and services, and fees earned under our product development and license agreements. Our cash flows from operating activities are also significantly influenced by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business. We have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we have expanded our business and built our infrastructure, domestically and internationally. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 62.4 million of net proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments to help fund 129.4 million of net cash used in operating activities, 40.5 million of common stock repurchases, and 8.2 million of repayment of term loan and convertible notes. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 36.1 million of net proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments to help fund 29.2 million of net cash used in operating activities and 5.2 million of common stock repurchases. 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our routine business operations resulted in net cash outflows of 69.5 million. Our other uses of cash included payments of 39.4 million for transaction and integration costs, and payments of 10.0 million for restructuring costs. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 100.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by the impact of the Merger, reflecting expanded global operations, as well as significant transaction, integration, and restructuring costs. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 337.4 million compared to 33.4 million used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects 280.0 million of cash and restricted cash acquired in the Merger, and 62.4 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects 36.1 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. 
 36 

Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary uses of cash in financing activities included common stock repurchases of 40.5 million, and payments of 8.2 million to settle our term loan and reduce the amount of our outstanding convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our primary use of cash in financing activities included common stock repurchases of 5.2 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the value of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. We develop these estimates after considering historical transactions, the current economic environment and various other assumptions considered reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments. Accounts that rely heavily on estimated information to determine their values include revenue, trade receivables, inventories, right-of-use assets, goodwill, long-lived intangible assets, lease liabilities, income tax liabilities (assets) and preferred equity. Refer to Item 7 in our Annual Report for additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 There have been no significant changes to our significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report, other than as disclosed in Note 1 to our accompanying financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 From time to time, new accounting standards are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 
 Item 3. Quan titative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Cont rols and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and our interim Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 37 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. L egal Proceedings 
 Information with respect to certain legal proceedings is included in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employee relations, general economic conditions, global geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The repurchases are contingent upon favorable market and business conditions and are funded by cash on hand. The program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased 13,603,617 shares of our common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. 
 The following table provides monthly information with respect to the shares of common stock repurchased by us during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
