 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher 2024 effective income tax rate versus 2023 was driven by the impact of the February 2024 divestiture of the South Texas cement business and certain related ready mixed concrete operations, which reflected the write off of certain nondeductible goodwill and was treated as a discrete tax event.

billion pretax gain on the divestiture of the South Texas cement business and certain of its related ready mixed concrete operations, which was partially offset by a million pretax, noncash asset and portfolio rationalization charge. The noncash asset and portfolio rationalization charge for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the Company's decision to discontinue usage of certain long-haul distribution facilities to transport aggregates products into Colorado as the AFS acquisition completed in January 2024 provides more economical, local aggregates supply. This charge, which is reported in the West Group, reflects the Company's evaluation of the recoverability of certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, for the cessation of these railroad operations.

 It em 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 OVERVIEW 
 Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the Company or Martin Marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 380 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 28 states, Canada and The Bahamas. Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in certain vertically-integrated structured markets where the Company has a leading aggregates position. The Company s heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects. Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. The aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the Building Materials business. 
 The Company s Building Materials business includes two reportable segments: the East Group and the West Group.

The Building Materials business is significantly affected by weather patterns, seasonal changes and other climate-related conditions. Production and shipment levels for aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt materials correlate with general construction activity levels, most of which occur in the spring, summer and fall. Thus, production and shipment levels vary by quarter. Excessive rainfall, drought, wildfire and extreme hot and cold temperatures can also jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the Company. Due to the potentially significant impact of weather on the Company s operations, current-period results are not necessarily indicative of expected performance for other interim periods or the full year. 
 The Company has a Magnesia Specialties business with manufacturing facilities in Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville, Ohio. The Magnesia Specialties business produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers in the steel industry.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The Company outlined its critical accounting policies in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no changes to the Company s critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Earnings from continuing operations before interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates; acquisition, divestiture and integration expenses; the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting (the Inventory Markup); nonrecurring gain on divestiture; and noncash asset and portfolio rationalization charge, or Adjusted EBITDA, is an indicator used by the Company and investors to evaluate the Company s operating performance from period to period. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company has elected to add back, for purposes of its Adjusted EBITDA calculation, acquisition, divestiture and integration expenses and the Inventory Markup only for transactions with consideration of 2.0 billion or more and expected acquisition, divestiture and integration expenses of at least 15 million. For 2024, this includes the acquisition of 20 active aggregates operations from affiliates of Blue Water Industries LLC (BWI Southeast) and the divestiture of the South Texas cement plant and related ready mixed concrete operations (the Divestiture). 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and, as such, should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta, earnings from operations or operating cash flow. Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and may vary among companies, Adjusted EBITDA as presented by the Company may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta to Adjusted EBITDA:

 Mix-adjusted average selling price (mix-adjusted ASP) is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impacts of period-over-period product, geographic and other mix on average selling price. Mix-adjusted ASP is calculated by comparing current-period shipments to like-for-like shipments in the comparable prior period. Management uses this metric to evaluate the realization of pricing increases and believes this information is useful to investors as it provides same-on-same pricing trends. 
 The following reconciles reported average selling price per ton to organic mix-adjusted ASP and corresponding variances:

Third-quarter aggregates shipments decreased 3.9 from the prior-year quarter, as shipments from acquired operations were offset by historically wet weather in the Company's East and Southwest divisions, and softer warehouse and residential demand across the Company's footprint. Aggregates average selling price per ton of 21.52 increased 7.7 , or 8.9 on an organic mix-adjusted basis, over the prior-year quarter. Aggregates gross profit decreased modestly to 438 million, driven primarily by lower operating leverage from reduced shipments and weather-driven inefficiencies, which were largely offset by acquisition contributions. 
 Cement and ready mixed concrete revenues decreased 30 to 296 million and gross profit decreased 37 to 89 million, compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to the Divestiture. 
 Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 5 from the prior-year quarter to 343 million as shipments were negatively impacted by project delays and softer nonresidential market demand. Gross profit decreased 8 from prior year to 61 million due to lower revenues combined with higher aggregates costs. 
 Aggregates End-Use Markets 
 Aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market decreased 4 quarter-over-quarter, as contributions from acquired operations were more than offset by weather-driven project delays. The infrastructure market accounted for 39 of third-quarter aggregates shipments. 
 Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market decreased 4 , driven by inclement weather in many of the Company's markets and declining warehouse construction, partially offset by shipments at acquired operations. The nonresidential market represented 33 of third-quarter aggregates shipments. 
 Aggregates shipments to the residential market decreased 2 , resulting from inclement weather and general softening in single-family housing resulting from affordability concerns. The residential market accounted for 23 of third-quarter aggregates shipments. 
 The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 5 of third-quarter aggregates shipments. Volumes to this end use market decreased 15 quarter-over-quarter due to inclement weather and project delays. 
 Magnesia Specialties Business 
 Magnesia Specialties third-quarter revenues of 82 million increased 8 from the prior-year quarter and gross profit increased 34 to 29 million, as pricing growth and improved lime shipments, coupled with lower energy costs, more than offset lower chemical shipments.

Year-to-date aggregates shipments decreased 5.8 , due largely to significant precipitation in Texas and the Company's East and Central Divisions, as well as softening demand in warehouse, office and retail construction, which were partially offset by shipments from acquired operations. Aggregates average selling price per ton of 21.74 increased 10.2 , or 11.4 on an organic mix-adjusted basis, due to strong realization of the cumulative effects of 2023 and 2024 pricing actions. Aggregates gross profit improved 2 to 1.1 billion, as pricing growth more than offset lower shipments. 
 Cement and ready mixed concrete revenues decreased 30 to 822 million and gross profit decreased 42 to 192 million, compared with the prior-year period, primarily attributable to the Divestiture, as well as significant precipitation in Texas. 
 Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 2 to 647 million and gross profit decreased 7 to 77 million, compared with the prior-year period, as lower asphalt shipments and higher aggregates costs more than offset pricing growth. 
 Aggregates End-Use Markets 
 While aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market decreased 4 , due largely to inclement weather, the Company expects public construction activity to grow, supported by federal and state funding increases. The infrastructure market accounted for 37 of year-to-date aggregates shipments.

 Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market decreased 7 , driven by inclement weather in many of the Company's markets and declining warehouse, office and retail construction. The nonresidential market represented 35 of year-to-date aggregates shipments. 
 Aggregates shipments to the residential market decreased 6 , resulting from inclement weather and general softening in single-family housing resulting from affordability concerns. The residential market accounted for 23 of year-to-date aggregates shipments. 
 The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 5 of year-to-date aggregates shipments. Volumes to this end use market decreased 8 from the prior-year period. 
 Magnesia Specialties Business 
 Magnesia Specialties revenues increased 2 to 243 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and gross profit increased 14 to 84 million, as higher pricing combined with lower energy and raw materials costs more than offset lower chemical shipments. 
 Consolidated Operating Results 	 
 Consolidated SG A for the nine months ended September 30 of 2024 was 7.0 of revenues compared with 6.3 in the prior-year period, reflecting lower revenues. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, consolidated other operating income, net, was 1.3 billion in 2024 and 16 million in 2023. The 2024 amount included a 1.3 billion pretax gain on the Divestiture, which was partially offset by a 50 million pretax, noncash asset and portfolio rationalization charge (the Rationalization Charge; see Note 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 Earnings from operations for the nine months ended September 30 were 2.3 billion in 2024 compared with 1.2 billion in 2023. The 2024 amount included a 1.3 billion pretax gain on the Divestiture. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective income tax rates for continuing operations were 24.1 and 20.6 , respectively. The higher 2024 effective income tax rate versus 2023 was driven by the Divestiture, which reflected the write-off of certain nondeductible goodwill and was treated as a discrete tax event. 
 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta were 1.7 billion, or 27.60 per diluted share, in 2024 compared with 912 million, or 14.69 per diluted share, in 2023. 2024 included an after-tax gain of 976 million, or 15.83 per diluted share, on the Divestiture, an after-tax loss of 37 million, or 0.61 per diluted share, for the Rationalization Charge, an after-tax charge of 15 million, or 0.23 per diluted share, for the Inventory Markup and after-tax acquisition, divestiture and integration expenses of 31 million, or 0.50 per diluted share, related to the Blue Water Industries LLC acquisition and the Divestiture. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 773 million and 973 million, respectively, with the year-over-year decrease driven largely by significantly higher income tax payments in 2024 resulting from the Divestiture. Operating cash flow is substantially derived from consolidated net earnings before deducting depreciation, depletion and amortization, and changes in working capital requirements. 
 The Internal Revenue Service recently announced disaster tax relief for North Carolina businesses affected by Hurricanes Debby and Helene. This relief allows the Company to defer estimated federal and certain state income, payroll and excise

 tax payments for the period from August 2024 through April 2025. The deferred obligation will be due May 1, 2025. The Company deferred income tax payments of 123 million under this provision as of September 30, 2024, which benefited operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The seasonal nature of construction activity impacts the Company s interim operating cash flow when compared with the full year. Full-year 2023 net cash provided by operating activities was 1.5 billion. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid 622 million and 464 million, respectively, for additions to property, plant and equipment. Included in the 2024 additions is the purchase of land and aggregates reserves. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company received pretax cash proceeds of 2.1 billion from the Divestiture. On April 5, 2024, the Company used 2.05 billion of cash on hand to fund the acquisition of 20 active aggregates operations in Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia from affiliates of Blue Water Industries LLC. Subsequently, the Company used available liquidity to fund the South Florida aggregates acquisition on October 25, 2024. 
 On July 2, 2024, the Company used available liquidity to repay the 400 million of 4.250 Senior Notes that matured by their own terms. 
 The Company can repurchase its common stock through open-market purchases pursuant to authority granted by its Board of Directors or through private transactions at such prices and upon such terms as the Chief Executive Officer deems appropriate. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company repurchased 785,758 shares of common stock at an average price of 572.70 and an aggregate cost of 450 million. At September 30, 2024, 11.9 million shares of common stock remain under the Company s repurchase authorization. 
 The Company, through a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, has a 400 million trade receivable securitization facility (the Trade Receivable Facility) that matures on September 17, 2025. The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Company s other debt agreements. 
 The Company has an 800 million five-year senior unsecured revolving facility (the Revolving Facility), which matures in December 2028. The Revolving Facility requires the Company s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing-twelve-month period (the Ratio) to not exceed 3.50 times as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Company may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions during the quarter or the three preceding quarters so long as the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed 4.00 times. Additionally, if there are no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility or the Trade Receivable Facility, consolidated debt, including debt for which the Company is a guarantor, shall be reduced in an amount equal to the lesser of 500 million or the sum of the Company s unrestricted cash and temporary investments, for purposes of the covenant calculation. The Company was in compliance with the Ratio at September 30, 2024. 
 In the event of a default on the Ratio, the lenders can terminate the Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility and declare any outstanding balances as immediately due. 
 Cash on hand, along with the Company s projected internal cash flows and availability of financing resources, including its access to debt and equity capital markets, is expected to continue to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support anticipated operating needs, cover debt service requirements, address near-term debt maturities, meet capital expenditures and discretionary investment needs, fund certain acquisition opportunities that may arise, allow for payment of dividends for the foreseeable future and allow the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock. At September 30, 2024, there was 95 million outstanding under the Trade Receivable Facility and no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility, and the Company had 1.10 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility, subject to complying with the related leverage covenant. As of October

MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES FORM 10-Q For the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

 It em 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The Company s operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Consequently, these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs. 
 Management has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Company's business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal, state and local budget and deficit issues. Further, delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain affordable financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty. 
 Demand in the nonresidential and residential construction markets, which combined accounted for 58 of aggregates shipments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is affected by interest rates. While the Federal Reserve has lowered the target federal funds rate 50 basis points since December 31, 2023, it remains above historical levels. 
 Aside from these inherent risks from within its operations, the Company s earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates and changes in enacted tax laws. 
 Variable-Rate Borrowing Facilities. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an 800 million Revolving Facility and a 400 million Trade Receivable Facility. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates on variable-rate borrowings of 95 million, which was the collective outstanding balance at September 30, 2024, would increase interest expense by 1 million on an annual basis. 
 Pension Expense. The Company s results of operations are affected by its pension expense. Assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and, for the qualified defined benefit pension plan only, the expected long-term rate of return on assets. Therefore, the Company has interest rate risk associated with these factors. The impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the Company s annual pension expense is discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Income Tax. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially impact the Company s effective tax rate, tax payments, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Energy Costs . Energy costs, including diesel fuel, natural gas, electricity, coal and petroleum coke, represent significant production costs of the Company. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the Company s products. The cement product line and Magnesia Specialties business each have varying fixed-price agreements for a portion of their 2024 energy requirements. Organic energy expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15 compared with the prior-year period, reflecting a 0.33-per-gallon decrease in organic diesel costs and a 36 decrease in organic natural gas costs. A hypothetical 10 change in the Company s organic energy prices in 2024 as compared with 2023, assuming comparable volumes, would change 2024 energy expense by 36 million. 
 It em 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 EXHIBIT 95 
 
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 
 The operation of the Company s domestic aggregates quarries and mines is subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). MSHA inspects the Company s quarries and mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to the alleged violation. Citations or orders may be contested and appealed and, as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount; they are sometimes dismissed. 
 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), the Company is required to present information regarding certain mining safety and health citations which MSHA has issued with respect to its aggregates mining operations in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the quarry or mine and types of operations (i.e., underground or surface), (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and location to location, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. 
 
 The Company has provided the information below in response to the SEC s rules and regulations issued under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The disclosures reflect U.S. mining operations only, as the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the SEC rules and regulations thereunder do not apply to the Company s quarries and mines operated outside the United States. 
 
 The Company presents the following items regarding certain mining safety and health matters for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 
 
 Total number of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which the Company has received a citation from MSHA (hereinafter, Section 104 S S Citations ). If MSHA determines that a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard is likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness under the unique circumstance contributed to by the violation, MSHA will classify the violation as a significant and substantial violation (commonly referred to as an S S violation). MSHA inspectors will classify each citation or order written as an S S violation or not. 

Total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 104(b) Orders ). These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines a previous violation covered by a Section 104(a) citation has not been totally abated within the prescribed time period, so a further order is needed to require the mine operator to immediately withdraw all persons (except authorized persons) from the affected area of a quarry or mine. 

Total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 104(d) Citations and Orders ). These violations are similar to those described above, but the standard is that the violation could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a safety 

Appendix 1 

 or health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent danger, and the MSHA inspector finds that the violation is caused by an unwarranted failure of the operator to comply with the health and safety standards. 

Total number of flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 110(b)(2) Violations ). These violations are penalty violations issued if MSHA determines that violations are flagrant , for which civil penalties may be assessed. A flagrant violation means a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. 

Total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act (hereinafter, Section 107(a) Orders ). These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines an imminent danger exists in the quarry or mine and results in orders of immediate withdrawal of all persons (except certain authorized persons) from the area of the quarry or mine affected by its condition until the imminent danger and the underlying conditions causing the imminent danger no longer exist. 

Total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act. These are the amounts of proposed assessments issued by MSHA with each citation or order for the time period covered by the reports. Penalties are assessed by MSHA according to a formula that considers a number of factors, including the mine operator s history, size, negligence, gravity of the violation, good faith in trying to correct the violation promptly, and the effect of the penalty on the operator s ability to continue in business. 

Total number of mining-related fatalities. Mines subject to the Mine Act are required to report all fatalities occurring at their facilities unless the fatality is determined to be non-chargeable to the mining industry. The final rules of the SEC require disclosure of mining-related fatalities at mines subject to the Mine Act. Only fatalities determined by MSHA not to be mining-related may be excluded. 

Receipt of written notice from MSHA of a pattern (or a potential to have such a pattern) of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of other mine health or safety hazards under Section 104(e) of the Mine Act. If MSHA determines that a mine has a pattern of these types of violations, or the potential to have such a pattern, MSHA is required to notify the mine operator of the existence of such a thing. 

Legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissions pending as of the last day of period. 

Legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissions initiated during period. 

Legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissions resolved during period. 

The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. The cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and 

Appendix 1 

 penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under Section 105 of the Mine Act. Appendix 1 shows, for each of the Company s quarries and mines identified, as of September 30, 2024, the number of legal actions pending before the Commission, along with the number of legal actions initiated before the Commission during the quarter as well as resolved during the quarter. In addition, Appendix 1 includes a footnote to the column for legal actions before the Commission pending as of the last day of the period, which footnote breaks down that total number of legal actions pending by categories according to the type of proceeding in accordance with various categories established by the Procedural Rules of the Commission.
