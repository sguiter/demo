 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported estimated income and mining tax expense of approximately million, resulting in an effective tax rate of . This compares to income tax expense of million for an effective tax rate of ) during the third quarter of 2023. The comparability of the Company s income and mining tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate for the reported periods was impacted by multiple factors, primarily: (i) variations in the Company s income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) mining taxes; (iv) percentage depletion; (v) foreign exchange rates; and (vi) the impact of uncertain tax positions. Therefore, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, period to period. 
 A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined that the Company ultimately will be more likely than not able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of factors that impact the Company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. For additional information, please see the section titled Item 1A - Risk Factors . 
 The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The statute of limitations remains open from 2021 forward for the U.S. federal jurisdiction and from 2017 forward for certain other foreign jurisdictions. Regarding the statutes of limitation that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions and possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to which none of the issues are individually significant, the Company believes that there will be no further decrease in any unrecognized income tax benefits. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties were not significant. The Company s continuing practice is to recognize potential interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income tax expense.

 The fair value of the 2029 Senior Notes was estimated using quoted market prices. The fair value of the RCF approximates book value as the liability is secured, has a variable interest rate, and lacks significant credit concerns. 
 In July 2024, the Company completed the purchase of the Fresnillo mining concessions. Total consideration includes a cash payment of million due at closing, the Deferred Cash Due 2025 of million, and the Deferred Cash Due 2026 of million. The fair value of the Deferred Cash Due 2025 and Deferred Cash Due 2026 was estimated using the pricing model with inputs derived from observable and unobservable data, including yield curves and credit spreads. The model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE 16 
 million in principal is due from the Mexican government associated with amounts that were paid as VAT under Coeur Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. s Coeur Mexicana s prior royalty agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation, which was terminated in 2016. Coeur Mexicana applied for and initially received refunds in the normal course of these amounts paid as VAT associated with the royalty payments; however, in 2011 the Mexican tax authorities began denying refunds of these amounts based on the argument that VAT was not legally due on the royalty payments. Accordingly, Coeur Mexicana began to request refunds of these amounts paid as VAT as undue payments, which the Mexican tax authorities also denied. The Company has since been engaged in ongoing efforts to recover these amounts from the Mexican government (including through refiling refund requests as undue payments rather than refunds of VAT that were due, litigation and international arbitration). Despite a favorable ruling from Mexican tax courts in this matter in 2018, litigation of the matter continued at the Mexican administrative, appeals court and supreme court levels for several years, most of which was determined unfavorably to Coeur based on interpretations of applicable law and prior court decisions which the Company and its counsel believe are contrary to legal precedent, conflicting and erroneous. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the receivable and intends to rigorously continue its recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the receivable and unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the receivable at September 30, 2021. Coeur has elected to initiate an arbitration proceeding under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, to pursue recovery of the unduly paid VAT plus interest and other damages. Outcomes in NAFTA arbitration and the process for recovering funds even if there is a successful outcome in NAFTA arbitration can be lengthy and unpredictable. 
 In addition, ongoing litigation with the Mexican government associated with enforcement of water rights in Mexico, if unsuccessful, may impact Coeur Mexicana s ability to access new sources of water to provide sufficient supply for its operations at Palmarejo and, if material, may have a material adverse impact on the Company s operations and financial results. 
 Palmarejo Gold Stream 
 Coeur Mexicana currently sells of Palmarejo gold production (excluding production from certain properties acquired in 2015 and 2024) to a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation Franco-Nevada under a gold stream agreement for the lesser of or spot price per ounce Franco-Nevada Gold Stream Agreement ). The Franco-Nevada Gold Stream Agreement supersedes an earlier arrangement made in January 2009 in which Franco-Nevada purchased a royalty covering of the life of mine gold to be produced by Coeur Mexicana from its Palmarejo silver and gold mine in Mexico in exchange for total consideration of million, consisting of million in cash plus a warrant to acquire Franco-Nevada Common Shares that was then-valued at million (the Prior Gold Stream Agreement ). The Prior Gold Stream Agreement was terminated in 2014 and its minimum ounce delivery requirement satisfied in 2016, after which sales under the Franco-Nevada Gold Stream Agreement commenced. Under the Franco-Nevada Gold Stream Agreement, Coeur Mexicana received a million deposit toward future deliveries under the gold stream agreement. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, although Coeur Mexicana has satisfied its contractual obligation to repay the deposit to Franco-Nevada, the deposit is accounted for as deferred revenue and is recognized as revenue on a units-of-production basis as ounces are sold to Franco-Nevada. Because there is no minimum obligation associated with the deposit, it is not considered a financing, and each shipment is considered to be a separate performance obligation. The stream agreement represents a contract liability under ASC 606, which requires the Company to ratably recognize a portion of the deposit as revenue for each gold ounce delivered to Franco-Nevada. The remaining unamortized balance is included in Accrued liabilities and other and Other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Metal Sales Prepayments 
 In June 2019, Coeur amended its existing sales and purchase contract with a metal sales counterparty for gold concentrate from its Kensington mine (the Amended Sales Contract ). From time to time thereafter, the Amended Sales Contract has been further amended to allow for additional prepayments. In September 2024, the Company received an additional prepayment of million, following the fulfillment of the previous received prepayments. 
 Additionally, in June 2023, the Company entered into sales and purchase contracts with a metal sales counterparty for gold electrolytic cathodic sludge from its Wharf mine and gold and silver dor from its Rochester mine, both of which were amended in September 2023 to increase the maximum amount available in prepayments to million and million, respectively. In September 2024, Wharf and Rochester received additional prepayments of million and million, respectively, following the fulfillment of the previous received prepayments received at Wharf and Rochester. 
 The metal sales prepayments represent a contract liability under ASC 606, which requires the Company to recognize ratably a portion of the deposit as revenue for each gold and silver ounce delivered to the customer. The remaining contract liability is included in Accrued liabilities and other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under the relevant terms of the Amended Sales Contract, Coeur maintains its exposure to the price of gold and silver and expects to recognize the remaining value of the accrued liability by September 2024.

 Kensington Royalty Matter 
 On March 28, 2024, the Company and its subsidiary Coeur Alaska, Inc. Coeur Alaska entered into a settlement agreement to resolve litigation with Maverix Metals Inc. and Maverix Metals (Nevada) Inc. (collectively Maverix regarding the terms of a royalty impacting a portion of the Kensington mine property (the Maverix Litigation ). While Coeur Alaska continued to believe its claims and counterclaims in the matter were valid, it determined that the settlement was appropriate given the inherent uncertainty presented in litigation matters. In consideration for the dismissal of the Maverix Litigation and pursuant to other customary terms of settlement, Coeur Alaska and Maverix agreed to amend the terms of the royalty to decrease the effective rate of the royalty and to eliminate the concept of cost recoupment provided for in the original royalty. The amended royalty now provides that Coeur Alaska pays a net returns royalty on up to troy ounces of gold produced from the current boundaries of the Kensington mine at a rate of: (i) for production occurring from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 and (ii) for production occurring on or after January 1, 2027. The Company also agreed to issue up to shares of its common stock to an affiliate of Maverix, including common stock having a then-current fair market value of million by April 2, 2024, and common stock having a then-current fair market value of million by March 28, 2025 (collectively, the Settlement Shares ), with a cash-settlement of any shortfall in value if all shares of common stock are issued. The settlement provides that credit for the value of certain portions of equity issued to be credited against the royalty, as amended, as payment in arrears for production prior to January 1, 2024. In April 2024, the Company issued shares to settle the first equity issuance. The issuance of the Settlement Shares is being made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and, in some cases, cash as financial support for various purposes, including environmental remediation, reclamation, collateral for gold and silver hedges and other general corporate purposes. As of

 million and million, respectively, in place as financial support for future reclamation and closure costs. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations and, from time-to-time, the Company may be required to post collateral, including cash or letters of credit which reduce availability under its revolving credit facility, to support these instruments. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. The Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Coeur Mining, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the Company , our , or we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial performance measures in our MD A. For a detailed description of these measures, please see Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures at the end of this Item. We provide Costs applicable to sales CAS allocation, referred to as the co-product method, based on revenue contribution for Palmarejo and Rochester and based on the primary metal, referred to as the by-product method, for Wharf. Revenue from secondary metal, such as silver at Wharf, is treated as a cost credit. 
 Overview 
 We are primarily a gold and silver producer with operating assets located in the United States and Mexico and an exploration project in Canada. 
 Third Quarter Highlights 
 For the quarter, Coeur reported revenue of 313.5 million and cash provided by operating activities of 111.1 million. We reported GAAP net income of 48.7 million, or 0.12 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis 1 , the Company reported EBITDA of 126.0 million and net income of 47.2 million, or 0.12 per diluted share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Coeur reported revenue of 748.6 million and cash provided by operating activities of 110.4 million. We reported GAAP net income of 21.0 million, or 0.05 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis 1 , the Company reported EBITDA of 222.8 million and net income of 24.7 million or 0.06 per diluted share. 
 
 Strong production increases and lower costs across the portfolio Higher production at all four operations drove a 21 increase in gold production and 15 increase in silver production, totaling 94,993 and 3.0 million ounces of gold and silver, respectively. Costs applicable to sales per gold and silver ounce both declined 12 compared to the prior quarter, leading to margins more than double the prior period. Based on strong year-to-date production and cost performance, the Company reaffirmed its full-year guidance ranges 
 Robust quarterly financial performance driven by higher production and metals prices Revenue of 313 million and adjusted EBITDA 1 of 126 million increased 41 and 140 quarter-over-quarter, respectively. Operating cash flow totaled 111 million and free cash flow reached 69 million during the quarter, their highest levels in over a decade. Net income was 49 million and Adjusted EBITDA 1 over the last twelve months LTM increased 2.5x to 287 million compared to a year ago 
 Rochester remains on-track to achieve year-end throughput and production guidance The recently expanded Rochester silver and gold operation placed approximately 7.1 million tons under leach during the quarter leading to production of 1.2 million ounces of silver and 9,690 ounces of gold, representing quarter-over-quarter increases of 19 and 21 , respectively. The Company has reaffirmed full-year Rochester production guidance ranges and expects approximately 7.0 - 8.0 million tons to be placed under leach in the fourth quarter 
 Announced acquisition of SilverCrest to create leading global silver company On October 4, 2024, Coeur announced an agreement to acquire SilverCrest Metals Inc. SilverCrest in an all-stock transaction with an implied value of approximately 1.7 billion as of the announcement date. The acquisition is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2025 and is expected to materially enhance the Company s cost and cash flow profile and immediately accelerate the Company s balance sheet de-leveraging initiative 
 Debt reduction initiative underway During the third quarter, the Company reduced its outstanding revolving credit facility RCF balance by 50 million to 225 million, leading to total liquidity of 222 million, including 77 million of cash, and a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 2.0x for the first time in three years

Consolidated Financial Results 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Three Months June 30, 2024 
 Revenue 
 We sold 96,913 gold ounces and 3.0 million silver ounces, compared to 76,932 gold ounces and 2.6 million silver ounces. Revenue increased by 91.5 million, or 41 , as a result of a 15 and 14 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively, and a 26 and 16 increase in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively. The Company benefited from higher gold and silver spot prices. The increase in gold ounces sold was due to higher gold production at all sites, specifically higher grade and recovery rates at Palmarejo, the successful completion of the ramp-up of the new three-stage crusher and increased production from the new leach pad at Rochester, and higher tons and grade placed on pads at Wharf. The increase in silver ounces sold was due to higher grade and recovery at Palmarejo and the successful completion of the ramp-up of the new three-stage crusher and increased production from the new leach pad at Rochester. Gold and silver represented 71 and 29 of third quarter 2024 sales revenue, respectively, compared to 69 and 31 of second quarter 2024 sales revenue, respectively.

 Costs Applicable to Sales 
 Costs applicable to sales increased 12.0 million, or 8 , primarily due to higher gold and silver ounces sold at all sites. For a complete discussion of costs applicable to sales, see Results of Operations below. 
 26 

Amortization 
 Amortization increased 5.3 million, or 19 , and resulted primarily from higher gold and silver ounces sold at all sites. 
 Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 0.3 million, or 2 , primarily due to lower employee incentive related costs. 
 Exploration expense increased 6.7 million, or 52 , driven by the continued surface drilling at Silvertip and higher investment at Palmarejo and Wharf. 
 Pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses remained comparable to the second quarter of 2024. The following table summarizes pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses: 
 Three Months Ended Increase (Decrease) Percentage Change In thousands September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Silvertip ongoing carrying costs 1,675 2,055 (380) (18) Loss on sale of assets 176 640 (464) (73) Asset retirement accretion 4,233 4,154 79 2 Transaction costs 976 976 100 Other 1,523 1,741 (218) (13) Pre-development, reclamation and other expense 8,583 8,590 (7) 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Interest expense (net of capitalized interest of 0.3 million) remained comparable at 13.3 million. 
 Other, net decreased to a gain of 3.4 million compared to 5.1 million primarily due to the receipt of the 1.2 million distribution from the Republic Metal Corporation bankruptcy proceedings (the RMC Bankruptcy Distribution during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Income and Mining Taxes 
 Income and mining tax expense of approximately 25.8 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.6 for three months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to income tax expense of 7.2 million for an effective tax rate of 83.4 for three months ended June 30, 2024. The comparability of the Company s income and mining tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate for the reported periods was impacted by multiple factors, primarily: (i) mining taxes; (ii) variations in our income before income taxes; (iii) geographic distribution of that income; (iv) percentage depletion; (v) foreign exchange rates; and (vi) the impact of uncertain tax positions. Therefore, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, period to period. 
 The following table summarizes the components of the Company s income (loss) before tax and income and mining tax (expense) benefit:

 A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will record or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if it is determined that the Company will ultimately be more likely than not able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of factors that impact the Company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. For additional information, please see Item 1A - Risk Factors . 
 27 

Net Income 
 Net income was 48.7 million, or 0.12 per diluted share, compared to 1.4 million, or 0.00 per diluted share. The increase in net income was driven by a 15 and 14 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively, and a 26 and 16 increase in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively. This was partially offset by higher exploration and income and mining taxes expense. Adjusted net income was 47.2 million, or 0.12 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of 3.4 million, or 0.01 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures ). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 We sold 255,261 gold ounces and 8.2 million silver ounces, compared to 215,971 gold ounces and 7.1 million silver ounces. Revenue increased by 189.4 million, or 34 , as a result of an 18 and 15 increase in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively, and a 16 and 11 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively. The Company benefited from the higher gold and silver spot prices that were partially offset by realized losses from gold and silver hedges in the first half of 2024 compared to realized gains in the prior year. The Company s hedge program was concluded as of June 30, 2024. The increase in gold and silver ounces sold was primarily due to higher gold and silver grades and higher recoveries at Palmarejo, higher mill throughput and grades at Kensington and higher tons placed, grade and timing of recoveries at Wharf. Additionally, Rochester produced higher gold and silver ounces following the successful commissioning and ramp-up of the new three stage crusher at Rochester in 2024 and increased production from the new leach pad. Gold and silver represented 71 and 29 of 2024 sales revenue, respectively, compared to 69 and 31 of 2023 sales revenue, respectively.

 Costs Applicable to Sales 
 Costs applicable to sales increased 6.9 million, or 2 , primarily due to higher gold and silver ounces sold, partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in estimated recoverable ounces on the legacy leach pad and lower adjustments for lower of cost or market LCM at Rochester. For a complete discussion of costs applicable to sales, see Results of Operations below. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization increased 23.3 million, or 36 , primarily due to higher gold and silver ounces sold and the commencement of production of the new leach pad in mid-September 2023 and the three-stage crushing circuit in March 2024 at Rochester, partially offset by lower LCM adjustments at Rochester. 
 Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 5.2 million, or 17 , primarily due to higher employee incentive, outside service and legal costs. 
 Exploration expense increased 22.9 million, or 115 , as a result of planned drilling activity at Palmarejo, Kensington, Wharf and Silvertip. 
 Pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses increased 5.5 million, or 18 , stemming from the Kensington royalty settlement of 6.8 million and higher losses on the sale of assets, partially offset by lower ongoing carrying costs at Silvertip. 
 The following table summarizes pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses:

 Other Income and Expenses 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a 0.4 million gain in connection with the exchange of 5.9 million in aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest of 2029 Senior Notes for 1.8 million shares of common stock compared to 3.7 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company did not have fair value adjustments, net, in the first nine months of 2024 following the sale of the Company s equity investments in 2023. 
 Interest expense (net of capitalized interest of 0.7 million) increased to 39.4 million from 21.7 million due to higher interest paid under the RCF attributable to higher average debt levels, and lower capitalized interest, partially offset by lower interest paid under the 2029 Senior Notes. 
 Other, net increased to a gain of 11.3 million compared to a loss of 10.1 million as a result of the recognition of the FT Premium Liability income of 5.2 million following the renouncement of Silvertip exploration expenditures and the 12.3 million loss recognized from the sale of the La Preciosa Deferred Consideration in 2023. 
 Income and Mining Taxes 
 
 During the nine months of 2024, income and mining tax expense of approximately 49.0 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 70.0 for 2024. This compares to income tax expense of 26.7 million for an effective tax rate of (51.9) for 2023. The comparability of the Company s income and mining tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate for the reported periods was impacted by multiple factors, primarily: (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) mining taxes; (iv) foreign exchange rates; (v) the sale of non-core assets; (vi) percentage depletion; and (vii) the impact of uncertain tax positions. Therefore, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, period to period.

Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income was 21.0 million, or 0.05 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of 78.1 million, or 0.24 per diluted share. The increase in net income was driven by a 18 and 15 increase in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively, a 16 and 11 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively, lower ongoing costs at Silvertip, the recognition of the FT Premium Liability income of 5.2 million, lower LCM adjustments at Rochester, and the 12.3 million loss recognized from the sale of the La Preciosa Deferred Consideration in 2023. This was partially offset by the Kensington royalty settlement of 6.8 million, higher exploration, general and administrative, interest expense and income and mining tax expense, and favorable changes in the fair value of the Company s equity investments in the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted net income was 24.7 million, or 0.06 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of 71.8 million, or 0.22 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures ).

Ongoing carrying costs at Silvertip totaled 6.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 13.6 million in 2023. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 totaled 1.9 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 78.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and 145.4 million available under the RCF. Future borrowing under the RCF may be subject to certain financial covenants. Cash and cash equivalents increased 15.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an 18 and 15 increase in gold and silver ounces sold, respectively, a 16 and 11 increase in average realized gold and silver prices, respectively, the net proceeds of 23.7 million from the sale of 7.7 million shares of common stock in the Private Placement Offering (as defined below), and net draws of 50.0 million under the RCF. This was partially offset by 135.5 million of capital expenditures primarily related to the completion of the Rochester expansion project, and the initial payment of 10.0 million due at closing for the 25.0 million acquisition of mining concessions at Palmarejo. 
 On February 21, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to extend and enhance its RCF (the February 2024 Amendment ). The February 2024 Amendment, among other things, (1) extends the term of the RCF by approximately two years so that it now matures in February 2027, (2) increases the RCF by 10 million from 390 million to 400 million, (3) adds F d ration Des Caisses Desjardins Du Qu bec and National Bank of Canada as lenders on the RCF, (4) permits the Company to obtain one or more increases of the RCF in an aggregate amount of up to 100 million in incremental loans and commitments, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from relevant lenders to provide such increase, (5) allows for unencumbered domestic cash to be included in the calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio, and (6) allows up to 15 million of non-capitalized underground mine development costs related to Silvertip to be excluded from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the RCF. 
 In March 2024, the Company completed the sale of 7,704,725 shares of its common stock Private Placement Offering issued as flow-through shares as defined in subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the FT Shares ), raising net proceeds of approximately 23.7 million, of which 0.9 million represents net proceeds received in excess of the Company s average price FT Premium Liability ). The proceeds of the issuance of FT Shares will be used by the Company for certain qualifying Canadian Exploration Expenditures (as such term is defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada)), in conducting an exploration and mineral resource evaluation program on the Silvertip property in British Columbia and Yukon to determine the existence, location, extent, and quality of the silver, lead, and zinc on the Silvertip property. 
 The Company had no outstanding forward contracts at September 30, 2024 following the final settlement in June 2024. The Company has no current plans to implement new hedges but may in the future add new hedges as circumstances warrant. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company exchanged 5.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 2029 Senior Notes plus accrued interest for 1.8 million shares of its common stock.

We currently believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and longer-term. We expect to use a combination of cash provided by operating activities additional equity financing, and borrowings under our RCF depending on future commodity prices to fund near term capital requirements, including those described in this Report for our 2024 capital expenditure guidance. Our longer-term plans contemplate the expansion and restart of Silvertip, as well as the continued exploration to extend mine lives at all of our operating sites. Our long-term target leverage of Net Debt to the Last Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA is 0.0 times Adjusted EBITDA . Our current leverage ratio is 1.8 times Adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2024. 
 We also have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. 
 If and to the extent liquidity resources are insufficient to support short- and long-term expenditures, we may need to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities, among other financing options, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. This could have a material adverse impact on the Company, as discussed in more detail under Item 1A Risk Factors .

Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Developments 
 See Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in the 2023 10-K and Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in this Report for the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 Ore on Leach Pads 
 The heap leach process extracts silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in metallurgical processes. The Company uses several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed on the leach pads. As the ore body is drilled in preparation for the blasting process, samples are taken of the drill residue which are assayed to determine estimated quantities of contained metal. The Company then processes the ore through crushing facilities where the output is again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgical reconciliation with the data collected from the mining operation is completed with appropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. The crushed ore is then transported to the leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collected from the leach pads, it is continuously sampled for assaying. The quantity of leach solution is measured by flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. After precipitation, the product is converted to dor at the Rochester mine and a form of gold electrolytic cathodic sludge at the Wharf mine, representing the final product produced by each mine. The inventory is stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method. 
 
 The historical cost of metal expected to be extracted within 12 months is classified as current and the historical cost of metals contained within the broken ore expected to be extracted beyond 12 months is classified as non-current. Ore on leach pads is valued based on actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through the leach process. 
 
 36 

The estimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time and the quantity of metal that may be extracted relative to the time the leach process occurs requires the use of estimates, which are inherently inaccurate due to the nature of the leaching process. The quantities of metal contained in the ore are based upon actual weights and assay analysis. The rate at which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is based upon laboratory testing and actual experience of more than 20 years of leach pad operations at the Rochester mine and 30 years of leach pad operations at the Wharf mine. The assumptions used by the Company to measure metal content during each stage of the inventory conversion process includes estimated recovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. The Company periodically reviews its estimates compared to actual experience and revises its estimates when appropriate. The ultimate recovery will not be known until leaching operations cease. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed a review of the estimated recoverable ounces of gold and silver on its leach pads and determined that as a result of longer expected leach time and favorable recoveries relative to previous estimates that the estimated recoverable gold and silver on the Rochester legacy (Stages 2, 3 and 4) leach pads supported an upward revision. An additional 6,000 ounces of gold and 900,000 ounces of silver were added to the legacy leach pads in the first quarter of 2024. There are five reusable heap leach pads (load/offload) used at Wharf. Each pad goes through an approximate 24-month process of loading of ore, leaching and offloading which includes a neutralization and denitrification process. During the leaching cycle of each pad, revised estimated recoverable ounces for each of the pads may result in an upward or downward revision from time to time, which have not historically been significant. The updated recoverable ounce estimate is considered a change in estimate and was accounted for prospectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s estimated recoverable ounces of gold and silver on the leach pads were 48,175 and 6.7 million, respectively. 

Other Liquidity Matters 
 We believe that our liquidity and capital resources in the U.S. are adequate to fund our U.S. operations and corporate activities. The Company has asserted a partial indefinite reinvestment of earnings from its Mexican operations as determined by management s judgment about, and intentions concerning, the future operations of the Company. The Company does not believe that the amounts reinvested will have a material impact on liquidity. 
 In order to reduce indebtedness, fund future cash interest payments and/or amounts due at maturity or upon redemption and for general working capital purposes, from time-to-time we may (1) issue equity securities for cash in public or private offerings or (2) repurchase certain of our debt securities for cash or in exchange for other securities, which may include secured or unsecured notes or equity, in each case in open market or privately negotiated transactions. We evaluate any such transactions in light of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be significant and any debt repurchase transactions may occur at a substantial discount to the debt securities face amount.

 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 
 Management uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company s operating performance, and to plan and forecast its operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. Management s determination of the components of Adjusted net income (loss are evaluated periodically and is based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. The tax effect of adjustments are based on statutory tax rates and the Company s tax attributes, including the impact through the Company s valuation allowance. The combined effective rate of tax adjustments may not be consistent with the statutory tax rates or the Company s effective tax rate due to jurisdictional tax attributes and related valuation allowance impacts which may minimize the tax effect of certain adjustments and may not apply to gains and losses equally. Adjusted net income (loss) is reconciled to Net income (loss) in the following table:

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, tax effect of adjustments of 1.4 million 333 are primarily related to the RMC Bankruptcy Distribution. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, tax effect of adjustments of 1.0 million (-10 are primarily related to the RMC Bankruptcy Distribution, Kensington royalty settlement, nonrecurring expenses at Palmarejo, and LCM adjustment recorded at Rochester. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, tax effect of adjustments of 1.4 million (-25 are primarily related to the fair value adjustments on the Company s equity investments, loss on the sale of the La Preciosa Deferred Consideration and LCM adjustment recorded at Rochester. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Management uses EBITDA to evaluate the Company s operating performance, to plan and forecast its operations, and assess leverage levels and liquidity measures. The Company believes the use of EBITDA reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used in the indenture governing the 2029 Senior Notes and the RCF to determine our ability to make certain payments and incur additional indebtedness. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, Net income (Loss) or Cash Flow from Operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and those calculations may not be comparable to our presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to Net income (loss) in the following table:

 Free Cash Flow 
 Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities less Capital expenditures as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow , a non-GAAP financial measure, to Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow.

 Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital 
 Management uses Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is Cash Provided By (used in) Operating Activities excluding the change in Receivables , Prepaid expenses and other , Inventories and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of Operating Cash Flow Before Changes in Working Capital is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.

 Net Debt and Leverage Ratio 
 Management defines Net Debt , a non-GAAP financial measure, as Total Debt , less Cash and Cash Equivalents . We define Leverage Ratio , a non-GAAP financial measure, as the ratio of Net Debt to the Last Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA . Management believes Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are important measures to monitor our financial flexibility and evaluate the strength of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net Debt and Leverage Ratio have limitations as analytical tools and may vary from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Net Debt and Leverage Ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of Total Debt , the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Net Debt for each of the periods presented.

Costs Applicable to Sales 
 Management uses CAS to evaluate the Company s current operating performance and life of mine performance from discovery through reclamation. We believe these measures assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing gold and silver, assessing our operating performance and ability to generate free cash flow from operations and sustaining production. These measures may not be indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Management believes that allocating CAS to gold and silver based on gold and silver metal sales relative to total metal sales best allows management, analysts, investors and other stakeholders to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. Other companies may calculate CAS differently as a result of reflecting the benefit from selling non-silver metals as a by-product credit, converting to silver equivalent ounces, and differences in underlying accounting principles and accounting frameworks such as in IFRS Accounting Standards.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to various market risks as a part of its operations and engages in risk management strategies to mitigate these risks. The Company continually evaluates the potential benefits of engaging in these strategies based on current market conditions. The Company does not actively engage in the practice of trading derivative instruments for profit. Additional information about the Company s derivative financial instruments may be found in Note 12 -- Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion of the Company s market risk assessments contains forward looking statements . For additional information regarding forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company, please refer to Item 2 of this Report - Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results and actions could differ materially from those discussed below. 
 Gold and Silver Prices 
 Gold and silver prices may fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as U.S. dollar strength or weakness, demand, investor sentiment, inflation or deflation, and global mine production. The Company s profitability and cash flow may be significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold and silver. 
 Decreases in the market price of gold and silver can also significantly affect the value of our metal inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as significantly impact our carrying value of long-lived assets. 
 Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our stockpiles, leach pads and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and metal inventory adjustments at September 30, 2024 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a short-term and long-term gold price of 2,474 and 2,017 per ounce, respectively, and a short-term and long-term silver price of 29.43 and 25.78 per ounce, respectively. 
 The net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 
 44 

Hedging 
 To mitigate the risks associated with metal price fluctuations, the Company may enter into option contracts to hedge future production. The Company had forward contracts for gold and silver that settled monthly through June 2024 in order to protect cash flow during the Rochester expansion ramp-up. The contracts are generally net cash settled and, if the spot price of gold at the time of expiration is lower than the fixed price or higher than the fixed prices, it would result in a realized gain or loss, respectively. The forward contracts expose us to (i) credit risk in the form of non-performance by counterparties for contracts in which the contract price is below the spot price of a commodity, and (ii) price risk to the extent that the spot price exceeds the contract price for quantities of our production covered under contract positions. To reduce counter-party credit exposure, the Company enters into contracts with institutions management deems credit-worthy and limits credit exposure to each institution. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties. For additional information, please see the section titled Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Report. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss of 12.9 million and 4.3 million related to expired gold and silver contracts, respectively. The Company had no outstanding gold or silver hedging contracts at September 30, 2024. 
 Provisional Metal Sales 
 The Company enters into sales contracts with third-party smelters and refiners which, in some cases, provide for a provisional payment based upon preliminary assays and quoted metal prices. The provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract. Depending on the difference between the price at the time of sale and the final settlement price, embedded derivatives are recorded as either a derivative asset or liability. The embedded derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, as a result, are marked to the market gold and silver price at the end of each period from the provisional sale date to the date of final settlement. The mark-to-market gains and losses are recorded in earnings. At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding provisionally priced sales of 12,213 ounces of gold at an average price of 2,568. Changes in gold prices resulted in provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. A 10 change in realized gold prices would cause revenue to vary by 3.1 million. 
 Foreign Currency 
 The Company operates, or has mineral interests, in several foreign countries including Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand, which exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Foreign currency exchange rates are influenced by world market factors beyond the Company s control, such as supply and demand for U.S. and foreign currencies and related monetary and fiscal policies. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may significantly impact profitability and cash flow. 
 Foreign Exchange Hedging 
 To manage foreign currency risk, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts. In 2020, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage this risk and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign denominated transactions. The Company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at September 30, 2024.

 The Company may use financial instruments to manage exposures to changes in interest rates on loans, which exposes it to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the counterparty and, therefore, it does not pose credit risk. The Company seeks to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with what it believes are high-quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps at September 30, 2024. 
 Investment Risk 
 Equity Price Risk 
 The Company had no equity securities at September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 45 

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 
 The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Based upon the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 16 -- Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Item 1A -- Risk Factors of the 2023 10-K sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or operating results. Those risk factors have been supplemented and updated in the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the Q1 2024 10-Q ), in the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (the Q2 2024 10-Q and in this Form 10-Q. Except as supplemented and updated in the Q1 2024 10-Q, Q2 2024 10-Q and below, the risk factors set forth in the 2023 10-K remain current . Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently know or that it currently deems immaterial also may impair our business operations. 
 Risks Relating to the Proposed Acquisition of SilverCrest Metals Inc. 
 As disclosed in this Form 10-Q, including in Part 1, Item 1, Note 6 Property, Plant and Equipment and Mining Properties, Net and Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company entered into an definitive agreement (the Arrangement Agreement on October 3, 2024 whereby, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coeur will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of SilverCrest Metals Inc. SilverCrest pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the Transaction ). There can be no assurance that the Transaction will be completed as expected, in a timely manner or at all. As described below, the Transaction could subject us to significant risks. 
 The Transaction is subject to a number of conditions which may delay its consummation and could result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the anticipated benefits, or result in termination of the Arrangement Agreement and Coeur having to pay a termination fee. 
 The Transaction is conditional upon, among other closing conditions, approval of the plan of arrangement by a British Columbia court, approval by shareholders of both Coeur and SilverCrest, including by Coeur s stockholders to amend Coeur s certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized stock of the Coeur and to approve the issuance of Coeur common stock to be exchanged as consideration for SilverCrest s outstanding stock, and approval of the listing of the Coeur common shares to be issued under the Transaction on the NYSE. Additionally, the Transaction is subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including approval by Mexico s antitrust authority, the Federal Economic Competition Commission COFECE ). Many of the conditions to completion of the Transaction are not within our control and we cannot predict when, or if, these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to the outside date set out in the Arrangement Agreement, it is possible that the Arrangement Agreement may be terminated. 
 Although Coeur and SilverCrest have, subject to certain limitations, agreed to use reasonable best efforts to complete the Transaction promptly, these and other conditions may fail to be satisfied. In addition, completion of the Transaction may take longer and could cost more than we expect. The requirements for obtaining the required regulatory approvals and clearances could delay the completion of the Transaction for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring. Any delay in completing the Transaction may adversely affect the benefits that Coeur expects to achieve if the Transaction and the integration of businesses were to be completed within the expected timeframe. 
 Each of Coeur and SilverCrest have certain rights to terminate the Transaction in certain circumstances, including if any closing conditions are not satisfied prior to the outside date set out in the Arrangement Agreement. Although the Arrangement Agreement contains customary deal protection provisions, a change in recommendation by either Coeur s Board of Directors, the SilverCrest Board of Directors, or both, including as the result of receiving a superior proposal as defined in the Arrangement Agreement, may result in the Transaction not being consummated. The Arrangement Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Arrangement Agreement under certain circumstances, Coeur would be required to pay SilverCrest a termination fee of 100 million and reimburse SilverCrest for expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction. Failure to complete the Transaction in a timely manner, or at all, and payment of relevant termination fees, if applicable, could negatively impact Coeur s business and negatively impact the trading price of Coeur s common stock. 
 Coeur and SilverCrest may be the targets of legal claims, securities class actions, derivative lawsuits and other claims and negative publicity related to the Transaction. 
 47 

Coeur and SilverCrest may be the target of lawsuits that could delay or prevent the Transaction from being consummated or result in significant additional costs. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into an agreement to acquire a public company or to be acquired. Third parties may also attempt to bring claims against Coeur or SilverCrest in an attempt to delay or block the consummation of the Transaction or to seek other remedy, including additional monetary compensation. Even if the lawsuits are unsuccessful or meritless, significant financial resources and attention from management can be required to defend against these claims and proceedings may result in a delay to closing the Transaction. Such proceedings, among other events, could also subject the Company to negative press coverage or public scrutiny that could impact the ability of Coeur and SilverCrest to consummate the Transaction, as well as negatively impacting the Company s existing business performance and operations. 
 Lawsuits that may be brought against Coeur, SilverCrest or their respective directors which could seek, among other things, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including a request to rescind parts of the Arrangement Agreement already implemented and to otherwise enjoin the parties from consummating the Transaction. One of the conditions to the closing of the Transaction is that no law (including injunction or judgements) is in effect that makes the Transaction illegal or enjoins or prohibits Coeur or SilverCrest from consummating the Transaction. Consequently, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Transaction, that injunction may delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all, which may adversely affect Coeur s and SilverCrest s respective business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, political and public attitudes towards the Transaction could result in negative press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Coeur or SilverCrest. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on indigenous communities. Local communities and stakeholders could become dissatisfied with our activities or with change in personnel following the Transaction. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements could lead to investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims or otherwise negatively impact the ability of the combined company to take advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the combined company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The issuance of a significant number of shares of Coeur common stock and a resulting "market overhang" could adversely affect the market price of our shares after completion of the Transaction. 
 At consummation of the Transaction, Coeur will issue shares of its common stock as consideration for the exchange of SilverCrest s outstanding shares. The increase to the number of outstanding shares of Coeur s common stock may impact the marketplace s view of Coeur s common stock and may lead to adverse changes in the stock s trading volume and trading price. Conversely, failure to consummate the Transaction may also result in changes to the marketplace s perception of our business and future strategy that adversely impact our stock s trading volume and trading price. 
 Coeur is expected to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Transaction, which may exceed those anticipated by Coeur. 
 Coeur expects to continue to incur costs related to the Transaction, as well as additional integration costs if the Transaction is completed. Such fees and expenses include, but are not limited to, financial advisor fees, legal fees, tax and accounting fees, filing and regulatory fees, soliciting fees, and other advisory services fees. Certain of these fees will be incurred regardless of whether the Transaction is completed, while additional fees will be incurred after closing of the Transaction, including for the integration of SilverCrest into Coeur. The timing and amount of fees and expenses to be incurred for the Transaction and post-closing integration of the companies is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our initial projections. 
 The combined company may be unable to integrate the businesses of Coeur and SilverCrest successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. 
 The Company has entered into the Arrangement Agreement with the expectation that the Transaction will result in certain benefits for the combined company. These anticipated benefits are dependent, in part, on the successful integration of SilverCrest into Coeur, which is a complex process that includes strategic decisions on, among other factors, business strategy, staffing, and system integration. Coeur will not have the ability to exercise control over SilverCrest or its operations until the Transaction is completed. SilverCrest s business and results of operations may be adversely impacted by events that are outside of our control prior to the completion of the Transaction and may adversely impact integration efforts or the financial results of the combined company after the Transaction is completed. The combined company s performance may be adversely impacted if post-closing integration efforts are not able to be achieved in a timely manner or if the efficiencies and benefits contemplated are not able to be realized. Additionally, management focus on integration matters could result in less attention on the Company s existing operations that could impact the performance of the Company s existing business. 
 48 

SilverCrest s public filings are subject to Canadian disclosure standards, which differ from SEC disclosure requirements. 
 Coeur and SilverCrest report financial results and mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates under different reporting standards. Coeur prepares its financial statements in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ), while SilverCrest prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IFRS Accounting Standards ). Coeur s mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates have been prepared in accordance with Item 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K, while SilverCrest s mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates have been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects NI 43-101 ). These varying standards embody different approaches and definitions that could require adjustments, reclassifications, or other different treatment as SilverCrest s financial statements and mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are conformed to the standards applicable to the Company, including U.S. GAAP and Item 1300 of SEC Regulation S-K. Furthermore, we have not been involved in the preparation of SilverCrest s financial statements or its mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates. Although Coeur and its advisors have conducted due diligence on SilverCrest, there can be no guarantee that Coeur is aware of all relevant information, including all potential liabilities of SilverCrest. Consummation of the Transaction and integration of SilverCrest may pose special risks, including one-time write-offs and unanticipated costs. Mineral reserve and resource estimates may be subject to adjustments that differ from the Company s current expectations and be impacted by a number of factors, including different engineering and geological interpretations and judgements and different pricing assumptions. As a result, it is possible that certain benefits expected from the combination of Coeur and SilverCrest may not be realized. 
 The combined company will be an international company and will be exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations. 
 The Company s operations in Mexico currently expose us to certain economic and operational risks as disclosed in Item 1A Risk Factors of the 2023 10-K. However, upon consummation of the Transaction, the Company s exposure to those risks will increase due to the addition of SilverCrest s operation in Mexico. Increased exposure to currency exchange movements, local economic conditions, local security concerns, and social and political risks associated with foreign operations could result in significant negative impacts on the Company, including to its future results of operations. 
 The trading price and volume of Coeur common stock may be volatile following the Transaction. 
 The trading price and volume of Coeur common stock may be volatile following completion of the Transaction. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock following combination of the companies. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Following the Transaction, many factors may impair the market for Coeur common stock and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price and could also cause the market price and demand for Coeur common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of Coeur common stock. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of Coeur or its stockholders. 
 The consummation of the Transaction may result in one or more ratings organizations taking actions which may adversely affect Coeur's business, financial condition and operating results, as well as the market price of our common stock. 
 Rating organizations regularly analyze the financial performance and condition of companies and may reevaluate Coeur s credit ratings following the consummation of the Transaction. Factors that may impact Coeur's credit ratings following consummation of the Transaction include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth, opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. If a ratings downgrade were to occur in connection with the Transaction, Coeur could experience higher borrowing costs in the future and more restrictive covenants which would reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect following the consummation of the Transaction for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. 
 The market price of our common stock may decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Transaction and may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected or currently affect the market price of our common stock. 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the Transaction and holders of our common stock could lose some or all of the value of their investment. If the Transaction is consummated, Coeur will issue shares of Coeur common stock to former SilverCrest shareholders. The Arrangement Agreement contains no restrictions on the ability of former SilverCrest shareholders to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares following completion of the Transaction. Former SilverCrest shareholders may decide not to hold the shares of Coeur common stock that they receive in 
 49 

the Transaction, and Coeur s historic stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in Coeur as a result of the changes to Coeur s investment profile as a result of the Transaction. These sales of our common stock (or the perception that these sales may occur) could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. In addition, Coeur s financial position after completion of the Transaction may differ from its financial position before the completion of the Transaction, and the results of Coeur s operations and cash flows after the completion of the Transaction may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting its financial position or results of operations and cash flows, all of which could adversely affect the market price of Coeur common stock. Accordingly, the market price and performance of Coeur common stock is likely to be different from the performance of Coeur common stock prior to the Transaction. Furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which, if they continue to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, Coeur common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. 
 The Las Chispas mine may become economically unfeasible. 
 As a result of the Transaction, Coeur s business will be expanded to include the Las Chispas mine at 84656 Arizpe, Sonora, Mexico. There are risks inherent in operating a precious metals mine. The commercial viability of the Las Chsiaps operation hinges on various elements, including mining and processing costs, deposit characteristics such as size, grade, and infrastructure accessibility, as well as the cyclical nature of metal prices and governmental regulations. Factors such as weather events, permit issues, infrastructure failures, and community-related concerns also pose threats to Las Chispas. While the precise impact of these factors is uncertain, their convergence could render the Las Chispas mine economically unfeasible, potentially leading to closure. 
 The pendency of the Transaction may cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Parties with which we and SilverCrest do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, SilverCrest or the combined company. Our and SilverCrest s relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we and SilverCrest have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or SilverCrest, as applicable, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or SilverCrest. In addition, our current and prospective associates may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel and key management and other employees may be difficult to retain or may become distracted from day-to-day operations because matters related to the Transaction may require substantial commitments of their time and resources. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of Coeur, SilverCrest or the combined company following the completion of the Transaction, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected benefits of the Transaction. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Transaction or the termination of the Arrangement Agreement.
