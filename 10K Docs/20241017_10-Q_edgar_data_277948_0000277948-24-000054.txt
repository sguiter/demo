 (a) See Note 11, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements. 
 
 Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and common stock equivalents adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments. CSX's potentially dilutive instruments are made up of equity awards including employee stock options, performance units and restricted stock units. 
 
 When calculating diluted earnings per share, the potential shares that would be outstanding if all outstanding stock options were exercised are included. This number is different from outstanding stock options because it is offset by shares CSX could repurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical exercises to obtain the common stock equivalent.

billion share repurchase program approved in October 2023. Total repurchase authority remaining was billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods including, but not limited to, open market purchases, purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases and negotiated block purchases. The timing of share repurchases depends upon management's assessment of marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. In accordance with the Equity Topic in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings. 
 
 Cost of Shares (Dollars in Millions) 

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a nondeductible 1 excise tax on the net value of most share repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Excise tax commensurate with net share repurchases is reflected in equity and a corresponding liability for excise taxes payable is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

Payouts for certain executive officers are subject to formulaic upward or downward adjustment by up to , capped at an overall payout of , based upon the Company's total shareholder return relative to specified comparable groups over the performance period.

As defined under the plan, Economic Profit incentivizes strategic investments earning more than management's desired minimum required return and is calculated as CSX s gross cash earnings minus the capital charge on gross operating assets.

 Stock options were granted with terms and vest over in equal installments each year on the anniversary of the grant date. These awards are time-based and are not based upon attainment of performance goals. The fair values of stock option awards were estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

 These liabilities are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC. Actual settlements and claims received could differ, and final outcomes of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Considering the legal defenses currently available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of management that none of these items individually, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, their combined effect could be material in that particular period. 
 
 Casualty 
 Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims primarily related to railroad operations. The Company's self-insured retention amount for casualty claims is million per occurrence as discussed at Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies . Currently, individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. 
 
 Personal Injury 
 Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers Liability Act FELA ). CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. This analysis did not result in a material adjustment to the personal injury reserve in the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023.

environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number o f these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company's land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. 
 
 In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. 
 
 The Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly. Based on management's review process, amounts have been recorded to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in purchased services and other on the consolidated income statements. 
 
 Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the estimated cost of remedial actions currently required. 
 
 Other 
 Other reserves include liabilities for various claims, such as automobile, property, general liability, workers' compensation and longshoremen disability claims.

 million per occurrence for losses from floods and named windstorms and up to million per occurrence for other property losses. For casualty claims, the Company retains all risk up to million per occurrence. As CSX negotiates insurance coverage above its full self-retention amounts, it retains a percentage of risk at various layers of coverage. While the Company believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. 
 
 Legal 
 The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters, environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or property claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcomes of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. 
 
 The Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess of reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be million to million in the aggregate at September 30, 2024. This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate.

oth er U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The class action lawsuits were transferred to federal court in the District of Columbia for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. In 2017, the District Court issued its decision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court s ruling. Although the class was not certified, individual shippers have since brought claims against the railroads, which were also transferred to federal court in the District of Columbia for pre-trial proceedings but before a different judge. In March 2024, the original case was reassigned to the judge in the later-filed case who will now preside over all pre-trial proceedings. The railroads filed motions for summary judgment on July 17, 2024 with briefing to be completed by year-end. 
 
 CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of these matters individually or when aggregated could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.

 CSXT is indemnifying Pharmacia LLC, formerly known as Monsanto Company, ("Pharmacia") for certain liabilities associated with real estate located in Kearny, New Jersey along the Lower Passaic River (the Property ). The Property, which was formerly owned by Pharmacia, is now owned by CSXT. CSXT's indemnification and defense duties arise with respect to several matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the -mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the "Study Area ). CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially responsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA. Pharmacia s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation and cleanup costs of the Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA; (b) litigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties. 
 
 For the lower miles of the Study Area, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency s mandated remedial process in March 2016. Occidental Chemical Corporation ("Occidental") performed the remedial design for the lower -mile portion of the Study Area pursuant to a consent order with EPA. EPA approved the design in May 2024. 
 
 For the remaining upper miles of the Study Area, EPA selected an interim remedy in a Record of Decision dated September 28, 2021. On March 2, 2023, EPA issued an administrative order requiring Occidental to design the interim remedy for the upper miles of the Study Area. 
 
 Potentially responsible parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation and settlement process to assign responsibility related to the lower river and the entire Study Area, respectively. CSXT participated in the EPA-directed allocation and settlement process on behalf of Pharmacia.

other parties alleging they are liable under Section 107(a) of CERCLA for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances and requesting each party, individually or collectively, submit good faith offers to EPA in connection with the entire Study Area. CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, responded to the Notice Letter and submitted a good faith offer to EPA on June 27, 2022, following meetings with a mediator from EPA s Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center. On November 21, 2023, EPA notified the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey that it intended to move to enter a Consent Decree ("CD") with a group of potentially responsible parties. On January 31, 2024, EPA filed a motion to enter a modified CD with potentially responsible parties, requiring payment of million to resolve their liability with respect to the entire Study Area. Pharmacia is not a participant in the CD settlement. On April 1, 2024, Occidental filed its opposition to EPA's motion to enter the CD. Several other non-settling parties, including Pharmacia, filed comments concerning (but not opposing) entry of the CD. Negotiations with EPA and other parties to resolve Pharmacia's liability continue. 
 
 CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia with regard to the Property in litigation filed by Occidental, which is seeking to recover its past and future costs associated with the remediation of the entire Study Area. Alternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all, of the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area. Pharmacia is one of approximately defendants in a federal lawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018, and one of defendants in a federal lawsuit filed by Occidental on March 24, 2023.

 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company had forward starting interest rate swaps, classified as cash flow hedges, that had an aggregate notional value of million at inception. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of million of notes due in 2027. In accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic in the ASC, the Company has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges. Under the terms of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, the reference rate on the swaps were automatically replaced with daily compounded SOFR plus the fallback spread on July 1, 2023, the LIBOR replacement date. As of December 31, 2023, the asset value of the forward starting interest rate swaps was million and was recorded in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Unrealized gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 In fourth quarter 2022, CSX settled a portion equal to million notional value of the cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of million. In second quarter 2023, CSX executed a partial settlement equal to million notional value of the cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of million. In third quarter 2023, CSX partially settled an additional million notional value of the cash flow hedges and received a cash payment of million. The unsettled aggregate notional value of these swaps was million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 In second quarter 2024, CSX executed a final settlement equal to million notional value of the cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of million included in other operating activities on the consolidated cash flow statement. As of September 30, 2024, unsettled aggregate notional value of these swaps remains and there is no related asset or liability.

Third Quarter 2024 
 
 Revenue 
 Total revenue increased 1 in the third quarter 2024 when compared to third quarter 2023, primarily due to higher merchandise and intermodal volumes as well as pricing gains in merchandise. These increases were partially offset by lower coal revenue, which includes the impact of lower global benchmark rates, as well as lower fuel recovery and decreases in other revenue. 
 
 Merchandise Volume 
 Chemicals - Increased due to higher shipments of plastics, crude oil, natural gas liquids and other industrial chemicals. 
 
 Agricultural and Food Products - Increased due to higher shipments of domestic and export grain, as well as higher ethanol shipments. 
 
 Automotive - Decreased due to lower North American vehicle production. 
 
 Minerals - Increased primarily due to higher shipments of cement. 
 
 Forest Products - Increased due to higher shipments of pulpboard and paper. 
 
 Metals and Equipment - Decreased primarily due to lower steel and scrap shipments. 
 
 Fertilizers - Decreased primarily due to declines in long-haul phosphates shipments. 
 
 Intermodal Volume 
 Intermodal volume increased due to international shipments driven by higher east coast port volumes. Domestic shipments were relatively flat as increased transcontinental shipments were offset by the impacts of a continued soft trucking environment. 
 
 Coal Volume 
 Export coal increased due to higher shipments of thermal and metallurgical coal. Domestic coal decreased primarily due to lower shipments of coal to utility plants, as well as lower shipments to river and lake terminals. 
 
 Trucking Revenue 
 Trucking revenue decreased 4 million versus the prior year due to lower fuel and capacity surcharges. 
 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue was 19 million lower, primarily resulting from lower carload demurrage and other items.

Expenses 
 Expenses of 2.3 billion decreased 36 million, or 2 , in third quarter 2024 when compared to the third quarter 2023. 
 
 Labor and Fringe expense increased 45 million due to the following: 
 An increase of 25 million was driven by inflation. 
 Other items increased 20 million, including the impact of higher headcount. 
 
 Purchased Services and Other expense decreased 25 million due to the following: 
 A decrease of 26 million was due to lower casualty-related costs and favorable inventory adjustments. 
 All other net costs increased 1 million as inflation was partially offset by efficiency savings and other items. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization expense increased 13 million as a result of a larger asset base. 
 
 Fuel costs decreased 73 million as a result of a 17 decrease in locomotive fuel prices and improved efficiency. 
 
 Equipment and Other Rents expense decreased 3 million due to several non-significant items. 
 
 Gains/Losses on Property Dispositions decreased to a 1 million loss from a 6 million gain in the prior year. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 3 million primarily due to higher average debt balances. 
 
 Other Income - Net 
 Other income - net increased 2 million due to non-significant items.

 Revenue increased 24 million primarily due to higher merchandise revenue, driven by pricing and volume gains, as well as higher intermodal volume. These increases were partially offset by lower fuel recovery, lower coal revenue, which includes the impact of lower global benchmark rates, as well as decreases in other revenue. 
 
 Total expense increased 69 million primarily due to inflation, higher headcount, higher depreciation and lower insurance recoveries compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings. 
 
 Interest expense increased 20 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances. 
 
 Other income - net decreased 1 million primarily because lower income related to customer finance charges was offset by increases in net pension benefit credits. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 17 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes.

Non-GAAP Measures - Unaudited 
 CSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below. 
 
 Economic Profit 
 Management believes Economic Profit (also referred to as CSX Cash Earnings or CCE) provides an additional perspective to investors about financial returns generated by the business by representing a measure showing profit generated over and above the cost of capital used by the business to generate that profit. Economic Profit is designed to incentivize strategic investments that earn more than management s desired minimum required return and is broadly utilized by management to make investment decisions. Therefore, disclosing Economic Profit on how management performs in this regard provides additional useful information to investors regarding the Company s performance compared to its goals. 
 Economic Profit should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, operating income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic Profit is defined by the Company as Gross Cash Earnings GCE minus the Capital Charge on Gross Operating Assets GOA ). Increases in Economic Profit indicate that the Company is effectively allocating capital and rewarding shareholders by generating returns in excess of the incremental cost of capital associated with reinvestment in the business. 
 GCE is calculated as operating income plus depreciation, amortization and operating lease expense, less unusual items and taxes. The Capital Charge uses a minimum required return multiplied by the GOA. CSX's GOAs include gross properties and other non-cash assets, net of non-interest bearing liabilities. The Company used a 15 tax rate and an 8 required return, for both periods presented, which is consistent with rates used for investment decisions and performance evaluation within those same periods. The tax rate is the approximate equivalent of the Company s actual income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax GCE. The required return rate represents management s desired minimum return on any investment. CSX annually re-evaluates these rates to ensure they accurately represent taxes and a required return in light of internal and external factors and would adjust the rate if the annual review resulted in a preset deviation from the current rates. This focuses the Economic Profit measure on value generated by management instead of external factors, such as legislative tax policy or interest rate volatility.

 (b) Unusual items are defined by management as unique events with greater than 100 million full year operating income impact, consistent with the terms of the Company's long-term incentive plan agreements. There were no unusual items for either period presented. 
 (c) The tax percentage rate was 15 for both periods presented. This rate is applied to the sum of operating income, depreciation, amortization and operating lease expense, and unusual items. 
 (d) Gross operating assets reflects an average of the year-to-date quarters reported for each year presented. 
 (e) The capital charge of 8 for both years is calculated as the minimum return multiplied by gross operating assets. This is an annualized rate equivalent to 2 per quarter. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Management believes that Free Cash Flow ("FCF") is supplemental information useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company s financial performance. More specifically, FCF measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. FCF is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds and advances from pr operty dispositions. FCF should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in FCF before dividends from the prior year of 301 million is primarily due to less cash from operating activities and higher property additions. Cash from operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the impact of 387 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2023 tax year that were previously postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by Hurricane Idalia. Cash from operating activities in the prior year period includes the payment of 238 million for retroactive wages and bonuses, and associated taxes, related to finalized labor agreements.

Operating Statistics (Estimated) 
 The Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, velocity increased by 6 while dwell increased by 7 versus prior year. Carload trip plan performance and intermodal trip plan performance decreased by 2 . The Company continues to focus on operational improvements and executing the operating plan to deliver safe, reliable and efficient service to customers. 
 
 While the personal injury frequency increased in third quarter 2024 compared to the prior year, the FRA train accident rate decreased. Safety is a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers, and communities in which the Company operates.

The Company will continue to report these metrics to the Surface Transportation Board using the prescribed methodology. 
 
 Key Performance Measures Definitions 
 Train Velocity - Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures actual train miles and times of a train movement on CSX's network. 
 Dwell - Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard. 
 Cars Online - Average number of active freight rail cars on lines operated by CSX, excluding rail cars that are being repaired, in storage, those that have been sold, or private cars dwelling at a customer location more than one day. 
 On-Time Origina tions - Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule. 
 On-Time Arrivals - Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. 
 Carload Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured cars (excludes unit trains and other non-scheduled service as well as empty automotive shipments) destined for a customer that complete their scheduled plan at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival or interchange (as applicable). 
 Intermodal Trip Plan Performance - Percent of measured containers (excludes port shipments along with empty containers and other non-scheduled service) destined for a customer that complete their scheduled plan at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicab le). 
 Fuel Efficiency - Gallons of locomotive fuel per 1,000 gross ton-miles. 
 Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's) - The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile. 
 Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's) - The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents. 
 FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index - Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours. 
 FRA Train Accident Rate - Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The following are material changes in the significant cash flows, sources of cash and liquidity, capital investments, consolidated balance sheets and working capital, which provide an update to the discussion included in CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Material Changes in Significant Cash Flows 
 Significant Cash Flows 
 The following chart highlights the operating, investing and financing components of the net increase of 291 million and decrease of 573 million in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

The Company generated 166 million less cash from operating activities primarily driven by 387 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2023 tax year, which were previously postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by Hurricane Idalia. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of prior year payments of 238 million for retroactive wages and bonuses, and associated taxes, related to finalized labor agreements. 
 CSX used 216 million more cash for investing activities primarily as a result of higher property additions consistent with planned capital expenditures and increased acquisition spending, partially offset by higher net sales of short-term investments. 
 The Company used 1.2 billion less cash for financing activities primarily due to lower share repurchases, partially offset by lower net proceeds from debt transactions.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Sources of Cash and Liquidity and Uses of Cash 
 As of the end of third quarter 2024, CSX had 1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. See Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements . 
 
 The Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CSX issued a total of 550 million of long-term debt. 
 
 CSX has a 1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in February 2028. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of 1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program. 
 
 Planned capital investments for 2024 are expected to be approximately 2.5 billion, excluding spending to rebuild parts of the network damaged by hurricanes in late September and early October 2024. This damage as well as related costs and recoveries are still being assessed as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. Spending to sustain core infrastructure with a focus on safety and reliability will also remain a top priority. In addition, management is committed to investments that promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives, which includes investments in locomotives and freight cars. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital 
 Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 Total assets increased 857 million from year end primarily due to a 449 million increase in net property consistent with planned capital expenditures and a 291 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Total liabilities decreased 94 million from year end primarily due to debt repayments of 550 million and 387 million of federal and state tax payments related to the 2023 tax year that were previously postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by Hurricane Idalia. These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of 550 million in long-term debt and 226 million of deferred federal and state estimated tax payments related to the 2024 tax year, which were postponed under tax relief announcements for those impacted by Hurricane Debby. Total shareholders' equity increased 951 million from year end primarily driven by net earnings of 2.7 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of 1.2 billion and dividends paid of 700 million. 
 
 Working capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 136 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase of 872 million since year end is primarily due to cash-generating net earnings and debt issuance proceeds, partially offset by cash paid for property additions, payments for share repurchases and dividend payments as mentioned above. The Company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. The Company continues to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. 
 
 CSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. 
 
 This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. We revised certain prior period financial statements for misstatements between the balance sheet and expense that were determined to be immaterial to previously issued financial statements. See Note 11, Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 LABOR AGREEMENTS 
 Approximately 17,600 of the Company's approximately 23,400 employees are members of a rail labor union. As of December 2, 2022, all 12 rail unions at CSX that participated in national bargaining were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that will remain in effect through December 31, 2024. Collective agreements under the Railway Labor Act do not expire, but continue until amended. Prior to the current agreements becoming amendable, CSX worked with several rail unions on new five-year labor agreements. As of the date of this filing, new agreements have been fully ratified by three rail unions and CSX has one other tentative agreement pending ratification votes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the areas below. For further discussion of CSX's critical accounting estimates, see the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, margins, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes or other financial items; 
 expectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives; 
 expectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity;

 future economic, industry or market conditions or performance and their effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "will," "should," believe, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, preliminary and similar expressions. The Company cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect its good faith beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to it as of the date the forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the timing when, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual performance or results could differ materially from those anticipated by any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the Company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements. The following important factors, in addition to those discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements: 
 
 legislative, regulatory or legal developments involving transportation, including rail or intermodal transportation, the environment, hazardous materials, taxation, international trade and initiatives to further regulate the rail industry; 
 the outcome of litigation, claims and other contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge, environmental matters, taxes, shipper and rate claims subject to adjudication, personal injuries and occupational illnesses; 
 changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation) and the level of demand for products carried by CSXT; 
 natural events such as severe weather conditions, including floods, fire, hurricanes and earthquakes, a pandemic crisis affecting the health of the Company's employees, its shippers or the consumers of goods, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company's operations, systems, property, equipment or supply chain; 
 competition from other modes of freight transportation, such as trucking and competition and consolidation or financial distress within the transportation industry generally; 
 the cost of compliance with laws and regulations that differ from expectations as well as costs, penalties and operational and liquidity impacts associated with noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations; 
 the impact of increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas, including potential effects of high speed rail initiatives, or regulatory changes affecting when CSXT can transport freight or service routes; 
 unanticipated conditions in the financial markets that may affect timely access to capital markets and the cost of capital, as well as management's decisions regarding share repurchases; 
 changes in fuel prices, surcharges for fuel and the availability of fuel; 
 the impact of natural gas prices on coal-fired electricity generation; 
 the impact of global supply and price of seaborne coal on CSXT's export coal market; 
 availability of insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or insufficient insurance coverage to cover claims or damages; 
 the inherent business risks associated with safety and security, including the transportation of hazardous materials or a cybersecurity attack which would threaten the availability and vulnerability of information technology; 
 adverse economic or operational effects from actual or threatened war or terrorist activities and any governmental response; 
 loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees; 
 labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided under Part II, Item 7A (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk) of CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, except as provided below. 
 
 The cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company may be impacted by changes in interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts. The following information together with information included in Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements , describes changes to those contracts since CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the related market risk to CSX. 
 
 In second quarter 2024, CSX executed a final settlement equal to 114 million notional value of the cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of 52 million. The gain associated with the settled portion of these cash flow hedges will continue to be classified in AOCI until the associated debt instrument is issued in the future. No unsettled notional value of these swaps remain as of September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in CSX's periodic SEC reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
