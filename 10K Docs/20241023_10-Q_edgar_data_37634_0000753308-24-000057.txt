FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as may result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, believe, will, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, future, projection, goals, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements) that could have a significant impact on NEE's and/or FPL's operations and financial results, and could cause NEE's and/or FPL's actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of NEE and/or FPL in this combined Form 10-Q, in presentations, on their respective websites, in response to questions or otherwise. 
 
 Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business. 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise. 
 Regulatory decisions that are important to NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory, operational and economic factors. 
 Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale renewable energy, including, but not limited to, tax laws, policies and incentives, renewable portfolio standards and feed-in-tariffs, or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEE and FPL abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, a loss of investments in renewable energy projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised laws or regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations. 
 NEE and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and other standards that may result in capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and may require NEE and FPL to limit or eliminate certain operations. 
 NEE's and FPL's business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Extensive federal regulation of the operations and businesses of NEE and FPL exposes NEE and FPL to significant and increasing compliance costs and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions for compliance failures. 
 Changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected due to adverse results of litigation. 
 Allegations of violations of law by FPL or NEE have the potential to result in fines, penalties, or other sanctions or effects, as well as cause reputational damage for FPL and NEE, and could hamper FPL s and NEE s effectiveness in interacting with governmental authorities. 
 Development and Operational Risks 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget. 
 NEE and FPL face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities. 
 The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 4 

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected by a lack of growth, slower growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage. 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather. 
 Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors, terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NEE's and FPL's business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEE's and FPL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses. 
 NEE invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through NEER s gas infrastructure business. The gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER s gas infrastructure business and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 If supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirement services are not favorable, operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Due to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities, NEER's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolios could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Reductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict the ability of NEE to manage its operational risks, which, in turn, could negatively affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 NEE's and FPL's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against significant losses. 
 If price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior, NEE's and FPL's risk management tools associated with their hedging and trading procedures may not protect against significant losses. 
 If power transmission or natural gas, nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facilities are unavailable or disrupted, the ability for subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited. 
 NEE and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors. 
 NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses or a reduction in operating cash flows if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of derivative contracts or if NEE or FPL is required to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts. 
 NEE and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 NEE's and FPL's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in a material adverse impact to their reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL. 
 NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in OTC markets. 
 NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity. 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida. 
 NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs. 
 NEE's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry. 
 Nuclear Generation Risks 
 The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures. 
 In the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, NEE and FPL could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies. 
 5 

NRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues. 
 The inability to operate any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 NEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. 
 Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks 
 Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NEE's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL. 
 NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity and results of operations, limit the ability of NEE and FPL to grow their business, and increase interest costs. 
 NEE's and FPL's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the companies or to maintain their current credit ratings. 
 Poor market performance and other economic factors could affect NEE's defined benefit pension plan's funded status, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. 
 Poor market performance and other economic factors could adversely affect the asset values of NEE's and FPL's nuclear decommissioning funds, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. 
 Certain of NEE's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may materially adversely affect NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE. 
 NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries. 
 NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE s limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. 
 Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of NEE's common stock. 
 Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEE s and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 These factors should be read together with the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K), and investors should refer to that section of the 2023 Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and NEE and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including, but not limited to, unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement. 
 
 Website Access to SEC Filings. NEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information and materials available on NEE's website (or any of its subsidiaries' or affiliates' websites) are not incorporated by reference into this combined Form 10-Q.

 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K. In the opinion of NEE and FPL management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair financial statement presentation have been made. All adjustments are normal and recurring unless otherwise noted. Certain amounts included in the prior year's condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The results of operations for an interim period generally will not give a true indication of results for the year.

NEE's and FPL's receivables are primarily associated with revenues earned from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER, and consist of both billed and unbilled amounts, which are recorded in customer receivables and other receivables on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration and reflect the differences in timing of revenue recognition and cash collections. For substantially all of NEE's and FPL's receivables, regardless of the type of revenue transaction from which the receivable originated, customer and counterparty credit risk is managed in the same manner and the terms and conditions of payment are similar. 
 
 FPL FPL s revenues are derived primarily from tariff-based sales that result from providing electricity to retail customers in Florida with no defined contractual term. Electricity sales to retail customers account for approximately of FPL s operating revenues, the majority of which are to residential customers. FPL's retail customers receive a bill monthly based on the amount of monthly kWh usage with payment due monthly. For these types of sales, FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and billed to customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. The billed and unbilled amounts represent the value of electricity delivered to the customer. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FPL's unbilled revenues amounted to approximately million and million, respectively, and are included in customer receivables on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through 2041. As of September 30, 2024, FPL expects to record approximately million of revenues related to the fixed capacity price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided. These contracts also contain a variable price component for energy usage which FPL recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.

 Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility, implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the valuation of such contracts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are updated daily to reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data.

 Notional Volumes of Derivative Instruments The following table represents net notional volumes associated with derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated financial statements. The table includes significant volumes of transactions that have minimal exposure to commodity price changes because they are variably priced agreements. These volumes are only an indication of the commodity exposure that is managed through the use of derivatives. They do not represent net physical asset positions or non-derivative positions and the related hedges, nor do they represent NEE s and FPL s net economic exposure, but only the net notional derivative positions that fully or partially hedge the related asset positions.)

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately billion and billion, respectively, and foreign currency contracts with a notional amount of approximately billion and billion, respectively. 
 
 Credit - Risk - Related Contingent Features Certain derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, the requirement to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified credit rating agencies and certain financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross-default and material adverse change triggers. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of NEE's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was approximately billion million for FPL) and billion million for FPL), respectively. 
 
 If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these derivative agreements were triggered, certain subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, could be required to post collateral or settle contracts according to contractual terms which generally allow netting of contracts in offsetting positions. Certain derivative contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers. To the extent these contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger, the maximum exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral posting requirements. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to BBB/Baa2 (a three-level downgrade for FPL and a one level downgrade for NEECH from the current lowest applicable rating), applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately million at FPL) at September 30, 2024 and million at FPL) at December 31, 2023. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately billion million at FPL) at September 30, 2024 and billion million at FPL) at December 31, 2023. Some derivative contracts do not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable NEE subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to

 billion million at FPL) at September 30, 2024 and billion million at FPL) at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Collateral related to derivatives, including amounts posted for margin, current exposures and future performance with exchanges and independent system operators, may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately million at FPL) and million at FPL), respectively, in cash, and million at FPL) and million at FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds, each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities. 
 
 Additionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.

The investments held in the special use funds and other investments consist of equity and available for sale debt securities which are primarily carried at estimated fair value. The amortized cost of debt securities is approximately million million for FPL) and million million for FPL) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Debt securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average maturity at September 30, 2024 of approximately at NEE and at FPL. Other investments primarily consist of debt securities with a weighted-average maturity at September 30, 2024 of approximately . The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. 
 
 For FPL's special use funds, changes in fair value of debt and equity securities, including any estimated credit losses of debt securities, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts, consistent with regulatory treatment. For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, changes in fair value of debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other net in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. Changes in fair value of equity securities are primarily recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds net in NEE s condensed consolidated statements of income.

 Regulations issued by the FERC and the NRC provide general risk management guidelines to protect nuclear decommissioning funds and to allow such funds to earn a reasonable return. The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds. Similar restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee pursuant to New Hampshire law. 
 
 The nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE and FPL and the rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The funds' assets are invested giving consideration to taxes, liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives. 
 
 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements NEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value. Indicators of impairment may include, among other things, an observable market price below NEE s carrying value. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value on the reporting date and an impairment loss is recognized. 
 
 NextEra Energy Resources owns a noncontrolling interest in NEP, primarily through its limited partner interest in NEP OpCo, and accounts for this ownership interest as an equity method investment. During the third quarter of 2023, NEE recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion billion after tax) related to the investment in NEP, which is reflected in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE s condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment reflected NEE s fair value analysis based on the market approach and the significant decline in the observable trading price of NEP s common units at September 30, 2023 of following an announcement of a decrease in NEP s distribution growth rate expectations. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately billion, which was the carrying amount as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the second and third quarters of 2024, NEE evaluated the investment in NEP for impairment because the trading price of NEP's common units had periodically fallen below NEE's carrying value per unit. At September 30, 2024, the trading price of NEP's common units exceeded NEE s carrying value per unit of and NEE has determined that the investment in NEP is not OTTI. In making this conclusion, NEE's analysis considered, among other things, the closing market price per unit on September 30, 2024, the extent to which the market value was less than the carrying value throughout the second and third quarters of 2024, the short duration of impairment, the conditions and trends of the economic cycle, analyst valuation reports, performance and trading yields of NEP and comparable public companies and trends in the general market. Should NEE determine, based on future analysis, that the impairment is other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE s consolidated statements of income, which would impact future results.

 NEE recognizes PTCs as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, which may differ significantly from amounts computed, on a quarterly basis, using an overall effective income tax rate anticipated for the full year. NEE uses this method of recognizing PTCs for specific reasons, including that PTCs are an integral part of the expected value of most wind and some solar projects and a fundamental component of such wind and solar projects' results of operations. PTCs, as well as ITCs, can significantly affect NEE's effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income or loss. The amount of PTCs recognized can be significantly affected by wind and solar generation and by the roll off of PTCs after of production absent a repowering of the wind and solar projects.

 biogas projects, of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities. The purchase price included approximately billion in cash consideration and the assumption of approximately million of debt, excluding post-closing adjustments. 
 
 Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value. NEE acquired identifiable assets of approximately billion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets associated with biogas rights agreements and above-market purchased power agreements, and assumed liabilities of approximately billion and noncontrolling interests of approximately billion. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately billion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's condensed consolidated balance sheets, of which approximately billion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill associated with the RNG acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is included in the clean energy assets reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits of synergies and expansion opportunities for NEE's clean energy businesses.

 billion. Prior to Hurricane Debby, FPL's storm reserve had a balance of approximately million. At September 30, 2024, the estimated recoverable storm restoration costs exceeded the balance of the storm reserve by approximately billion. This deficit has been recorded by FPL as a current regulatory asset on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 In October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the West Coast of Florida and traveled across the peninsula impacting much of FPL's service territory. Although FPL has not finalized its storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Milton, FPL's preliminary estimate of total recoverable storm restoration costs is approximately billion. 
 
 Pursuant to FPL's 2021 rate agreement, storm restoration costs, plus an additional approximately million to replenish the storm reserve, are recoverable from customers through a surcharge. FPL expects to file a petition in fourth quarter 2024 for a surcharge to be recovered over calendar year 2025 of approximately billion. The final storm restoration costs are subject to a prudence review by the FPSC.

 Insurance Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains million of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane Arnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a million private liability insurance limit. Each site, except Duane Arnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to million million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed million million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates million and million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.

NEE participates in co-insurance of of the first million of losses per site per occurrence, except at Duane Arnold. The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair. NEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to million million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates million, million and million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively. 
 
 Due to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 11 - Storm Reserve Deficit. 
 
 In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

OVERVIEW 
 
 NEE s operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal businesses, FPL, which serves approximately 5.9 million customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER, which together with affiliated entities is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2023 MWh produced on a net generation basis, as well as a world leader in battery storage. The table below presents net income (loss) attributable to NEE and earnings (loss) p er share attributable to NEE , assuming dilution, by reportable segment, FPL and NEER . Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as other income and expense items, including interest expense, and eliminating entries, and may include the net effect of rounding. See Note 13 for additional segment information. The foll owing discussions should be read in conjunction with the Notes contained herein and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in the 2023 Form 10 K. The results of operations for an interim period generally will not give a true indication of results for the year. In the following discussions, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year periods.

 Adjusted Earnings 
 
 NEE prepares its financial statements under GAAP. However, management uses earnings adjusted for certain items (adjusted earnings), a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE s employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NEE s management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE's fundamental earnings power. Although these amounts are properly reflected in the determination of net income under GAAP, management believes that the amount and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared under GAAP. 
 
 The following table provides details of the after-tax adjustments to net income considered in computing NEE's adjusted earnings discussed above.

 (a) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 191 million of gains and 127 million of losses, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 44 million and 1,297 million of gains, respectively, are included in NEER's net income (loss); the balance is included in Corporate and Other. The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized. 
 (b) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, includes an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP. See Note 3 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements. 
 
 43 

NEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the condensed consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 2. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Summary 
 
 Net income attributable to NEE increased by 633 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting higher results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by lower results at Corporate and Other. Net income attributable to NEE decreased by 357 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting lower results at Corporate and Other, partly offset by higher results at FPL and NEER. 
 
 FPL's increase in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property. 
 
 NEER's results increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP recorded in 2023, favorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023 and higher earnings from new investments. NEER's results increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in NEP recorded in 2023 and higher earnings from new investments, partly offset by less favorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023. 
 
 Corporate and Other's results decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023. 
 
 NEE's effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0 and (5) , respectively. NEE's effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 3 and 14 , respectively. See Note 4 for a discussion of NEE's and FPL's effective income tax rates. 
 
 FPL: Results of Operations 
 
 Investments in plant in service and other property grew FPL's average rate base by approximately 6.0 billion and 6.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions. 
 
 The use of reserve amortization is permitted by FPL's 2021 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2021 rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC equity and revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately 231 million and reserve amortization of 406 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately 245 million and reserve amortization of 206 million, respectively. See Depreciation and Amortization Expense below. During all periods presented, FPL earned an approximately 11.80 regulatory ROE on its retail rate base, based on a trailing thirteen-month average retail rate base as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. In July 2024, FPL reduced the targeted regulatory ROE for the full-year 2024 to 11.40 . 
 
 FPL completed a twelve-month interim storm restoration charge that began in April 2023 for eligible storm restoration costs of approximately 1.3 billion, primarily related to surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022. 
 
 44 

In the third quarter of 2024, FPL's service territory was impacted by Hurricanes Debby and Helene and FPL incurred recoverable storm restoration costs of approximately 0.3 billion. In October 2024, FPL's service territory was impacted by Hurricane Milton and FPL incurred recoverable storm restoration costs of approximately 0.8 billion. See Note 11 Storm Reserve Deficit. 
 
 In March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL s 2021 rate agreement. An April 2024 appeal of the order filed with the Florida Supreme Court by certain intervenors remains pending. See Note 11 Rate Regulation. In September 2024, the license renewals for Turkey Point Unit No. 3 and Turkey Point Unit No. 4 were approved, extending the operating licenses to 2053 and 2054, respectively. Subsequently, an appeal of the decision dismissing all of the proposed contentions against the subsequent license renewal was filed with the NRC and that appeal is pending. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating revenues decreased 536 million and 1,006 million, respectively, primarily reflecting decreases in storm cost recovery revenues of approximately 486 million and 745 million, respectively, primarily associated with the completion of surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above. Additionally, fuel revenues decreased approximately 110 million and 384 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily relating to lower fuel prices. The decreases in operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were partly offset by increases in retail base revenues of approximately 71 million and 184 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in retail base revenues was primarily related to an increase of approximately 2.1 and 1.9 , respectively, in the average number of customer accounts, partly offset by a decrease of 1.1 and 0.6 , respectively, in the average usage per retail customer driven by unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year periods. 
 
 Fuel, Purchased Power and Interchange Expense 
 Fuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased 131 million and 442 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily reflecting lower fuel prices. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 450 million and 772 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects approximately 486 million of lower amortization of deferred storm cost expenses primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above, partly offset by increased depreciation related to higher plant in service balances. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects approximately 745 million of lower amortization of deferred storm cost expenses primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above, and the impact of reserve amortization, partly offset by increased depreciation related to higher plant in service balances. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately 231 million and 245 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, FPL recorded reserve amortization of approximately 406 million and 206 million, respectively. Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2021 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024, approximately 817 million of reserve amortization remains available under the 2021 rate agreement.

NEER : Results of Operations 
 
 NEER s results increased 1,453 million and 69 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of the changes are in the following table. 
 Increase (Decrease) From Prior Year Period Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (millions) New investments (a)

Results from projects, pipelines and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation or ownership. Project results, including repowered wind projects, are included in existing clean energy, pipeline results are included in gas infrastructure and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in NEET beginning with the thirteenth month of operation or ownership. 
 (b) Excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities. 
 (c) See Overview Adjusted Earnings for additional information. 
 
 New Investments 
 Results from new investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to higher earnings related to new wind and solar generation and battery storage facilities that entered service during or after the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Customer Supply 
 Results from customer supply decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the normalization of origination activity and margins as compared to higher origination activity and margins in the prior year periods. 
 
 Other Factors 
 Supplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's results discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER. 
 
 Operating Revenues 
 Operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 916 million primarily due to: 
 the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately 574 million of gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 346 million of losses for the comparable period in 2023), and 
 revenues from new investments of 148 million, 
 partly offset by, 
 net decreases in revenues of 194 million from the customer supply and gas infrastructure businesses. 
 
 Operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 922 million primarily due to: 
 the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately 341 million of gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,607 million of gains for the comparable period in 2023), and 
 net decreases in revenues of 105 million from the customer supply and gas infrastructure businesses, 
 partly offset by, 
 revenues from new investments of 338 million, and 
 higher revenues from existing clean energy assets of 185 million primarily due the absence of 2023 refueling outages at the Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear facilities. 
 
 46 

Operating Expenses net 
 Operating expenses net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 245 million primarily due to increases of 140 million in depreciation and amortization, 70 million in O M expenses and 28 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. Operating expenses net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 828 million primarily due to increases of 465 million in depreciation and amortization, 227 million in O M expenses and 99 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. The increases for both periods were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses as well as higher depletion and higher O M expenses at the gas infrastructure business. 
 
 Gains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets net 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the changes in gains on disposal of businesses/assets net primarily reflect the September 2024 sales of ownership interests in connection with the pipeline joint venture and the renewable assets joint venture. See Note 11 Disposal of Businesses. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 NEER s interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 507 million reflecting approximately 329 million of unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances. NEER s interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 522 million reflecting approximately 294 million of unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances. 
 
 Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees 
 NEER recognized 237 million and 578 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 954 million and 722 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge in 2023 of approximately 1.2 billion 0.9 billion after tax) related to the investment in NEP (see Note 3 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements). 
 
 Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities Held in NEER's Nuclear Decommissioning Funds net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the fair value of equity securities in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds related to favorable market conditions in 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 PTCs from wind and solar projects and ITCs from solar, battery storage and certain wind projects are included in NEER s earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. NEER's effective income tax rate is primarily based on the composition of pretax income (loss) in the periods presented, as well as the amount of renewable energy tax credits in the periods presented. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, renewable energy tax credits increased by approximately 172 million and 435 million, respectively. See Note 4. 
 
 RNG Acquisition 
 On March 21, 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources acquired a portfolio of renewable energy projects as well as the related service provider. See Note 5 RNG Acquisition. 
 
 Corporate and Other: Results of Operations 
 
 Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70 debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. 
 
 Corporate and Other's results decreased 930 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to unfavorable after-tax impacts of approximately 930 million, as compared to the prior year period, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Corporate and Other's results decreased 718 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to unfavorable after-tax impacts of approximately 743 million, as compared to the prior year period, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. 
 
 47 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 12 Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 5), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 9 and Note 2) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt (see Note 9) and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, the sale of renewable energy tax credits (see Note 11 Income Taxes) and sales of ownership interests in assets/businesses to NEP or third parties (see Note 11 Disposal of Businesses) , c onsistent with NEE s and FPL s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE , FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements. 

Cash Flows 
 
 NEE's sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (millions) Sources of cash:

 Capital Support 
 
 Guarantees, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Indemnifications (Guarantee Arrangements) 
 Certain subsidiaries of NEE issue guarantees and obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as provide indemnities, to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Substantially all of the guarantee arrangements are on behalf of NEE s consolidated subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail below. See Note 6 regarding guarantees of obligations on behalf of NEP subsidiaries. NEE is not required to recognize liabilities associated with guarantee arrangements issued on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that they will be required to perform. At September 30, 2024, NEE believes that there is no material exposure related to these guarantee arrangements. 
 
 NEE subsidiaries issue guarantees related to equity contribution agreements and engineering, procurement and construction agreements, associated with the development, construction and financing of certain power generation facilities (see Note 11 Structured Payables) and a natural gas pipeline project, as well as a related natural gas transportation agreement. Commitments associated with these activities are included in the contracts table in Note 12. 
 
 In addition, at September 30, 2024, NEE subsidiaries had approximately 6.0 billion in guarantees related to obligations under purchased power and acquisition agreements, nuclear-related activities, payment obligations related to PTCs, support for NEER's retail electricity provider activities, as well as other types of contractual obligations (see Note 12 Commitments). 
 
 In some instances, subsidiaries of NEE elect to issue guarantees instead of posting other forms of collateral required under certain financing arrangements, as well as for other project-level cash management activities. At September 30, 2024, these guarantees totaled approximately 1.1 billion and support, among other things, cash management activities, including those related to debt service and operations and maintenance service agreements, as well as other specific project financing requirements. 
 
 50 

Subsidiaries of NEE also issue guarantees to support customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, including the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities. At September 30, 2024, the estimated mark-to-market exposure (the total amount that these subsidiaries of NEE could be required to fund based on energy commodity market prices at September 30, 2024) plus contract settlement net payables, net of collateral posted for obligations under these guarantees, totaled approximately 1.5 billion. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE also had approximately 5.6 billion of standby letters of credit and approximately 1.7 billion of surety bonds to support certain of the commercial activities discussed above. FPL's and NEECH's credit facilities are available to support substantially all of the standby letters of credit. 
 
 In addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of NEE have agreed and in the future may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties, including those associated with asset divestitures, for possible unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited to, an adverse judgment in a lawsuit, or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law. NEE is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments by its subsidiaries under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them to make payments have not occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence. 
 
 NEECH, a 100 owned subsidiary of NEE, provides funding for, and holds ownership interests in, NEE's operating subsidiaries other than FPL. NEE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment. Certain guarantee arrangements described above contain requirements for NEECH and FPL to maintain a specified credit rating. 
 
 NEE fully and unconditionally guarantees NEECH debentures pursuant to a guarantee agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999 (1999 guarantee) and NEECH junior subordinated debentures pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 1, 2006 (2006 guarantee). The 1999 guarantee is an unsecured obligation of NEE and ranks equally and ratably with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of NEE. The 2006 guarantee is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of payment to NEE senior indebtedness (as defined therein). No payment on those junior subordinated debentures may be made under the 2006 guarantee until all NEE senior indebtedness has been paid in full in certain circumstances. NEE s and NEECH s ability to meet their financial obligations are primarily dependent on their subsidiaries net income, cash flows and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE and NEECH. The dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements.

Shelf Registration 
 In March 2024, NEE, NEECH and FPL filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities, which became effective upon filing. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. Securities that may be issued under the registration state ment include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that NEE believes are both most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. NEE s critical accounting policies and estimates were reported in NEE s 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates.

ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY 
 
 NEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE , through NEER , uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Note 2.

The changes in the fair value of NEE's consolidated subsidiaries' energy contract derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Hedges on Owned Assets Trading Non- Qualifying FPL Cost Recovery Clauses NEE Total (millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Fair value of contracts outstanding at June 30, 2024 1,309 (1,733) 39 (385) Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (123) 30 (4) (97) Value of contracts acquired 20 20 Net option premium purchases (issuances) (8) 9 1 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 98 537 (6) 629 Fair value of contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024 1,276 (1,137) 29 168 Net margin cash collateral paid (received) (90) Total mark-to-market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at September 30, 2024 1,276 (1,137) 29 78

 With respect to commodities, NEE's Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is compri sed of certain members of senior management, and NEE 's chief executive officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC and NEE 's chief executive officer receive periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. 
 
 54 

NEE uses a value-at-risk (VaR) model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark-to-market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated loss of market value based on a one-day holding period at a 95 confidence level using historical simulation methodology. The VaR figures are as follows: 
 Trading (a) 
 Non-Qualifying Hedges 
 and Hedges in FPL Cost

 5 5 5 107 106 5 106 105 
 
 (a) The VaR figures for the trading portfolio include positions that are marked to market. Taking into consideration offsetting unmarked non-derivative positions, such as physical inventory, the trading VaR figures were approximately 2 million and 1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (b) Non-qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non-qualifying hedges and hedges in FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 NEE 's and FPL 's financial results are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective outstanding and expected future issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and other investments. NEE and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate contracts and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest rate contracts are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. 
 
 The following are estimates of the fair value of NEE's and FPL's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Carrying Amount Estimated 
 Fair Value (a) 
 Carrying Amount Estimated 
 Fair Value (a) 
 (millions) NEE: Special use funds 2,341 2,341 2,222 2,222 Other investments, primarily debt securities 2,055 2,055 1,802 1,802 Long-term debt, including current portion 73,657 72,495 68,306 64,103 Interest rate contracts net unrealized losses 
 (1,107) (1,107) (249) (249) FPL: Special use funds 1,774 1,774 1,658 1,658 Long-term debt, including current portion 26,741 25,906 25,274 23,430 
 
 (a) See Notes 2 and 3. 
 
 The special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NEE's and FPL's nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value. At FPL, changes in fair value, including any credit losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value for NEE's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for credit losses and unrealized losses on available for sale securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer-term securities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately 30.5 billion to manage exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily associated with expected future and outstanding debt issuances at NEECH and NEER. See Note 2. 
 
 Based upon a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates, the fair value of NEE's net liabilities would increase by approximately 3,107 million 1,144 million for FPL) at September 30, 2024. 
 
 55 

Equity Price Risk 
 
 NEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities. For example, NEE s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately 6,077 million and 5,290 million 4,133 million and 3,536 million for FPL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. NEE's and FPL s investment strategy for equity securities in their nuclear decommissioning reserve funds emphasizes marketable securities which are broadly diversified. At September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 decrease in the prices quoted on stock exchanges would result in an approximately 572 million 381 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment, and for NEE s non-rate regulated operations, a corresponding amount would be recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds net in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income. See Note 3. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 NEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. 
 
 Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NEE s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions , NEE s energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL s energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE s energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include the following: 
 
 Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. 
 Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S. 
 Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC. 
 Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral. 
 Master netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NEE s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties. 
 
 Based on NEE s policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At September 30, 2024 , NEE's credit risk exposure associated with its energy marketing and trading operations, taking into account collateral and contractual netting rights, totaled approximately 2.9 billion 74 million for FPL), of which approxi mately 90 (99 for FPL) was with companies that have investment grade credit ratings. See Note 2. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 See Management's Discussion Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, each of NEE and FPL had performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including NEE's and FPL's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of each company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of each of NEE and FPL concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 NEE and FPL are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and of their internal controls. This results in refinements to processes throughout NEE and FPL . However, there has been no change in NEE's or FPL's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during NEE's and FPL's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NEE's or FPL's internal control over financial reporting. 
 56 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 See Note 12 Legal Proceedings. 
 
 With regard to environmental proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party, NEE's and FPL's policy is to disclose any such proceeding if it is reasonably expected to result in monetary sanctions of greater than or equal to 1 million. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. The factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K, as well as other information set forth in this report, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects should be carefully considered. The risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing NEE and FPL.

ARTICLE I One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series of Bonds 
 Section 1. (I) There shall be a series of bonds designated 5.00 Series due August 1, 2034, herein sometimes referred to as the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series, each of which shall also bear the descriptive title First Mortgage Bond, and the form thereof, which shall be established by Resolution of the Board of Directors of FPL, shall contain suitable provisions with respect to the matters hereinafter in this Section specified. Bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series shall mature on August 1, 2034, and shall be issued as fully registered bonds in denominations of Two Thousand Dollars and, at the option of FPL, in integral multiples of One Thousand Dollars in excess thereof (the exercise of such option to be evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof) they shall bear interest at the rate of 5.00 per annum, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year (each an Interest Payment Date commencing on February 1, 2025 the principal of and interest on each said bond to be payable at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts. Bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series shall be dated as in Section 10 of the Mortgage provided. The record date for payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date shall be the close of business on (1) the Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date so long as all of the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series are held by a securities depository in book-entry only form, or (2) the 15th calendar day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date if any of the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series are not held by a securities depository in book-entry only form. Interest on the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series will accrue from and including July 30, 2024 to but excluding February 1, 2025 and, thereafter, from and including the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (and if no interest has been paid on the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series, from July 30, 2024) to but excluding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. No interest will accrue on a bond of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series for the day on which such bond matures. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of the number of days in the period using 30-day calendar months. If any date on which interest, principal or premium, if any, is payable on the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest, principal or premium payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay. A Business Day is any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions or trust companies in New York City are generally authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.

 Prior to May 1, 2034 (three months prior to the maturity date of the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series) (the Par Call Date ), FPL may redeem the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of 
 (1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the Redemption Date (assuming the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi - annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30 - day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the Redemption Date, and 
 (2) 100 of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series to be redeemed, 
 plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date. 
 On or after the Par Call Date, FPL may redeem the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date. 
 Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the yield determined by FPL in accordance with the following two paragraphs. 
 The Treasury Rate shall be determined by FPL after 4 15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15 (or any successor designation or publication) H.15 under the caption U.S. government securities Treasury constant maturities Nominal (or any successor caption or heading) H.15 TCM ). In determining the Treasury Rate, FPL shall select, as applicable 
 (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the Redemption Date to the Par Call Date (the Remaining Life or 
 - 6 - 

(2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places or 
 (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. 
 For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the Redemption Date. 
 If on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date H.15 TCM is no longer published, FPL shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi - annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11 00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such Redemption Date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date, FPL shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, FPL shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11 00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi - annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11 00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places. 
 FPL s actions and determinations in determining the Redemption Price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 The Trustee shall have no duty to determine, or to verify FPL s calculations of, the Redemption Price. 
 (III) At the option of the registered owner, any bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series, upon surrender thereof for exchange at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, together with a written instrument of transfer wherever required by FPL, duly executed by the registered owner or by his duly authorized attorney, shall (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of bonds of the same series of other authorized denominations. 
 - 7 - 

Bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series shall be transferable (subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Mortgage) at the office or agency of FPL in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. 
 Upon any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series, FPL may make a charge therefor sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge, as provided in Section 12 of the Mortgage, but FPL hereby waives any right to make a charge in addition thereto for any exchange or transfer of bonds of the One Hundred Thirty-Ninth Series.

No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than ninety (90) days after such record date.
