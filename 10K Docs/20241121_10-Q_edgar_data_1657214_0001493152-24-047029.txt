 Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 

investment in Rancho Costa Verde Development LLC RCVD ). RCVD is a -acre master
planned second home, retirement home and vacation home real estate community located on the east coast of Baja California. RCVD is a
self-sustained solar powered green community that takes advantage of the advances in solar and other green technology. On
January 3, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in RCVD for a contractual price of million,
paid through a combination of a promissory note, common stock and common stock purchase warrants. As a result of the transaction, RCVD
became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a business acquisition pursuant to ASC 805 Business
Combinations . 

Certain
information and note disclosures included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles U.S. GAAP or GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2024. For further information, refer to the audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023,
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 27, 2024. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. 

Management
evaluated all relevant conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated
financial statements were available to be issued and determined that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to generate
revenues and raise capital. The Company has faced significant liquidity shortages as shown in the accompanying financial statements.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by approximately million. The Company
has recorded net income of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and has an accumulated deficit of approximately
 million as of September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. 

The
Company continues to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt instruments and equity to fund its ongoing operations, which
may have the effect of potentially diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. 

Management
anticipates that the Company s capital resources will significantly improve if its plots of land gain wider market recognition
and acceptance resulting in increased plot sales and house construction. If the Company is not successful with its marketing efforts
to increase sales, the Company will continue to experience a shortfall in cash, and it will be necessary to obtain funds through equity
or debt financing in sufficient amounts or to further reduce its operating expenses in a manner to avoid the need to curtail its future
operations subsequent to September 30, 2024. The direct impact of these conditions is not fully known. 

However,
there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that if such funds were available on
commercially reasonable terms or in the necessary amounts, and whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to the Company. In
such case, the reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for the Company to generate positive cash flow to
sustain the operations of the Company. (See Note 12 regarding subsequent events).

The
assumptions used in determining fair value represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if factors change, including changes in the market value of the Company s
common stock, managements assessment, or significant fluctuations in the volatility of the trading market for the Company s
common stock, the Company s fair value estimates could be materially different in the future. 

The
Company computes the fair value of the derivative liability at each reporting period and the change in the fair value is recorded as
non-cash expense or non-cash income. The key component in the value of the derivative liability is the Company s stock price, which
is subject to significant fluctuation and is not under its control, and the assessment of volatility. The resulting effect on net loss
is therefore subject to significant fluctuation and will continue to be so until the Company s variable convertible notes, which
the convertible feature is associated with, are converted into common stock or paid in full with cash. Assuming all other fair value
inputs remain constant, the Company will record non-cash expense when its stock price increases and non-cash income when its stock price
decreases.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview
of Our Company 

The
Company was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Wyoming on September 26, 2013. We are based in San Diego, California. We
are a residential land development company with target properties located primarily in the Baja California Norte region of Mexico and
Southern California. Our principal activities are purchasing properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements required to subdivide
the properties into residential and commercial building plots, securing financing for the purchase of the plots, improving the properties 
infrastructure and amenities, and selling the lots to homebuyers, retirees, investors, and commercial developers. We offer the option
of financing (i.e. taking a promissory note from the buyer for all or part of the purchase price) with a guaranteed acceptance on any
purchase for every customer. 

Overview 

The
real estate market in Northern Baja California has continued to significantly improve and has fully recover from the negative impact
of Covid-19. The housing prices has continued to rise in the Southwest U.S., and inventory has remained severely low, which generated
additional attraction from home buyers seeking second homes or vacation homes. 

The
Company s current portfolio includes residential, resort and commercial properties comprising the following projects: 

Oasis
 Park Resort is a 497-acres master planned real estate community including 1,344 residential
 home sites, south of San Felipe, Baja California, which offers a 180-degree sea and mountain
 views. In addition to the residential lots, there is a planned boutique hotel, a spacious
 commercial center, and a nautical center. 
 
 The
 Company recently allowed prospective homeowners and existing lot holders to tour the property again. 75 of the 1,344 planned residential
 lots were pre-sold to initial shareholders. The Company has made significant progress on the project, which included the completion
 of the two-mile access road and the community entrance structure. The Company also started construction of the waterfront clubhouse,
 and model homes. 

Valle
 Divino is a self-contained solar 650-home site project in Ensenada, Baja California, with test vineyard at the property.
 This resort includes 137 residential lots and 3 commercial lots on 20 acres of land. This represents an estimated 60 million in
 gross sales opportunity. 

Plaza
 Bajamar Resort is an 80-unit project located at the internationally renowned Bajamar Ocean front hotel and golf resort. The
 Bajamar oceanfront golf resort is a master planned golf community located 45 minutes south of the San Diego-Tijuana border along
 the scenic toll road to Ensenada. The first Phase will include 22 Merlot 1,150 square-foot single-family homes that
 features two bedrooms and two baths. The home includes two primary bedroom suites - one on the first floor and one upstairs, as well
 as fairway and ocean views from a rooftop terrace. The Merlot villas will come with the installation of solar packages. 

Emerald
 Grove Estates is the Company s newly renovated Southern California property, used for organized events at this 8,000
 square foot event venue. 

Rancho
 Costa Verde RCVD is a 1,100-acre master planned second home, retirement home and vacation home real estate
 community located on the east coast of Baja California. RCVD is a self-sustained solar powered green community that takes advantage
 of the advances in solar and other green technology. In May 2021, the Company acquired a 25 investment in RCVD in exchange for 100,000
 and 3,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and such investment was initially recorded as an equity-method investment
 in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. On January 3, 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 75 membership
 interest in RCVD for a contractual consideration of 13.5 million, paid through 8,900,000 secured convertible note, 20,000,000 shares
 of common stock and 33,000,000 common stock warrants. Such transaction was recorded pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations .

Summary
of key operational and financial events: 

During
 the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company collected an aggregate amount of 312,175 from house construction at the Plaza Bajamar
 project, which was initially recorded and presented as contract liability in the consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company
 offset the balance with the additional cash funded for the construction of amenities at Bajamar, with the net balance presented as
 impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations in the previous period. 

Continued
 our research and marketing efforts to identify potential home buyers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Through the
 formation of a partnership with a similar development company in the Baja California Norte Region of Mexico, we have been able to
 leverage additional resources with the use of their established and proven marketing plan which can help us with sophisticated execution
 and the desired results for residential plot sales and development. 

Title
 of Oasis Park Resort in San Felipe was assumed during 2019. We are expecting the transfer of title on Valle Divino in Ensenada, Baja
 California and Plaza Bajamar in Ensenada, Baja California before the end of our fiscal year 2024, as we continue to follow the necessary
 steps to complete this legal process.

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses decreased by 383,327 to 635,703 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,019,030 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023.

September 30, 2023. 

Such
decrease mainly relates to the reduced marketing efforts incurred by RCVD and ILAL during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, as the Company was in process of raising additional capital. Sales costs are related to real estate s sales commissions.
Marketing costs include advertising, prospective customers education, travel, and accommodation. In addition, general and administrative
decreased for professional fees and other general and administrative expenses due to the lack of capital available during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024. General and administrative costs mainly include commissions paid attributable to sales. 

Other
expense 

Other
expenses decreased to 528,376 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5,382,787 in the three months ended September 30,
2023. Such change is primarily due to the change in fair value of the Company s derivative
liability, a decrease in loss on debt from extinguishment, a decrease in the loss on acquisition, with interest expense decreasing period
over period. 

Other
expenses decreased to 974,561 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6,548,810 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
 Such change is primarily due to the change in fair value of the Company s derivative liability,
a decrease in loss on debt from extinguishment, a decrease in the loss on acquisition, with interest expense decreasing period over period. 

Net
Income (Loss) 

The
Company finished the three months ended September 30, 2024, with net loss of 251,598, as compared to a net loss of 6,340,368 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in our net loss resulted from the reasons outlined above. 

The
Company finished the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with net income of 3,492,250, as compared to a net loss of 8,627,589 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our net income resulted from the reasons outlined above. 

The
factors that will most significantly affect future operating results will be: 

The
 positive effect of implemented sales and marketing initiatives to drive opportunities into our various projects. 

The
 quality of our amenities. 

The
 global economy and the demand for vacation homes. 

The
 sale price of future plots and home construction compared to the sale price in other resorts in Mexico. 

The
 prime location of our projects. 

Other
than the foregoing we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material
impact on our revenues or expenses. 

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Cash
was 3,339 and 140,247 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. As shown in the accompanying financial statements,
we recorded income of 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our working capital deficit as of September 30, 2024,
was 13.8 million. These factors and our ability to raise additional capital to accomplish our objectives, raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result
of increased operations, increased construction activity and the development of current and future projects which include our current
business operations. 

31 

We
anticipate generating increased revenues over the next twelve months, as we continue to market the sale of plots held for sale at our
various projects, generate cash from the sale of house construction at our properties. 

If
the Company is not successful with its marketing efforts to increase sales, the Company will continue to experience a shortfall in cash,
and it will be necessary to obtain funds through equity or debt financing in sufficient amounts or to further reduce its operating expenses
in a manner to avoid the need to curtail its future operations. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 , was 741,721 which resulted primarily due to net income of 3,492,250, non-cash
share-based compensation of 515,537 , depreciation of 87,250 ,

Item

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and the Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, the Company recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

The
Company conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as defined
in Rule 13a -15(e) and Rule 15d -15(e) under the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses
in internal control over financial reporting related to the lack of adequate accounting and finance personnel, inadequate controls over
maintenance of records, inadequate internal controls relating to the authorization, recognition, capture, and review of transactions,
facts, circumstances, and events that could have a material impact on the Company s financial reporting process.as further discussed
