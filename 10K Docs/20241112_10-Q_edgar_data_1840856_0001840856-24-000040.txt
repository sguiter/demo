 million in cash paid and in shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. The Company has also withheld purchase consideration of million in cash and shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, subject to customary net working capital adjustments, to partially secure the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders under the merger agreement and agreed to pay up to million in cash and in shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock to certain former stockholders of SYNQ3 based upon the achievement of specified future milestones. On the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Company also issued restricted shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions. The fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was million. 
 
 Holdback 
 The million in cash and shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock is being withheld for a period of months (the "Holdback Amount"). The Company determined that there are two components to the Holdback Amount related to deferred consideration and contingent consideration, each comprised of cash and shares. 
 The deferred cash holdback consideration of million and the deferred share holdback consideration of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (collectively the "Deferred Consideration") were not recognized as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date as such amounts were offset by the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders. 
 The contingent cash and share holdback consideration to be issued is variable ("Contingent Holdback Consideration"). Final amounts to be issued will be reduced based upon future actions and settlements with third parties to resolve assumed contingent sales tax liabilities and certain other assumed contingent liabilities of SYNQ3 in connection with the SYNQ3 Acquisition. The Company accounted for the Contingent Holdback Consideration as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent Holdback Consideration was estimated to be million in aggregate and to be settled in million cash and the remainder in shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock and paid an immaterial amount in cash from the Contingent Holdback Consideration to SYNQ3's former stockholders as a result of the net working capital adjustments settled during the quarter. The Contingent Holdback Consideration will be subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense on the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of shares associated with the holdback. 
 
 Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration 
 
 The Company also agreed to pay in aggregate up to million in cash and in shares of Class A Common Stock to certain stockholders of SYNQ3 based on tiered annual revenue targets for each fiscal year 2024, 2025 and 2026 (the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration ). The Company accounted for the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration as a liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration was estimated to be million in aggregate and to be settled in million cash and the remainder in shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. See Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration. 
 
 Restricted stock awards 
 
 The restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock issued at the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date to certain continuing employees of SYNQ3 subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions was determined to be a separate transaction from the SYNQ3 Acquisition and therefore is excluded from purchase consideration. See Note 13 to

 Goodwill recognized includes synergies expected to be achieved from the operations of the combined company and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Expected synergies include both increased revenue opportunities and the cost savings from the planned integration of platform infrastructure, facilities, personnel, and systems. The transaction is considered a non-taxable business combination, and goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments to decrease the deferred revenue by million as the revenue recognition criteria had been met at the acquisition date, to increase the accrued liabilities by million resulting from a pre-acquisition legal contingency, and to decrease the deferred tax liability assumed by million. Refer to Note 7 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the loss contingencies. These measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease of million in deferred cash consideration, million in deferred equity consideration, and million in contingent holdback consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company recorded an increase of million to the goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. There was measurement period adjustment recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 The total preliminary purchase consideration includes shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock issued to the selling shareholders. The Company also issued and deposited shares of Class A Common Stock otherwise owed to the selling shareholders into an escrow account in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders to the Company under the purchase agreement (the Escrow Consideration ). The fair value of equity issued as part of the consideration paid was determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Company s shares on the Amelia Acquisition Date, which also incorporated a discount for lack of marketability rates caused by the trading restrictions due to the fact that the shares were not registered at issuance. for a six-month holding period. The Company also paid million of cash for seller transaction expenses in connection with the closing of the Amelia Acquisition. The Company agreed to issue up to shares to the selling shareholders based on achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 (the "Amelia Contingent Earnout Consideration).

 The Company has determined that the hosted services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services, since each day of providing access to hosted services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided. These services are provided either on a usage basis (i.e., variable consideration) or on a fixed fee subscription basis. The Company recognizes revenue as each distinct service period is performed. 
 Hosted services may include up-front services to develop and/or customize the applications to each customer s specification. Judgement is required to determine whether these professional services are distinct from the hosted services. In making this determination, factors such as the degree of integration, the customers ability to start using the software prior to customization, and the availability of these services from other independent vendors are considered. 
 In instances where the Company concluded that the up-front services are not distinct performance obligations, revenues for these activities are recognized over the period which the hosted services are provided and is included within hosted services revenue. 
 All revenues derived as a result of the SYNQ3 Acquisition, and substantial revenues derived as a result of the Amelia Acquisition are categorized as hosted services revenue. 
 Professional Services 
 Revenues from distinct professional services, such as non-integrated development services and Managed Services, are either recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project or at a point in time at project completion. The Company assesses distinct professional services to determine whether the transfer of control is over-time or at a point in time. The Company considers three criteria in making their assessment including (1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits; (2) the Company s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or (3) the Company s performance does not create an asset with an

 million and million, respectively, of professional service revenue was recognized over time. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was immaterial professional service revenue recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation was fulfilled and control of the service was transferred to the customer. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, million and million, respectively, of professional service revenue was recognized over time. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was and million, respectively, of professional service revenue recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation was fulfilled and control of the service was transferred to the customer. 
 Monetization 
 Monetization revenues are primarily derived from advertising payments associated with ad impressions placed on the SoundHound music identification application. The amount of revenue is based on actual monetization generated or usage, which represent a variable consideration with constrained estimates. Therefore, the Company recognizes the related revenues at a point in time when advertisements are placed, when commissions are paid or when the SoundHound application is downloaded. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in the transaction. The Company has determined that it does not act as the principal in monetization arrangements because it does not control the transfer of the service and it does not set the price. Based on these factors, the Company reports revenue on a net basis. 
 Licensing 
 The Company licenses voice and Amelia s software solutions that are embedded in customer s products or services. Licensing revenues are a distinct performance obligation that is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is at a point in time for non-customized solutions. For licenses with non-distinct customized solutions, revenues are recognized over time based on the progress towards completion of the customized solution. Revenues generated from licensing are on royalty arrangements with a per unit pricing or on fixed considerations. The Company records licensing revenue relating to usage-based royalty arrangements in the same period in which the underlying usage occurs. Licensing revenue on fixed considerations including fixed fee and minimum guarantee from royalty arrangements are recognized when the Company grants the customer the right to use and benefit from the license at the start of the licensing period. Licenses may include post-contract support, which is a distinct performance obligation and revenue from post-contract support is recognized ratably over the licensing period. Revenue from post-contract support was not significant for the periods presented. 
 When a contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative estimated standalone selling price SSP ). Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is determined by maximizing observable inputs from pricing of standalone sales, when possible. Since prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, in instances where the SSP is not directly observable, the Company estimates SSP by considering the following factors: 
 Costs of developing and supplying each performance obligation; 
 Industry standards; 
 Major product groupings; and 
 Gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists.

 The Company also disaggregates revenue by service type. This disaggregation consists of Product Royalties, Service Subscriptions and Monetization. Product Royalties revenues are derived from Houndified Products, which are voice-enabled tangible products across the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Revenues from Product Royalties are based on volume, usage or life of the products, which are driven by number of devices, users or unit of time. Service Subscription revenues are generated through Houndified Services and Amelia services, which include customer services, food ordering, content, appointments and voice commerce, autonomous business workflows, and IT systems analysis. Subscription revenues are derived from monthly fees based on fixed fee, usage-based revenue, revenue per query or revenue per user. Houndified Products, Houndified Services, and Amelia services may include professional services that develop and customize the Houndify platform and Amelia Software Platforms to fit customers specific needs, and any post-contract support for on-premise solutions.

This amount does not include contracts to which the customer is not committed, contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue equal to the amount the Company has the right to invoice for services performed or future sales-based or usage-based royalty payments in exchange for access to the Company s hosted services. This amount is subject to change due to future revaluations of variable consideration, terminations, other contract modifications or currency adjustments.

 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the SYNQ3 Acquisition, SYNQ3 filed a litigation against its landlord, TEBO in the United States District Court of Colorado, and TEBO counterclaimed in May 2022. On June 2, 2022, the District Court entered a judgment that was in favor of SYNQ3. TEBO filed the notice of appeal in July, 2023. On June 27, 2024, the Colorado Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the District Court to enter judgment in favor of TEBO on both SYNQ3 s claim and TEBO s counterclaim and to conduct further proceedings as are necessary to determine the damages, attorney fees and costs, if any, to be awarded to TEBO. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company estimated and recorded a liability of million under accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other Matters 
 The Company continues to analyze potential sales tax exposure using a state-by-state assessment. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company estimated and recorded a liability of million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023.

The Term Loan Warrants have a per share exercise price of and may be exercised, including on a cashless basis, by the holder at any time prior to the anniversary of the issue date. The Term Loan Warrants will be automatically cashless exercised immediately prior to a change in control of the Company. The Term Loan Warrants are indexed to the Company's stock and were classified as an equity instrument. On the Term Loan Closing Date, this resulted in the Company allocating the gross proceeds and issuance costs between the Term Loan and the Term Loan Warrants based on their relative fair values, resulting in the initial recognition of the Term Loan Warrant at million as additional paid-in-capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 In March 2024, the Company issued shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock resulting from the cashless exercise in full of the Term Loan Warrants that were outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, all of the Term Loan Warrants had been exercised and Term Loan Warrants are outstanding.

The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants, for per warrant, upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption, if the reported last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock dividends, sub-divisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period commencing after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. Upon issuance of a redemption notice by the Company, the warrant holders may, at any time after the redemption notice, exercise the Public Warrants for cash, or on a cashless basis. 
 Subsequent to the closing of the ATSP Merger, the Company s Public Warrants continue to be classified as equity instruments, as they are indexed to the Company s stock. 
 Private Warrants 
 Prior to the ATSP Merger, ATSP issued private warrants ("Private Warrants"). The Private Warrants were initially issued in the same form as the Public Warrants with the exception that the Private Warrants: (i) would not be redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by holders other than the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
 The Private Warrants were initially classified as derivative liability instruments as they met the definition of a derivative and were not considered indexed in the Company s own stock as the settlement value could be dependent on who held the Private Warrants at the time of exercise. Upon the Closing of the ATSP Merger, the Company modified its Private Warrants to be identical to its Public Warrants. Therefore, the Private Warrants met requirements for classification as equity instruments, as they are indexed to the Company s stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were Public Warrants and Private Warrants issued and outstanding. There have been exercises during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of SoundHound should be read together with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for 2023 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024 ("Form 10-K" or the "Annual Report). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to SoundHound s plans and strategy for its business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements section of this report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this section to SoundHound, we, us, our and other similar terms refer to SoundHound AI, Inc. 
 
 Company Overview 
 We are a global leader in conversational intelligence, offering independent Voice AI solutions that enable businesses to deliver high-quality conversational experiences to their customers. Built on proprietary technology, SoundHound s voice AI delivers best-in-class speed and accuracy in numerous languages to product creators across automotive, TV, and IoT, and to customer service industries via groundbreaking AI-driven products like Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, and Dynamic Interaction , a real-time, multimodal customer service interface. Along with SoundHound Chat AI, a powerful voice assistant with integrated Generative AI, SoundHound powers millions of products and services, and processes billions of interactions each year for world class businesses. 
 We believe voice-enabled conversational user interface is a more natural interface for nearly all use cases, and product creators should have the ability to design, customize, differentiate, innovate and monetize the interface to their own product, as opposed to outsourcing it to a third-party assistant. For example, using SoundHound, businesses can voice-enable their products so consumers can say things like, Turn off the air conditioning and lower the windows, while in their cars, Find romantic comedies released in the last year, while streaming on their TV and even place food orders before arriving at a restaurant by talking to their cars, TVs or other IoT devices. Additionally, SoundHound s technology can address complex user queries such as, Show me all restaurants within half a mile of the Space Needle that are open past 9pm on Wednesdays and have outdoor seating, and follow-on qualifications such as Okay, don t show me anything with less than 3 stars or fast food. 
 The SoundHound developer platform, Houndify, is an open-access platform that allows developers to leverage SoundHound s Voice AI technology and a library of over 100 content domains, including commonly used domains for points of interest, weather, flight status, sports and more. SoundHound's Collective AI is an architecture for connecting domain knowledge that encourages collaboration and contribution among developers. The architecture is based on proprietary software engineering technology, CaiLAN (Conversational AI Language), and machine learning technology, CaiNET (Conversational AI Network) to ensure fast, accurate and appropriate responses. 
 Our market position is strengthened by the technical barriers to entry in the Voice AI space, which tend to discourage new market participants. Furthermore, our technology is backed by significant investments in intellectual property, with over 155 patents granted and over 115 patents pending, spanning multiple fields including speech recognition, natural language understanding, machine learning, monetization and more. We have achieved this critical momentum in part thanks to a long-tenured leadership team with deep expertise and proven ability to attract and retain talent. We believe that SoundHound has extensive technical expertise and a proven track record of innovation and value creation for us to continue to attract customers in the growing market for Voice AI transactions. 
 We believe that SoundHound is well-positioned to fill the growing void and demand for an independent Voice AI platform. The Voice AI offerings from big tech companies are primarily an extension of their more core services and offerings. Rather than strengthening a customer s product, it can take over the entire experience, thus disintermediating our brand, users and data. As a result, brands relying on big tech may lose their ability to innovate, differentiate and customize. In some cases, these providers even compete with the products they support, making them increasingly less attractive as a choice for a voice interface. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 The alternative options are generally legacy vendors tending to use what we consider to be dated technologies at a high price. Furthermore, many of these technologies still require significant effort by the product creators to turn them into solutions that can compete with the quality of the big tech offering, which in many cases is not practical. Due to the high barrier to entry in Voice AI, there are not many independent players. 
 This creates a great opportunity for SoundHound: we believe that we provide disruptive technologies that are superior to the alternatives, with better terms, allowing customers to maintain their brand, control the user experience, get access to the data and define their own privacy policies, while being able to customize, differentiate, innovate and monetize. 
 When it comes to criteria for adoption, our goal is to win on every dimension. We believe that the first two criteria customers typically consider are technology and brand control. We strive to provide our customers with the best technology, and we provide a white label solution giving our customers control of their brands. In some industries you may have to choose between technology and brand control. In our case, we offer our customers the best of both, enabling them to offer disruptive technologies to their users while maintaining control of their brand and user experience. 
 We also expect to provide an additional path to monetization for our customer base. By choosing our platform, product creators can generate additional revenue while making their product better by using Voice AI, providing further incentive to choose our platform. 
 We believe that we offer a superior ecosystem, benefiting from our Collective AI product architecture along with offering customers definable privacy controls, which are becoming increasingly important in the industry of Voice AI. Additionally, there is no conflict of interest between us and our partners and customers as we do not compete with them (as some other Voice AI vendors do). We also offer edge and hybrid solutions. This means our technology can optionally run without a cloud connection for increased flexibility and privacy. We aim to deliver the most advanced Voice AI in the world and thus allowing our partners to differentiate and innovate their overall experiences for their brands. 
 We strongly believe that product creators know their product and users best. The idea of a single third-party assistant taking over their product is not reflective of our anticipated future. We envision that every product will have its own identity, and will have Voice AI customized in different ways. Product creators can each tap into a single Collective AI to access the ever-growing set of domains, but the product creators can innovate on top of Collective AI and create value for the end users in their own way. This is the future that we are focusing on enabling. 
 When a product is voice enabled, we see three stages of integration and value propositions. The first stage is to enable the core use case of the product. For example, the product could be a TV, a coffee machine, a car, a wearable device, a robot, a smart speaker, an appliance or other devices, and with your voice you can control the functionality of the device and the product. With a TV, you can ask it to change the channel, increase the volume, rewind by 30 seconds, search for movies and even add personalization by adding a TV show to your favorites. Note that this is different from adding a third-party voice assistant to the product. Our view is that every product needs to have an interface, and voice-AI is a natural and compelling interface that unlocks new use cases and potential. Consider just the simple example of rewinding or fast forwarding by a specific duration. That is a command that can be done with voice in only few seconds, but it can take many steps to use alternative interfaces such as a remote control or a companion app. 
 Once the core features of a product are voice-enabled, it can be further enhanced in the second stage of integration: the addition of third-party content and domains. SoundHound has extensive partnerships with content providers and, through these partnerships, can fulfill many needs of our customers. For example, your TV, car or even a coffee machine can answer questions about weather, sports scores, stock prices or flight status, and even search for a local business. The addition of these public domains further enhances the value proposition of the product. 
 Finally, as the third step, you enter the world of monetization where you can add features that deliver value to the end user, and also generate revenues that we share with the product creators. To summarize with an example, imagine walking up to your coffee machine and asking for a triple shot extra hot latte. While you are waiting for your drink, you can ask for weather and sports scores, and if you desire, you can even order bagels from your favorite nearby bakery. 
 There are three pillars to our revenue model. The first pillar is Product Royalties, where we voice enable a product and the product creator pays us a royalty based on volume, usage or duration. SoundHound collects royalty revenue when our technology is placed in a car, smart speaker or an appliance, for example. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 The second pillar is Service Subscription. This is when, for example, SoundHound enables customer service or food ordering for restaurants or content management, appointments and voice commerce. And, for that, we generate subscription revenue from the service providers. Pillars one and two can grow independently and they are proven, established business models. 
 The third pillar seeks to create a monetization ecosystem that brings the services from pillar two to the products in pillar one. When the users of a voice-enabled product in pillar one access the voice-enabled services of pillar two, these services generate new leads and transactions. SoundHound will generate monetization revenue from the services for generating these leads and transactions, and we will share the revenue with the product creators of pillar one. 
 For example, when the driver of a voice-enabled car places an order to a restaurant that is also voice enabled, we will have unlocked a seamless transaction. Accordingly, the restaurant will pay us for that order, and we will share that revenue with the product creator or the car manufacturer. In this example, each party receives value in the ecosystem. The restaurant is happy because they generated a new lead and booked a sale. The user is happy because they have received value through a natural ordering process, simply by speaking to their car. And the car manufacturer is happy because they delivered value to the end user and generated additional revenue from the usage of their product. 
 During the periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not generated revenue from leads and transactions on voice-enabled products from voice-enabled services other than from the SoundHound music identification app. Going forward, SoundHound expects monetization revenue to be generated through a combination of advertising revenue from the music identification app and, over time, from leads and transactions on voice-enabled products from voice-enabled services, which we expect will provide much more seamless opportunities for consumers to access goods and services that they covet as we further build out and scale the voice-enabled ecosystem. 
 We expect this disruptive, three-pillar business model will create a monetization flywheel; as more products integrate into our platform, more users will use it and more services will choose to integrate as well. This creates even more usage, and results in a flow of revenue share to product creators, which further encourages even greater adoption and integration with our platform and the cycle will perpetually continue and expand. This ecosystem increases adoption and increases our addressable market. While all three pillars contribute to our revenues today, the majority of the contribution is currently from our first pillar with only a small contribution from pillar three from our music identification app. Over time, the subscription and monetization portions are expected to grow and make a bigger contribution to our overall revenue. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Amelia Acquisition 
 On August 6, 2024, we completed its acquisition of Amelia, a privately-held conversational AI software company involved in the development and delivery of AI and automation solutions and related services to improve customer experience and optimize business outcomes. We expect Amelia will bring together decades of experience in conversational AI, and highly complementary product portfolios, to offer best-in-class, scalable customer service support to a vast spectrum of businesses. These include some of the very largest multinational enterprise brands, top 15 global banks, and Fortune 500 organizations, with the combined company spanning nearly 200 marquee customers. We believe the acquisition of Amelia is expected to strengthen SoundHound s position in voice and conversational AI and allow the Company to enter new industries such as healthcare, insurance, financial services, and retail, expanding its market reach. 
 We have incurred certain significant costs relating to the SYNQ3 and Amelia Acquisitions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and other professional services fees, as well as other customary payments. Refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for a discussion regarding the risks associated with the acquisitions. 
 
 Known Trends, Demands, Commitments, Events or Uncertainties Impacting Our Business 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on many factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including the following: 
 Investments in Technology. Our business model since inception has been to invest in our technology in the form of dedicated research and development. We will continue to invest in the development of our software platform to deliver consumers with continually improving value and delight. Our investments include continuous enhancements to our technology we've developed over the last two decades or acquired from acquisitions, 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 investments in data to help refine and improve our underlying algorithms and other costs to attract and retain a world-class technical workforce. 
 Revenue Growth. Our commercial success, including acceptance and use of our applications, will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as size of the market opportunity, successful integration with original equipment manufacturers OEM ), competition and demand from the public and members of the conversational AI community. Our product offerings, including those offerings that we have acquired, have disruptive effects in the ways human interact with computers and we are developing new, innovative economic models and acquiring companies such as SYNQ3 and Amelia which have synergistic businesses to ours that we believe will enhance value to customers, partners and shareholders. For our revenue growth to continue, we will need to invest in sales and marketing to ensure our messaging, capabilities and offerings are well understood and valued by customers. With our primary focus on enterprise customers, we also need to align with enterprise sales cycles, which can be longer than consumer cycles. As we build new customer relationships, we continually focus on maintaining and growing our existing relationships through long-term partnerships through significant upfront investment in customer specific engineering projects. Additionally, in addition to our acquisitions of SYNQ3 and Amelia, we may look to acquire other companies in the industry to develop synergies with our existing business. 
 Cost of Revenues. The results of our business will depend in part on our ability to establish and increase our gross margins by scaling our business model and effectively managing our costs to produce our applications. Our revenue will be directly supported by data center investments in technology, both on premise and in the cloud. The associated workloads, along with supporting labor costs, will need to be managed effectively as we scale to improve our margins over time. Our Houndify platform is also powered by a library of over 100 content domains, including commonly used domains for points of interest, weather, flight status, sports and more. 
 Seasonality. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our technology could be negatively affected by many factors, including seasonal demand. We anticipate that we will experience fluctuations in customer and user demand based on seasonality. For example, in the past, we have seen approximately one third of our revenue in the first half of the year with the remaining two thirds in the second half. Additionally, given that we address markets across several different industry verticals, the associated overall seasonality impact to us may not be consistent year-to-year. 
 Development of International Markets. We have rapidly expanded our capabilities and global reach. For example, we have globalized our solution to include 25 languages. We view opportunities for conversational Voice AI to be global in reach, and we expect our growth to be fueled across multiple geographies. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 SoundHound generates revenues through: (1) Product Royalties, meaning royalties from voice-enabled products which are driven by volume, usage or life of applicable products and are affected by number of devices, users and units of usage, (2) Service Subscriptions, meaning subscription revenues, derived from monthly fees based on usage-based revenue, revenue per query or revenue per user, and (3) Monetization, meaning revenues generated from focused ad targeting to users of products and services that employ our technologies. Currently, our monetization revenue is derived only from our music identification application primarily in the form of ad impression revenue revenue generated when an ad is shown in our music identification app and, to a lesser extent, affiliate revenue for referrals to music stores for content sales and downloads of our premium music application. 
 Houndified Products, meaning products of our customers that employ SoundHound technology, and Houndified Services, meaning services provided to customers related to SoundHound technology, provide our customers with access to our Houndify platform over a contractual period without taking possession of the software. This generally includes revenues derived from up-front services professional services that develop and customize the Houndify platform to fit customers specific needs. These professional services are included in both our Product Royalties and Service Subscriptions revenues. Non-distinct professional services are recognized over the contractual life of the contract, whereas revenues from distinct professional services are recognized as the services are performed or when the services are complete depending on the arrangement.

 We have and may continue to experience volatility for our remaining performance obligations and deferred revenue as a result of the timing for completing our performance obligations. We had remaining performance obligations in the amount of 66.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Given the applicable contract terms, 40.9 million is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year, 24.1 million is expected to be recognized between 2 to 5 years and the remainder of 2.0 million is expected to be recognized after 5 years. Deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue being recognized and can fluctuate with changes in billing frequency and other factors. As a result of these factors, as well as our mix of revenue streams and billing frequencies, we do not believe that changes in our remaining performance obligations and deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth in that period. 
 We anticipate that we will experience fluctuations in our revenues from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of factors, including acquisitions, the supply and demand of end user products such as automobiles, the size and success of our sales force and the number of users who are aware of and use our application. See Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information. 
 Operating Expenses 
 We classify our operating expenses into the following seven categories, which are cost of revenues, sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities, amortization of intangible assets and restructuring. With respect to sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative, each expense category includes overhead, including rent and related occupancy costs, which is allocated based on headcount. We plan to continue investing to support our go-to-market strategies and customer engagement, develop our current and future applications and support our operations as a public company. While our gross margin may continue to fluctuate in the near-term due to revenue contributions from varying product mixes, as well as acquisitions, we expect it will stabilize as we continue to scale our business. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 SoundHound s cost of revenues are comprised of direct costs associated directly with SoundHound s revenue streams as described above. This primarily includes costs and depreciation related to hosting for cloud-based services, such as data centers, electricity charges, content fees and certain personnel-related expenses including personnel costs under call centers that are directly related to these revenue streams. Additionally, our cost of revenues also includes the amortization of developed technology acquired from SYNQ3, Amelia and other acquisition as intangible assets. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel-related costs of the sales and marketing team, promotional campaigns, advertising fees and other marketing related costs. Advertising costs are expensed to sales and marketing when incurred. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development expenses are our largest operating expense as we continue to develop our software platforms and produce new technological capabilities. 
 The costs of these activities consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, third-party consultants and costs associated with technological supplies and materials, along with other direct and allocated expenses such as facility costs, depreciation and other shared expenses. We expense research and development costs associated with the design and development of new products in the periods in which they are incurred. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related costs, accounting and legal expenses, third-party consulting costs, insurance and allocated overhead including rent, depreciation and utilities.

Table of Contents 

 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Acquisition Liabilities 
 The change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities is related to contingent consideration from the SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions. The contingent consideration was determined to be liability classified and is remeasured as of each reporting period with a corresponding change in fair value recorded. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of acquired customer relationships, tradename and conversation data is included within operating expenses and arises from the amortization of assets acquired through the acquisitions. We review intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of recoverability is required, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with the asset are compared with the asset s carrying amount. If the estimated future cash flows from the use of the asset are less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. 
 Restructuring 
 Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance payments, employee benefits and share-based compensation related to reduced headcount from our restructuring plan ("Restructuring Plan") announced in January 2023. The Restructuring Plan was complete as of December 31, 2023. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt represents the loss associated with the repayment of the Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement with ACP Post OAK Credit II LLC (the "Term Loan") in June 2024 and the repayment of the 2021 note payable ("SVB March 2021 Note") and 2021 convertible note ("SCI June 2021 Note") in April 2023. See Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of stated interest incurred on our formerly outstanding convertible notes and term debt during the relevant periods, as well as the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs over the life of the instruments or a shorter period if a lender can demand payment in the event certain events occur that are outside of our control. 
 The issuance of debt instruments with direct transaction costs, embedded derivatives and warrant instruments has resulted in debt discounts. Direct transaction costs consist of various transaction fees and third-party costs, such as bank and legal fees, that are incurred upon issuance. We expect the impact of the discounts from debt issuance costs to the interest expense will decrease due to the repayment of Term Loan in June 2024. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists of the change in fair value related to our derivative liability, interest income, gain on bargain purchase and other income (expense). 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense includes federal, state and foreign taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We are in a cumulative loss position for tax purposes based on historical earnings. As of December 31, 2023, we had 395.5 million of U.S. federal and 109.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in 2025 and 2028, respectively, with the exception of 306.8 million federal net operating loss carryforwards and 5.6 million state net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely. 
 We had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of 14.4 million and 10.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The federal credits will expire starting in 2029 if not utilized. The state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had Canadian SR ED tax credits of 1.7 million, which expire starting in 2038 if not utilized.

 We recognized a change in valuation allowance due to taxable temporary differences from the intangible assets acquired from the Amelia Acquisition, resulting in the tax benefit of 11.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state tax laws, utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to annual limitations due to certain ownership changes. Our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire before utilization if subject to annual limitations.

 Total revenues increased by 11.8 million, or 89 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase of 18.5 million in service subscription revenue, primarily based in the Americas, was driven by the contribution of Amelia and SYNQ3 revenue. This is offset by a decrease in product royalties revenue in the Asia region, due to the minimum guarantee licensing revenue relating to the edge solution ("Houndify Edge") recognized in the previous period. 
 Total revenues increased by 21.4 million, or 75 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase of 25.0 million in service subscription revenue, primarily based in the Americas, was driven by the contribution of Amelia and SYNQ3 revenue. This is offset by a decrease in product royalties revenue in the Asia region, due to the minimum guarantee licensing revenue relating to Houndify Edge recognized in the previous period. We also saw an increase of professional service and unit-based Product Royalties, including SoundHound Chat AI, in both the Asia and EMEA region.

Table of Contents 

 Cost of revenues increased by 9.3 million, or 259 , and 15.2 million, or 205 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Gross margin decreased to 49 and 55 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 73 and 74 during the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the acquisitions of Amelia and SYNQ3, which included a mix of lower margin call center agent business from SYNQ3 and amortization of acquired intangible assets. In the past, our gross margin has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to revenue contributions from varying product mixes. However, we expect to gradually improve gross margins in the mid-term, especially as it relates the integration of Amelia and SYNQ3. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 3.9 million, or 87 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in 2024 of 3.2 million in personnel-related costs, 0.5 million in legal and professional fees, 0.2 million in consulting fees, 0.1 million in office expense, and 0.1 million in travel expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease of 0.3 million incurred for information technology and facility allocations. Included in the sales and marketing expense is an increase of 1.7 million arising from the Amelia acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 5.1 million, or 36 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in 2024 of 4.5 million in personnel-related costs, 0.5 million in consulting fees, 0.5 million in legal and professional fees, 0.2 million in office expense, and 0.2 million in travel expense, which were partially offset by a decrease of 0.7 million incurred for information technology and facility allocations. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 6.7 million, or 53 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs of 4.3 million, spending on cloud computing services of 2.7 million, office expense of 0.1 million and consulting fees of 0.1 million. This is partially offset by the reduced information technology and facility allocations of 0.5 million, and legal and professional fees of 0.1 million. Included in the research and development expense is an increase of 1.0 million arising from the Amelia acquisition and 1.1 million arising from the SYNQ3 acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs. 
 Research and development expenses increased by 11.4 million, or 30 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs of 8.2 million, spending on cloud computing services of 5.3 million, 0.2 million in property-related expenses and consulting fees of 0.2 million. This is partially offset by the reduced information technology and facility allocations of 1.8 million, legal and professional fees of 0.4 million, and office expenses of 0.2 million. Included in the research and development expense is an increase of 2.8 million arising from the SYNQ3 acquisition and 1.0 million arising from the Amelia acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 10.1 million, or 146 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of 6.0 million in legal and professional fees, of which 4.8 million relate to the Amelia Acquisition, 2.8 million in personnel-related costs, 0.8 million in information technology and facility allocations, 0.6 million in consulting fees, 0.4 million in office expenses, and 0.2 million in bad debt expense. The SYNQ3 and Amelia Acquisitions led to increases in personnel-related costs, amortization expense and office expenses. This increase was offset by reductions of 0.6 million in equipment rental expense, and 0.2 million in property-related expenses. Included in the general and administrative expense is an increase of 0.7 million arising from the Amelia acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs. 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 16.2 million, or 78 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of 10.7 million in legal and professional fees, of which 4.8 million relate to the Amelia Acquisition and 0.8 million relate to the SYNQ3 Acquisition, 4.4 million in personnel-related costs, 2.5 million in information technology and facility allocations, 0.4 million in bad debt expense, 0.3 million in consulting fees, and 0.1 million in travel

 expense. The SYNQ3 and Amelia Acquisitions led to increases in personnel-related costs, amortization expense and office expenses. This increase was offset by reductions of 0.8 million in insurance expense, 0.7 million in equipment rental cost and 0.5 million in office expense, and 0.3 million in property-related expenses. Included in the general and administrative expense is an increase of 0.7 million arising from the Amelia acquisition, stemming from increased personnel-related costs. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the short term as we invest in our control environment. However, in the long term, we expect general and administrative expenses to grow at a rate below that of our revenue, aligning with our strategic emphasis on cost effectiveness and sustainable financial performance. 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Acquisition Liabilities 
 The change in fair value of acquisition related liabilities, which is driven by the movements in our stock price and changes in the assessed probability of achieving certain future revenue targets, was a gain of 1.4 million and a loss of 1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We will continue to review our estimates on the quarterly basis over the remaining earnout period until 2026. See Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information. 
 Amortization of Intangibles 
 Amortization of acquired developed technology is included within cost of revenues, while the amortization of other intangible assets, including acquired customer relationships, tradename and conversation data, are included within operating expenses. All intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
 The following table summarizes the amortization of intangible assets by operating expense category in thousands):

 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 The 15.6 million increase in loss on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a loss on repayment of Term Loan in June 2024. See Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 4.3 million, or 80 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the early repayment of Term Loan in June, 2024, resulting in the decrease in interest expense, which was partially offset by the increased interest expense of 1.0 million from Amelia Debt in the period. 
 Interest expense decreased by 0.4 million, or 4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the early repayment of Term Loan in June, 2024 and the interest expense from on our SVB March 2021 Note and SCI June 2021 Note in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were terminated at the time that the Term Loan was obtained in April 2023. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the increased interest expense of 1.0 million from Amelia Debt in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect interest expense will decrease as a result of the extinguishment of the Term Loan.

 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by 1.1 million, or 88 , and 4.8 million, or 232 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to interest earned on greater money market and treasury bond balances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as we engaged in significant transactions that increased our liquidity. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of the changes in our business that led to an increase in cash for the period ended September 30, 2024.

 Loss on Change in Fair Value of Equity Line of Credit Program 
 We recorded loss on changes in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with the ELOC (as defined below) of 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. There was no change in fair value of the derivative liability associated with the ELOC for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we sold the entirety of the 25,000,000 shares under the ELOC during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Gain on Bargain Purchase 
 The gain on bargain purchase of 1.2 million was recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a favorable fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from an immaterial acquisition at the date of acquisition as compared with the purchase price. See Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Provision for income taxes (9,558) 2,307 (11,865) (514) 
 Provision for income taxes decreased by 12.1 million , or 772 , and 11.9 million , or 514 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributed to increased tax benefit from acquisitions. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand as of September 30, 2024 was 135.6 million. Alth ough we have incurred recurring losses each year since our inception, we expect we will be able to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and available cash balances. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 Sources of Cash and Material Cash Requirements 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, which are sourced primarily from the sale of marketable securities. The primary uses of cash include the funding of operating expenses, as well as acquisition related costs. There were no material changes to our material cash requirements as disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (our Annual Report ). 
 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 We entered into the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Managers on April 9, 2024 with regards to an at-the-market equity program. Under this program, we may offer and sell aggregate gross sale proceeds up to 150.0 million of shares of our Class A Common Stock from time to time through the Managers. Sales of Class A Common Stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement were made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering

 as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Managers were entitled to commission at a fixed rate of 2.5 of the gross sales price per share for their services in acting as agents in the sale of our Class A Common Stock. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we sold a total of 10,465,581 and 31,694,198 shares of our common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement, at a weighted-average price of 4.74 and 4.73 per share, respectively, and raised 49.6 million and 150.0 million of gross proceeds, respectively. After deducting approximately 1.2 million and 3.7 million, respectively, of commissions and offering costs incurred by us , th e net proceeds from sales of common stock was 48.4 million and 146.2 million, respectively during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had no remaining capacity to sell the common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement. 
 SYNQ3 Acquisition 
 On January 3, 2024 (the "SYNQ3 Acquisition Date"), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of SYNQ3, a leading provider of voice AI and other technology solutions to the restaurant industry, for total preliminary purchase consideration of 15.7 million (the SYNQ3 Acquisition ). 
 
 The total preliminary purchase consideration includes 3.9 million in cash paid and 5,755,910 in shares of our Class A Common Stock issued as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. We also withheld purchase consideration of 0.5 million in cash and 1,179,514 shares of our Class A Common Stock, subject to customary net working capital adjustments, to partially secure the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders under the merger agreement and agreed to pay up to 0.8 million in cash and 1,434,936 in shares of our Class A Common Stock to certain former stockholders of SYNQ3 based upon the achievement of specified future milestones. We also issued 2,033,156 restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions. 
 
 We incurred 1.9 million in acquisition related expenses, of which 0.5 million and 0.8 million were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recorded as general and administration expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 
 Holdback 
 
 The 0.5 million in cash and 1,179,514 shares of our Class A Common Stock is being withheld for a period of 15 months (the Holdback Amount ). We determined that there are two components to the Holdback Amount related to deferred consideration and contingent consideration, each comprised of cash and shares. 
 
 The deferred cash holdback consideration of 0.1 million and the deferred share holdback consideration of 361,145 shares of our Class A Common Stock (collectively, the Deferred Consideration were not recognized as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date as such amounts were offset by the indemnification obligations of SYNQ3's former stockholders. 
 
 The contingent cash and share holdback consideration to be issued is variable Contingent Holdback Consideration ). Final amounts to be issued will be reduced based upon future actions and settlements with third parties to resolve assumed contingent sales tax liabilities and certain other assumed contingent liabilities of SYNQ3 in connection with the SYNQ3 Acquisition. We accounted for the Contingent Holdback Consideration as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent Holdback Consideration was estimated to be 0.4 million in aggregate and to be settled in 0.1 million cash and the remainder in shares of our Class A Common Stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 38,277 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock and paid an immaterial amount in cash from the Contingent Holdback Consideration to SYNQ3's former stockholders as a result of the net working capital adjustments settled during the quarter. The Contingent Holdback Consideration will be subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss of 0.2 million and 0.5 million, respectively, related to the Contingent Holdback Consideration. 
 Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration 
 We also agreed to pay in aggregate up to 0.8 million in cash and 1,434,936 in shares of Class A Common Stock, to certain stockholders of SYNQ3 based on tiered annual revenue targets for each fiscal year 2024, 2025 and 2026 (the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration ). We accounted for the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration as a 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date, the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration was estimated to be 1.7 million in aggregate and to be settled in 0.2 million cash and the remainder in shares of our Class A Common Stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 1.5 million and a loss of 1.2 million, respectively, related to the Contingent SYNQ3 Earnout Consideration, reflected in the change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Restricted stock awards 
 The 2,033,156 restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock issued at the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date to certain continuing employees of SYNQ3 subject to time and performance-based vesting conditions was determined to be a separate transaction from the SYNQ3 Acquisition and therefore is excluded from purchase consideration. 
 Restricted stock units 
 As a condition of the SYNQ3 Acquisition, we additionally granted certain employees awards with future vesting conditions. As a result, we determined that these awards should be accounted for separately from the SYNQ3 Acquisition and therefore are excluded from purchase consideration. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded measurement period adjustments to decrease the deferred revenue by 0.1 million as the revenue recognition criteria had been met at the acquisition date, to increase the accrued litigation liabilities by 1.9 million resulting from a pre-acquisition legal contingency, and to decrease the deferred tax liabilities assumed by 0.2 million. Refer to Note 7 to these condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the loss contingencies. These measurement period adjustments resulted in a decrease of 0.1 million in deferred cash consideration, 0.6 million in deferred equity consideration, and 0.6 million in contingent holdback consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. As a result of the adjusted acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we booked an increase of 0.3 million to the goodwill recognized. The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. 
 
 The preliminary purchase price allocation has not been finalized as of September 30, 2024 primarily due to the final assessment of the fair values of the intangible assets, contingent sales tax liability assumed and fair value of the contingent acquisition liabilities. The fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is pending the completion of various items, including obtaining further information regarding the identification and valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such as the contingent liabilities accrued for a pre-acquisition legal contingency. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information. Any adjustments to the estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined, and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation within 12 months from the SYNQ3 Acquisition Date. 
 
 Amelia Acquisition 
 On August 6, 2024 (the Amelia Acquisition Date ), we completed the acquisition of Amelia Holdings, Inc. (the Amelia Acquisition ), a privately-held conversational AI software company involved in the development and delivery of AI and automation solutions and related services to improve customer experience and optimize business outcomes. 
 
 On the Amelia Acquisition Date, we issued a total of 3,809,520 shares of the SoundHound Class A common stock to the sellers. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we also issued and deposited 2,149,530 shares of the SoundHound Class A common stock into an escrow account in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders under the Purchase Agreement. We also paid 8.4 million of cash for seller transaction expenses in connection with the closing of the Amelia Acquisition. We agreed to issue up to 16,822,429 shares to the selling shareholders based on achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The fair value of the preliminary purchase consideration was 103.9 million. 
 
 In connection with the Amelia Acquisition, we assumed the amended senior secured term loan facility from Amelia in an aggregate principal amount of 121.5 million Amelia Debt ). See Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the Amelia Debt.

Escrow Consideration 
 On the Amelia acquisition Date, we issued and deposited 2,149,530 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock into and escrow account in order to partially secure the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders under the purchase agreement. The Company accounted for the Escrow Consideration as equity issued as part of consideration transferred. Upon the settlement of any valid indemnification claims against the sellers, the escrow agent will return a number of shares to us equal to the dollar value of the indemnified loss divided by the reference price of 5.35 as stipulated in the purchase agreement. We concluded that this variability in settlement value is a derivative that is requirement to be remeasured to fair value due to changes in stock price. This derivative did not have a material impact to the financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon the expiration of the escrow period, any remaining shares in the escrow account will be released to the selling shareholders. 
 
 Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration 
 We agreed to pay up to 16,822,429 in shares of Class A Common Stock to the selling shareholders based on achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 (the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration ). We accounted for the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration as a liability within contingent acquisition liabilities on the our condensed consolidated balance sheet and will subsequently remeasure the liability at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized as a component of operating expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As of the Amelia Acquisition Date, the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration had an estimated fair value of 71.6 million and will be settled in shares of our Class A Common Stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 0.5 million loss related to the Contingent Amelia Earnout Consideration, reflected in the change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included within this report for more information on the fair value measurement of Contingent Amalia Earnout Consideration. 
 The preliminary purchase price allocation has not been finalized as of September 30, 2024 primarily due to the final assessment of the fair values of the intangible assets, contingent tax liability assumed and fair value of the contingent acquisition liabilities. The fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is pending the completion of various items, including obtaining further information regarding the identification and valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to the estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined, and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation within 12 months from the Amelia Acquisition Date. 
 Other Acquisition 
 On June 14, 2024, we completed an immaterial acquisition for total preliminary purchase consideration of 1.0 million. As part of the acquisition, we acquired net assets of 2.2 million, including intangible assets of 2.6 million, and recognized a preliminary gain on bargain purchase of 1.2 million within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from a favorable fair value of identifiable net assets acquired at the date of acquisition as compared with the purchase price. We were able to negotiate a bargain purchase price as a result of the recurring losses and pre-filing bankruptcy status of the selling entity.

 the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation within 12 months from the acquisition date. 
 We incurred 0.1 million in acquisition related expenses, of which zero and 0.1 million were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recorded as general and administration expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Sales Agreement 
 On July 28, 2023, we entered into the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC, and D.A. Davidson Co. (each a Sales Agent and collectively, the Sales Agents ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 150.0 million of shares of our Class A Common Stock from time to time through or to the Sales Agents acting as agent or principal. Sales of our Class A Common Stock, if any, under the Sales Agreement were made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Sales Agents are entitled to aggregate compensation at a fixed commission rate of 2.5 of the gross sales price per share sold under the Sales Agreement. We have agreed to reimburse the Sales Agents for certain specified expenses, including the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of its legal counsel in an amount of 75 thousand in the aggregate in connection with the execution of the Sales Agreement. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we sold a total of 37,907,219 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at a weighted-average price of 3.62 per share and raised 137.3 million of gross proceeds, which resulted in complete utilization of the Sales Agreement as of March 31, 2024. After deducting approximately 3.4 million of commissions and offering costs incurred by us , th e net proceeds from sales of common stock was 133.8 million. 
 Debt Financing 
 On April 14, 2023 (the Term Loan Closing Date ), we entered into a Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with ACP Post Oak Credit II LLC, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders (the Agent ), and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders ). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 100.0 million, the entirety of which was funded on the Term Loan Closing Date. 
 As of June 30, 2024, the interest rate was approximately 14.0 . Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the Credit Agreement, interest on the Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. The Term Loan is set to mature on April 14, 2027 (the Maturity Date ). The Credit Agreement provides for no scheduled principal payments prior to the Maturity Date.

Accordingly, the accrued and unpaid interest of 2.6 million was waived under the Payoff Letter. 
 Amelia Debt 
 In connection with the Amelia Acquisition, we assumed the amended senior secured term loan facility from Amelia in an aggregate principal amount of 121.5 million Amelia Debt and on August 7, 2024, we paid 70.0 million in cash to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal balance and issued 2,943,917 shares of Class A common stock to settle certain fees associated with the Amelia Debt.

 accrued interest due at the Maturity Date. Refer to Note 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Amelia Debt . 
 Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) 
 On August 16, 2022, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and related registration rights agreement (the CFPI Registration Rights Agreement with CF Principal Investments LLC (the Counterparty ). Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, we have the right to sell to the Counterparty up to the lesser of (i) 25,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) the Exchange Cap (as defined in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the "ELOC Shares"). On February 14, 2023, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 registering the resale of the ELOC Shares (the "ELOC Registration Statement") was declared effective. On March 31, 2023, a post-effective amendment to the ELOC Registration Statement was declared effective. We have utilized and expect to continue to utilize proceeds from the ELOC for working capital and other general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold the entirety of the 25,000,000 shares under the ELOC program for aggregate proceeds of approximately 71.7 million. 
 Series A Preferred Stock 
 On or around January 20, 2023, we entered into Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements with certain investors (the "Investors"), pursuant to which we issued and sold to the Investors an aggregate of 835,011 shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate issue price of approximately 25.0 million. 
 Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into such number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the liquidation preference per share ("Liquidation Preference") at the time of conversion divided by 1.00 (the Conversion Price ). In addition, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock at the Conversion Price on or after January 20, 2024 if and when the daily volume-weighted average closing price per share of Class A Common Stock is at least 2.5 times the Conversion Price for each of any 90 trading days during any 120 consecutive trading day period, which 120-trading day period may commence (but may not end) prior to January 20, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 475,005 shares of preferred stock were converted into 16,624,215 shares of Class A Common Stock. The conversion was pursuant to the original terms of the agreement and therefore the carrying value of Series A Preferred Stock was converted into Class A Common Stock with no gain or loss upon conversion. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all the Series A Preferred Stock have been converted to Class A Common Stock. 
 The holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to cumulative dividends payable for such share at the rate of 14 per annum, compounding semi-annually to Liquidation Preference on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Total cumulative dividends attributable to Series A Preferred Stock for the the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were zero and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 Contractual and Other Obligations 
 Because we expect to continue investing in software application and development, we enter into various contracts and agreements to increase our availability of capital. Cash that is received through these obligations is used to meet both short and long-term liquidity requirements as discussed above. These requirements generally include funding for the research and development of software, the development of applications that enable voice interaction, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. The primary types of obligations into which we enter include contractual obligations, operating and finance lease obligations and a diversified spread of debt instruments. Refer to Note 7 and Note 9 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (75,755) (54,395) Net cash used in investing activities (12,292) (334) Net cash provided by financing activities 115,445 155,175 Effects of exchange rate changes on cash (16) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents 27,382 100,446 
 Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 75.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 54.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 21.4 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our increased net loss of 21.1 million, an increase in deferred income taxes of 11.5 million resulting from the tax benefit from acquisitions, a net decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of 10.3 million, a decrease in amortization of debt issuance cost of 2.0 million, a decrease in loss on change in fair value of ELOC program of 1.9 million, and a decrease in non-cash lease amortization of 0.2 million, an increase in foreign currency gain from remeasurement of 0.1 million, and a net increase in other non-cash loss of 0.4 million. This was partially offset by an increase of 14.8 million in loss on early extinguishment of debt, 6.2 million in depreciation and amortization, 2.7 million in stock-based compensation, and 1.7 million in change in the fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities. 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 12.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 12.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the payments related to acquisitions of 11.7 million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of 0.2 million. 
 Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 115.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 155.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 39.7 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the 175.6 million of the repayment of Term Loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 35.0 million of the repayment of SVB March 2021 Note and the SCI June 2021 Note during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by 287.3 million in net proceeds from sales of Class A Common Stock under the Sales Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 71.5 million in net proceeds from sales of Class A Common Stock under the ELOC program during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we experienced a decrease of 24.9 million in net proceeds from the one-time issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, 85.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Term Loan, and an increase of 7.2 million in the payment of financing costs associated with the Sales Agreement, an increase of 2.2 million in proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 We enter into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, we indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to its technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements is not determinable. Additionally, we have, and may in the future, indemnify third parties in connection with our issuance of securities (including pursuant to our at-the-market offering program) and in connection with acquisitions of other companies. Our liability is generally limited to the aggregate amount of consideration actually received in these instances. We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, we believe the fair value of these agreements is minimal. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported income (loss) generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024. We have identified and disclosed new significant accounting policies related to the current period that we determined were critical accounting policies below. 
 Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration 
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but the estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. 
 Certain business combinations include contingent consideration arrangements, which are generally based on achievement of future financial performance or future events. If it is determined the contingent consideration arrangement is not compensatory, we estimate fair value of contingent consideration payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. We review and assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration each reporting period, and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. Adjustments to estimated fair value related to changes in fair value are reported as change in fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment or when indicators of impairment are present. The test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. If indicators are present, a quantitative test of impairment is performed. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our policy is to review 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st unless a triggering event requires an analysis sooner. There was no goodwill impairment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Intangible Assets with Definite Lives 
 Our intangible assets consist principally of developed technology, customer relationships, tradename, and conversation data. We assess the appropriate method of amortization of the intangible assets that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. We determined that a straight-line method of amortization was appropriate for its intangible assets. The remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are re-assessed periodically at the asset group level for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset or asset group. 
 Intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset group s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group. There were no intangible asset impairments in any of the periods presented. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes in market risks from the information presented in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Form 10-K, except as disclosed below. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure to interest rate risk, primarily in the form of variable-rate borrowings. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had total borrowings of 39.7 million outstanding with an interest rate of 14.47 . With all other variables remaining constant, an increase in the short-term interest rate of 1 percent would result in an increase in the annual interest expense of approximately 0.4 million . Refer to Note 9: Note Payable for additional information related to the Company s debt. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Ou r condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is also the functional currency for our foreign operations. Where transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies, we are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded the exchange rate losses of approximately 0.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded exchange rate losses of approximately 0.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively. We do not believe that an immediate 10 increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on operating results. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, which were previously identified and reported in our 2023 Form 10-K as part of Management's report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting for the year ended December 31, 2023. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our condensed financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the condensed financial statements included in the Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 In accordance with the Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations issued by SEC staff, companies are allowed to exclude acquired businesses from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year after completion of an acquisition and from the assessment of disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed in the internal control over financial reporting. Based on this guidance, our assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 excluded the portion of disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting of acquired entities. The Company completed the acquisition of SYNQ3 on January 3, 2024. SYNQ3 s total assets represented approximately 5 of the Company's consolidated total assets, excluding the effects of purchase accounting, and its revenues represented approximately 11 and 18 , respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company completed the acquisition of Amelia on August 6, 2024. Amelia s total assets represented approximately 26 of the Company's consolidated total assets, excluding the effects of purchase accounting, and its revenues represented approximately 62 and 31 , respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company completed an immaterial acquisition on June 14, 2024. Total assets, excluding the effects of purchase accounting, and revenue from the acquired entity were not material to the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 As reported in Part II, Item 9A. "Controls and Procedures" of our Form 10-K, we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the control environment as the Company lacked sufficient oversight of activities related to its internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of appropriate level of experience and training commensurate with its financial reporting requirements; risk assessment as changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting; the accounting for complex financing transactions, segregation of duties, and certain information technology (IT) general controls related to user access controls, program change management controls and computer operations controls over information systems relevant to the preparation of the preparation of our financial statements. The material weaknesses related to the control environment, risk assessment and complex financing transactions resulted in the revision of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023. The material weaknesses related to segregation of duties and IT general controls did not result in a misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the material weaknesses could result in misstatements to substantially all of our accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Management's Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 
 The following remediation actions are currently being implemented and are in progress: 
 Engaged a third party to perform a risk assessment that includes the identification and walkthrough of key business processes and conducting design and operational control testing to address key risks. 
 Completed a segregation of duties assessment identifying key conflicts and mitigating controls. 
 Initiated the design and implementation of a Segregation of Duties automated tool for our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Additionally, we have initiated the design and implementation of similar controls for the 
 60

 remaining financially relevant applications. Improvements have been implemented in tool utilization to strengthen the segregation of duties. 
 Initiated the design and implementation of controls related to the review of Service Organization Control reports, which cover program change management and computer operations for many of the applications that we rely on for financial reporting. 
 Developed policies and procedures for the quarterly user access review of all users with access to the financially relevant systems and then implemented the quarterly user access review for one design cycle. 
 Initiated the design and implementation of the controls related to review and approval of complex financing transactions. 
 Completed the implementation of an automated month and quarter-end accounting close workflow tool to facilitate the review and support of key financial close process controls. 
 The Company hired personnel with expertise in risk assessment and internal controls. 
 The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management completes the design and implementation of the measures described above, the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The material set forth in the section titled Legal Proceedings in Note 7 of our Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below and those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Other than as described below, there have been no material changes from these risk factors during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We may engage in future acquisitions or strategic transactions which may require us to seek additional financing or financial commitments, increase our expenses and/or present significant distractions to our management. 
 
 In January 2024, we completed our acquisition of SYNQ3 and in August 2024, we completed our acquisition of Amelia and we continue to actively evaluate opportunities to grow and enhance our business and technologies. In the event we engage in an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including by making an investment in another company, we may need to acquire additional financing. Obtaining financing through the issuance or sale of additional equity and/or debt securities, if possible, may not be at favorable terms and may result in additional dilution to our current stockholders. Additionally, any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, an acquisition or strategic transaction, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including the risks outlined above and additionally: 
 
 exposure to unknown financial or product liabilities; 
 disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired products or technologies; 
 higher than expected acquisition and integration costs; 
 write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges; 
 increased amortization expenses; 
 difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel; 
 impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and 
 inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. 
 
 Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 If intangible assets and goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisitions, including our SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions, become impaired, we may have to take significant charges against earnings, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We record goodwill and intangible assets at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill have been impaired. Intangible assets and goodwill will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of intangible assets and goodwill will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in future periods.

 Our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies. 
 
 As a part of our growth strategy, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of complementary products and/or businesses. Any acquisition involves numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations: 
 
 difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel; 
 problems maintaining uniform procedures, controls and policies with respect to our financial accounting systems; 
 lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings; 
 difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations, including risks associated with entering foreign markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; 
 underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid; 
 negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges; 
 the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies; 
 claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction; 
 the assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash; 
 the issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions that dilute the ownership of our stockholders (which in the case of certain of our prior acquisitions were significant); 
 the issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions may not be an option if the price of our common stock is low or volatile which could preclude us from completing any such acquisitions; 
 diversion of management s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business; 
 inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies; 
 the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies; 
 assumption of, or exposure to, historical liabilities of the acquired business, including unknown contingent or similar liabilities, including product liability, that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify; and 
 risks associated with acquiring intellectual property, including potential disputes regarding acquired companies intellectual property. 
 
 In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, finance, legal, and information technologies. There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we may make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure to successfully address the foregoing risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all. 
 
 The integration of our acquisitions, and in particular, our acquisitions of SYNQ3 and Amelia, may result in significant accounting charges that adversely affect the financial results of our company. 
 
 The financial results of our company may be adversely affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with our acquisitions. In addition to the anticipated cash charges, costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets are expected. The price of our common stock could decline to the extent our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing charges or if the foregoing charges are larger than anticipated. 
 
 Our acquisitions may result in unexpected consequences to our business and results of operations. 
 
 Although we believe that our recently acquired businesses will generally be subject to risks similar to those to which we are subject to in our existing operations, we may not have discovered all risks applicable to these businesses during the due diligence process. Some of these risks could produce unexpected and unwanted consequences for us. Undiscovered risks may result in us incurring financial liabilities, which could be material and have a negative impact on our business operations.

 The existence of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting of one of our acquired entities may adversely affect our ability to provide timely and reliable financial results. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in the internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To the extent that any material weakness or significant deficiency exists in the internal control over financial reporting of an acquired entity or a potential acquired entity, such material weakness or significant deficiency may adversely affect our ability to accurately assess such potential acquisition, and, if acquired, may negatively affect our ability to provide timely and reliable financial information necessary for the conduct of our business and the satisfaction of our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. For example, Amelia identified material weaknesses in its reporting system in connection with its fiscal 2023 audit, relating to revenue recognition, financial close processes and income taxes. As of the date of our acquisition of Amelia, such material weaknesses had not yet been successfully remediated. In addition, as disclosed in our Annual Report, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. While we are in the process of addressing our material weaknesses as discussed in our Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 
 
 Failure to realize the benefits expected from our recent acquisitions could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 
 The success of our recent acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to: 
 
 integrate SYNQ3 s and Amelia s customer bases and capitalize on our cross-selling opportunities; 
 realize cost savings from reduced back-office and infrastructure expenses, eliminate duplicative company and management structure costs; 
 operate our combined businesses efficiently, achieve the strategic operating objectives for our business and realize significant cost savings and synergies; 
 realize the attractive risk-adjusted equity returns from our acquisitions for our stockholders; and 
 capitalize on the embedded and/or underexploited expansion opportunities offered by our acquisitions that we can expand upon. 
 
 However, to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions we must successfully integrate their businesses in a manner that permits those benefits and cost savings to be realized. Although we expect benefits to result from these acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully realize these benefits. The challenges involved in this integration will be complex and time consuming and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, and policies that could adversely impact our operations. If we do not successfully manage these and related issues and challenges, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.
