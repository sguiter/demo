2

Proration unit A unit that can be effectively and efficiently drained by one well, as allocated by a governmental agency having regulatory jurisdiction. 

Prospect A specific geographic area which, based on supporting geological, geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs, is deemed to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons. 

Proved developed nonproducing reserves or PDNP means proved reserves that are developed nonproducing reserves. 

Proved developed producing reserves or PDP means proved reserves that are developed producing reserves. 

Proved developed reserves means proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods and can be expected to be recovered through extraction technology installed and operational at the time of the reserve estimate and can be subdivided into PDP and PDNP reserves. 

Proved reserves Those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible crude oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 

(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known crude oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated natural gas cap, proved crude oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: (A) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

Proved undeveloped reserves or PUD means proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Undrilled locations can be classified as PUDs only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that such locations are scheduled to be drilled within five (5) years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. 

PV-10 When used with respect to crude oil and natural gas reserves, PV-10 means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development and abandonment costs, using prices and costs in effect at the determination date, before income taxes, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses, discounted to a present value using an annual discount rate of 10 . PV-10 is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. 

Realized price The cash market price less all expected quality, transportation and demand adjustments. 

Recompletion The process of re-entering an existing wellbore that is either producing or not producing and completing new reservoirs or enhancing existing reservoirs in an attempt to establish or increase existing production. 

Reserves Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of crude oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering crude oil and natural gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

Reservoir A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs. 

3

Resources Quantities of crude oil and natural gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. 

royalty An interest in a crude oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds from the sale thereof) but does not require the owner to pay any portion of the production or development costs on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner. 

SEC means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Senior Credit Facility Agreement means the Company s Credit Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2023, among HighPeak Energy, Inc., as Borrower, Fifth Third Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto. 

Service well A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include natural gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for in-situ combustion. 

Spacing The distance between wells producing from the same reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 100-acre spacing, the distance between horizontal wellbores, e.g., 880-foot spacing or the number of wells per section, e.g., 6-well spacing. It is often established by regulatory agencies and/or the operator to optimize recovery of hydrocarbons. 

Spot market price The cash market price without reduction for expected quality, transportation and demand adjustments. 

Standardized measure The present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent) of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves net of estimated income taxes associated with such net revenues, as determined in accordance with FASB guidelines as well as the rules and regulations of the SEC, without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as indirect general and administrative expenses, and debt service or to DD A. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. 

Stratigraphic test well A drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area. 

Term Loan Credit Agreement means the Company s Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of September 12, 2023, by and between HighPeak Energy, Inc., as borrower, Texas Capital Bank, as administrative agent, Chambers Energy Management, LP, as collateral agent, and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto. 

Undeveloped acreage Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. 

Unit The joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide for development and operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a unitization agreement. 

U.S. means the United States. 

warrants means warrants to purchase one share of HighPeak Energy common stock at a price of 11.50 per share. 

Wellbore The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for crude oil and natural gas production on a completed well. Also called well or borehole. 

Working interes t The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own crude oil, natural gas or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the exploration, development and operating costs on either a cash, penalty or carried basis. 

Workover Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 

WTI means West Texas Intermediate, a light sweet blend of crude oil produced from fields in western Texas and is a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in crude oil pricing. 

With respect to information on the working interest in wells and acreage, net wells and acres are determined by multiplying gross wells and acres by the Company s working interest in such wells or acres. Unless otherwise specified, wells and acreage statistics quoted herein represent gross wells or acres. 

All currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. 

The terms development costs, development project, development well, economically producible, estimated ultimate recovery, exploratory well, production costs, reserves, reservoir, resources, service wells and stratigraphic test well are defined by the SEC. Except as noted, the terms defined in this section are not the same as SEC definitions.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company s future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company s management. In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, plans, expects, anticipates, forecasts, intends, continue, may, will, could, should, future, potential, estimate or the negative of such terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company s current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry in which the Company operates. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, they involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in many cases, beyond the Company s control. In addition, the Company may be subject to currently unforeseen risks that may have a materially adverse effect on it. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that the actual events and results will not be materially different from the anticipated results described in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update these statements except as required by law. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s expectations include, but are not limited to, the Company s assumptions about: 

our ability to refinance or pay, when due, the principal of, interest or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness; 

our liquidity, cash flow and access to capital; 

the supply and demand for and market prices of crude oil, NGL, natural gas and other products or services, and the associated impact of our hedging policies relating thereto; 

capital expenditures and other contractual obligations, including our obligations under our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement; 

the results of our ongoing strategic alternatives review process; 

political instability or armed conflict in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Israel-Iran conflict; 

volatility in the political, legal and regulatory environments ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election; 

political and regulatory uncertainties associated with the upcoming U.S. presidential transition; 

the integration of acquisitions; 

the availability of capital resources; 

production and reserve levels; 

drilling and completion risks; 

inflation rates and the impacts of associated monetary policy responses, including increased interest rates and resulting pressures on economic growth; 

economic and competitive conditions; 

the impacts of revising our drilling plan during the year transitioning to an increased or decreased rig count from time to time; 

severe weather conditions; 

epidemics or pandemics, including the effects of related public health concerns and the impact of continued actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to pandemics and their impact on commodity prices, supply and demand considerations, and storage capacity; 

the availability of goods and services and supply chain issues; 

legislative, regulatory or policy changes; 

regulatory and related policy actions intended by federal, state and/or local governments to reduce fossil fuel use and associated carbon emissions, to drive the substitution of renewable forms of energy for crude oil and natural gas, which may over time reduce demand for crude oil, NGL and natural gas, including as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA 2022 or otherwise; 

our ability to predict and manage the effects of actions of OPEC and agreements to set and maintain production levels, including as a result of recent production cuts by OPEC; 

cyber-attacks; 

occurrence of property acquisitions or divestitures; 

the securities or capital markets and our ability to access such markets on attractive terms or at all, and related risks such as general credit, liquidity, market and interest-rate risks; and 

other factors disclosed under Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024 Annual Report and under Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included in each of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on May 8, 2024, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024 and this Quarterly Report. 

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, or persons acting on its behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no duty to update or revise its forward-looking statements based on changes in internal estimates or expectations or otherwise. 

Additionally, we caution you that reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, NGL and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of crude oil, NGL and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.

million and million, respectively, and are based on estimates of sales volumes and realized prices the Company anticipates it will receive, joint interest receivables of million and million, respectively, receivables related to settlements of derivative contracts of million and million, respectively, and current U.S. federal income tax receivables of million and million, respectively. The Company s share of crude oil, NGL and natural gas production is sold to various purchasers who must be prequalified under the Company s credit risk policies and procedures. The Company s credit risk related to collecting accounts receivables is mitigated by using credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit standing of the entity obligated to make payment on the accounts receivable, and where appropriate, the Company obtains assurances of payment, such as a guarantee by the parent company of the counterparty or other credit support. 

Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from purchasers or joint interest owners, net of an allowance for expected losses as estimated by the Company when collection is doubtful. For receivables from joint interest owners, the Company typically has the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings. Accounts receivable from purchasers or joint interest owners outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance for each type of receivable by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company s previous loss history, the debtor s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off specific accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for expected losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable. 

and , respectively, and sales to the Company s second largest purchaser accounted for approximately and , respectively, of the Company s total crude oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues. The Company generally does not require collateral and does not believe the loss of these particular purchasers would materially impact its operating results, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers in various regions.

Transportation equipment

Total other property and equipment, net 

Other property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Land is not depreciated. Transportation equipment is generally depreciated over five years, buildings are generally depreciated over forty years, field equipment is generally depreciated over seven years and furniture and fixtures is generally depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the underlying terms of the associated leases. 

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recorded is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined using either a discounted future cash flow model or another appropriate fair value method. 

million and million, respectively, included in other noncurrent assets. The Company has received and will continue to receive payments based on gross system throughput, including any third-party natural gas that is potentially tied into the Flat Top gathering system in the future. The contract calls for future aid-in-construction fundings if expansions of the system are necessary as determined in the sole discretion of the Company. 

million and million, respectively, including current maturities of long-term debt, accrued capital expenditures, trade accounts payable, revenues and royalties payable, derivative liabilities and accruals for operating and general and administrative expenses, interest expense, operating leases, dividends and dividend equivalents and other miscellaneous items. 

million in debt issuance costs, and million of which were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily related to the completion of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, the Company incurred million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily related to amendments to the Prior Credit Agreement. Amortization based on the straight-line method over the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, Senior Credit Facility Agreement, Prior Credit Agreement, Senior Notes and Senior Notes which approximates the effective interest method was million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company realized a total of million in original issue discounts on the issuance of its Term Loan Credit Agreement, Senior Notes and Senior Notes that is being amortized over the life of the agreements which approximates the effective interest method and was million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts as of the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement and redemption of the 10.000 Senior Notes and 10.625 Senior Notes during September 2023 were charged to expense and included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 7 for more information. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining net debt issuance costs and discounts related to the Term Loan Credit Agreement are netted against the outstanding long-term debt on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

million and million, respectively. 

Crude Oil Contracts. The Company s crude oil marketing contracts transfer physical custody and title at or near the wellhead, which is generally when control of the crude oil has been transferred to the purchaser. The crude oil produced is sold under contracts using market-based pricing which is then adjusted for the differentials based upon delivery location and crude oil quality. Since the differentials are incurred after the transfer of control of the crude oil, the differentials are included in crude oil sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations as they represent part of the transaction price of the contract. 

Natural Gas Contracts. The majority of the Company s natural gas is sold at the lease location, which is generally when control of the natural gas has been transferred to the purchaser. The natural gas is sold under (i) percentage of proceeds processing contracts or (ii) a hybrid of percentage of proceeds and fee-based contracts. Under the majority of the Company s contracts, the purchaser gathers the natural gas in the field where it is produced and transports it to natural gas processing plants where NGL products are extracted. The NGL products and remaining residue natural gas are then sold by the purchaser. Under percentage of proceeds and hybrid percentage of proceeds and fee-based contracts, the Company receives a percentage of the value for the extracted liquids and the residue natural gas. Since control of the natural gas transfers upstream of the transportation and processing activities, revenue is recognized as the net amount received from the purchaser. 

The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations under its contracts with customers as it applies the practical exemption in accordance with ASC 606. The exemption, as described in ASC 606-10-50-14(a), applies to variable consideration that is recognized as control of the product is transferred to the customer. Since each unit of product represents a separate performance obligation, future volumes are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required. 

Tax-related interest charges are recorded as interest expense and any tax-related penalties as other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations of which there have been none to date. 

The Company is also subject to Texas Margin Tax. The Company realized and zero in current Texas Margin Tax during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Commodity price derivatives. The Company s commodity price derivatives are currently made up of crude oil swap contracts, enhanced collars, costless collars, deferred premium put options and basis swaps. The Company measures derivatives using an industry-standard pricing model that is provided by the counterparties. The inputs utilized in the third-party discounted cash flow and option-pricing models for valuing commodity price derivatives include forward prices for crude oil, contracted volumes, volatility factors and time to maturity, which are considered Level 2 inputs. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Specifically, (i) stock-based compensation is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on Level 1 inputs for restricted stock awards or Level 2 inputs for stock option awards based upon market data, (ii) the estimates and fair value measurements used for the evaluation of proved property for potential impairment using Level 3 inputs based upon market conditions in the area and (iii) asset retirement obligations are measured at estimated fair value on the date the liabilities are incurred using Level 3 inputs based on expected future costs to retire the assets, market conditions and estimated lives of the assets. The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or liability may not be recoverable. These assets and liabilities can include inventories, proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired or held for sale. The Company did not record any impairments to proved or unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for the periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Financial instruments not carried at fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has financial instruments consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt (specifically the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement), and other current assets and liabilities that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and their relatively short maturities.

Crude oil production derivatives. The Company sells its crude oil production at the lease and the sales contracts governing such crude oil production are tied directly to, or are correlated with, NYMEX WTI Cushing and Argus WTI Midland crude oil prices. As such, the Company primarily uses NYMEX WTI Cushing derivative contracts as well as Argus WTI Midland basis swaps to manage future crude oil price volatility. The Argus WTI Midland basis differential represents the amount of premium to NYMEX WTI Cushing. 

The Company s outstanding NYMEX WTI Cushing and Argus WTI Midland crude oil derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and the weighted average crude oil prices and premiums payable per barrel for those contracts are as follows:

Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Company s Second Amended Restated Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, stock awards, dividend equivalents, cash awards and substitute awards to officers, employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The number of shares available for grant pursuant to awards under the LTIP as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows: 

Shares subject to awards issued under plan 

Shares available for future grant 

Stock options. Stock option awards were granted to employees on August 24, 2020, November 4, 2021, May 4, 2022, August 15, 2022 and July 21, 2023. Stock-based compensation expense related to the Company s stock option awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024 there was no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards. The stock options granted in July 2023 were vested upon grant on July 21, 2023. However, to encourage long-term alignment with the Company stockholders, the stock options are not exercisable until the earlier of (i) August 31, 2026, (ii) upon a change in control or (iii) upon the death or disability of the grantee. 

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires the Company to make several assumptions. The expected term of options granted was determined based on the simplified method of the midpoint between the vesting dates and the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve rate for the expected term of the option at the date of grant and the volatility was based on the volatility of either an index of exploration and production crude oil and natural gas companies or on a peer group of companies with similar characteristics of the Company on the date of grant since the Company had minimal or did not have any trading history.

Legal actions. From time to time, the Company may be a party to various proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to these proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The Company records reserves for contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 

Indemnifications. The Company has agreed to indemnify its directors, officers and certain employees and agents with respect to claims and damages arising from acts or omissions taken in such capacity, as well as with respect to certain litigation. 

Environmental. Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and have no future economic benefits are expensed. Environmental expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities for expenditures that will not qualify for capitalization are recorded when environmental assessment and/or remediation is probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments for the liability is fixed or reliably determinable. Environmental liabilities normally involve estimates that are subject to revision until settlement or remediation occurs. 

Crude oil delivery commitments. In September 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated crude oil marketing contract with DK Trading Supply, LLC Delek as the purchaser and DKL Permian Gathering, LLC DKL as the gatherer and transporter. The contract includes the Company s current and future crude oil production from the majority of its horizontal wells in Flat Top and Signal Peak where DKL is continually constructing a crude oil gathering system and custody transfer meters to most of the Company s central tank batteries. The contract contains a minimum volume commitment commencing May 2024 that totals million based on the gross piped barrels delivered of Bopd for the first ten years of the contract at a certain amount per barrel escalating throughout the term of the contract. However, the Company generally has the ability under the contract to cumulatively bank dollars based on excess volumes delivered to offset the minimum volume commitment. For the period from May 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, the Company has delivered approximately Bopd under the contract. The remaining monetary commitment as of September 30, 2024, if the Company never delivers any additional volumes under the agreement, is approximately million. 

Natural gas purchasing replacement contract. In May 2021, the Company entered into a replacement natural gas purchase contract with the gatherer, processor and purchaser of the Company s current and future gross natural gas production in Flat Top. The replacement contract provides the Company with improved natural gas and NGL pricing and required the expansion of the current low-pressure gathering system, which eliminates the need for in-field compression in Flat Top to accommodate the Company s increased natural gas production volumes based on the current plan of development. The Company provides certain aid-in-construction payments to be reimbursed over time based on throughput through the system. The replacement contract does not contain any minimum volume commitments. 

Natural Gas Gathering and Treating Agreement (Signal Peak). In June 2024, the Company entered into a natural gas gathering and treating agreement to gather certain natural gas in its Signal Peak area. Pursuant to said agreement, the Company has agreed to fund certain aid-in-construction costs totaling million through September 30, 2024, million during the remainder of 2024 and million throughout 2025 as certain milestones are attained. The agreement does not contain any minimum volume commitments. 

Power contracts. In June 2022, the Company entered into a contract to provide a block of electric power at an attractive variable rate, which fluctuates based on the usage by the Company through May 31, 2032. In March 2024, the Company entered into a contract to provide an additional block of electric power under similar terms. In conjunction with these contracts, the Company has a million Letter of Credit in place in lieu of a deposit that is cancellable at the end of the contract term. 

Sand commitments. The Company is party to an amended agreement whereby it has agreed to purchase at least tons of sand over a fifteen-month period beginning April 1, 2024. The Company has taken deliveries of approximately tons of sand through September 30, 2024, leaving a commitment of approximately remaining. There are stipulations in the agreement that reduce this commitment should there be a downturn in crude oil prices. Generally, if the Company never takes delivery of any additional sand under the agreement, the monetary commitment that remains as of September 30, 2024 is approximately million.

Water Treatment. In May 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Pilot Exploration, Inc. Pilot to utilize Pilot s proprietary water treatment technology in the Company s Flat Top area to treat produced water such that it can be reused in the Company s completion operations or sold to third parties for their completion operations. During the one-year term of the agreement, beginning on October 1, 2022, the Company agreed to a minimum volume commitment of million barrels of produced water while maintaining the ability to bank excess produced water processed each month toward the minimum volume commitment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid million to Pilot for such services. In April 2023, the Company terminated the contract with Pilot in exchange for million that was paid and charged to other expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

and and Energy Transfer Crude Marketing, LLC ETC accounted for approximately and of the Company s revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Based on the current demand for crude oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers, management believes the loss of either of these major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.

The effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of percent primarily due to deferred state income taxes and other permanent differences between GAAP income and taxable income. 

As required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, ASC 740 the Company uses reasonable judgments and makes estimates and assumptions related to evaluating the probability of uncertain tax positions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on the potential liability related to an assessment of whether the income tax position will more likely than not be sustained in an income tax audit. Based on that analysis, the Company believes the Company has not taken any material uncertain tax positions, and therefore has not recorded an income tax liability related to uncertain tax positions. However, if actual results materially differ, the Company s effective income tax rate and cash flows could be affected in the period of discovery or resolution. The Company also reviews the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the probability of realizing the future benefits of the Company s deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when the Company believes that a portion or all the deferred tax assets may not be realized. If the Company is unable to realize the expected future benefits of its deferred tax assets, the Company is required to provide a valuation allowance. The Company uses its history and experience, overall profitability, future management plans, tax planning strategies, and current economic information to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance to record. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had not recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from its operations because the Company believed they met the more likely than not criteria as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of ASC 740. The Company reversed a portion of its deferred tax asset related to stock-based compensation based on the assumption that the tax deduction will be subject to IRC Section 162(m) limits when the restricted stock vests. IRC Section 162(m) limits compensation deductions to million per year for certain Company executives. This resulted in a million reduction in the deferred tax asset and increased the amount of income tax expense realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company is also subject to Texas margin tax. The Company realized and zero in current Texas margin tax in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company has recognized a net deferred Texas margin tax liability of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion contains certain forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, market prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Please read Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements, except as required by applicable law. 

Overview 

HighPeak Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was formed in October 2019, is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company that explores for, develops and produces crude oil, NGL and natural gas in the Permian Basin in West Texas, more specifically, the Midland Basin. The Company s assets are located primarily in Howard and Borden Counties, Texas, and to a lesser extent Scurry and Mitchell Counties, which lie within the northeastern part of the crude oil-rich Midland Basin. As of September 30, 2024, the assets consisted of two generally contiguous leasehold positions of approximately 147,795 gross (137,207 net) acres, approximately 65 of which were held by production, with an average working interest of approximately 93 . Our acreage is composed of two core areas, Flat Top primarily in the northern portion of Howard County extending into southern Borden County, southwest Scurry County and northwest Mitchell County and Signal Peak in the southern portion of Howard County. We operate approximately 97 of the net acreage across the Company s assets and more than 90 of the net operated acreage provides for horizontal wells with lateral lengths of 10,000 feet or greater. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 89 and 11 of sales volumes from the assets were attributable to liquids (both crude oil and NGL) and natural gas, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, HighPeak Energy was developing its properties using two (2) drilling rigs and one (1) frac crew and expects to average two (2) drilling rigs and one (1) frac crew for the remainder of 2024. 

Recent Events 

Share Repurchase Program. In February 2024, the Board approved a repurchase program of up to 75 million of the Company s common stock. The approval grants management the authority to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market from time to time, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions or by such other means which comply with applicable state and federal laws. This is the Company s first authorization for a stock repurchase program since its founding. 

The Company intends to fund the repurchases from available working capital, cash provided from operations and borrowings under its Senior Credit Facility Agreement. The timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be at the discretion of management and the Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including general market and economic conditions, business conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities available to the Company and compliance with the Company s debt and other agreements. The stock repurchase program does not obligate HighPeak to acquire any particular dollar amount or number of shares of its common stock and the stock repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued by the Company s Board of Directors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of 14.73 per share for a total of approximately 27.2 million, excluding any potential excise taxes. The stock repurchase program authority will expire December 31, 2024. 

Dividends and dividend equivalents. In August 2024, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.04 per share of common stock outstanding which resulted in a total of 5.0 million in dividends being paid in September 2024. In addition, under the terms of the LTIP, the Company paid a dividend equivalent per share to all vested stock option holders of 534,000 in September 2024 and accrued a dividend equivalent per share to all unvested stock option holders which is payable upon vesting, assuming no forfeitures. In addition, the Company accrued an additional combined 86,000 in September 2024 in dividends on the restricted stock issued to directors, management directors and certain employees that will be payable upon vesting. 

Acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a total of 10.4 million in acquisition costs related to lease extensions and to acquire crude oil and natural gas leases covering additional contiguous bolt-on undeveloped acreage contiguous to its Flat Top and Signal Peak operating areas. 

Crude oil sales contract. In September 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated crude oil marketing contract with DK Trading Supply, LLC Delek as the purchaser and DKL Permian Gathering, LLC DKL as the gatherer and transporter. The contract includes the Company s current and future crude oil production from the majority of its horizontal wells in Flat Top and Signal Peak where DKL is continually constructing a crude oil gathering system and custody transfer meters to most of the Company s central tank batteries. The contract contains a minimum volume commitment commencing May 2024 that totals 138.7 million based on the gross piped barrels delivered of 23,500 Bopd for the first ten years of the contract at a certain amount per barrel escalating throughout the term of the contract. However, the Company generally has the ability under the contract to cumulatively bank dollars based on excess volumes delivered to offset the minimum volume commitment. For the period from May 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, the Company has delivered approximately 28,255 Bopd under the contract. The remaining monetary commitment as of September 30, 2024, if the Company never delivers any additional volumes under the agreement, is approximately 133.9 million.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry Considerations. Since mid-2020, crude oil prices have improved, with demand steadily increasing. In addition, sanctions and import bans on Russia have been implemented by various countries in response to the war in Ukraine, further impacting global crude oil supply. As a result of crude oil and natural gas supply constraints, there have been significant increases in European energy costs, which have resulted in inflationary pressures throughout Europe, increasing prospects of recession in many countries throughout the continent. In April 2023, OPEC announced production cuts of around 1.16 million Bopd. On June 4, 2023, OPEC agreed to extend these previously announced production cuts through the end of 2024. On July 3, 2023, Saudi Arabia announced it was extending voluntary cuts through August 2023. In June 2024, OPEC announced it would extend cuts of 3.66 million Bopd through the end of 2025, while gradually phasing out 2.2 million Bopd of voluntary cuts beginning in October 2024. However, as a result of current global supply and demand imbalances, crude oil prices remain strong, although down from the prior year. In addition, the war between Russia and Ukraine and ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran and other tensions in the Middle East have resulted in global supply chain disruptions, which has led to significant cost inflation. 

Global crude oil price levels and inflationary pressures will ultimately depend on various factors that are beyond the Company s control, such as (i) general economic conditions and increasing expectations that the world may be heading into a global recession, (ii) the ability of OPEC and other crude oil producing nations to manage the global crude oil supply, (iii) the impact of sanctions and import bans on production from Russia and any resulting impact on production from the Israel-Hamas and the Israel-Iran conflicts, (iv) the timing and supply impact of any Iranian or Venezuelan sanction relief on their ability to export crude oil, (v) the global supply chain constraints associated with manufacturing and distribution delays, (vi) oilfield service demand and cost inflation, and (vii) political stability of crude oil consuming countries. The Company continues to assess and monitor the impact of these factors and consequences on the Company and its operations. 

Outlook 

HighPeak Energy s financial position and future prospects, including its revenues, operating results, profitability, liquidity, future growth and the value of its assets, depend heavily on prevailing commodity prices. The crude oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices are highly volatile and subject to a high degree of uncertainty. For example, during the period from January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2024, the calendar month average NYMEX WTI crude oil price per Bbl ranged from a low of 16.70 to a high of 114.34, and the last trading day NYMEX natural gas price per MMBtu ranged from a low of 1.50 to a high of 9.35. 

The market for crude oil strengthened in 2021 from historic lows in 2020 and continued to remain strong in 2023 and continuing in 2024, although the market has decreased from 2022 levels overall, as a result of increased supply outpacing increased demand. However, there are many factors beyond the Company s control, including commodity markets, unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, frac crews and oilfield services or supply constraints remain subject to heightened levels of uncertainty as a result of the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas and Israel and Iran, elevated interest rates and associated policies of the Federal Reserve, which could adversely affect HighPeak Energy. For additional information on the risks, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024 (the Annual Report ). 

Given the dynamic nature of this situation, the Company is maintaining flexibility in its capital plan as indicated by its anticipated two (2) drilling rig program for the remainder of 2024. The Company will continue to evaluate drilling and completion activity on an economic basis, with future activity levels assessed monthly. Despite continuing impacts of the factors listed above and future uncertainty, we are focused on maintaining our ability to sustain strong operational performance and financial stability while maximizing returns, improving leverage metrics, and increasing the value of our Midland Basin assets.

Strategic Alternatives 

On January 23, 2023, the Company announced the intention of its Board to initiate a process to evaluate certain strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including a potential sale of the Company. Texas Capital Securities and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC have been retained as a financial advisors with respect to this strategic alternatives process. To date, however, this process has been exploratory in nature and accordingly remains in preliminary stages, with our discussions to date with prospective counterparties generally excluding substantive discussions or key transaction terms. The Company has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor has it made any decisions related to any further actions or potential strategic alternatives at this time. There can be no assurance that the review will progress beyond this exploratory phase or result in any transaction or other strategic change or outcome. The Company does not intend to comment further regarding the strategic alternatives process unless and until our Board has approved a specific course of action or we have otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.

The Company's financial and operating performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included the highlights described below and comparative discussion of related drivers for the three months ended September 30, 2023: 

Net income was 49.9 million 0.35 per diluted share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 38.8 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary components of the 11.1 million increase in net income include: 

a 62.0 million decrease in the Company s derivative instruments loss from a 29.7 million loss in the prior year period compared with a 42.6 million gain in the current year quarter as a result of its crude oil commodity contracts entered into and the change in crude oil prices thereafter; 

a 27.3 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt due to the Company s refinancing of its long-term debt in September 2023 which caused a loss to be recognized at the time the prior debt was repaid and terminated; 

a 10.3 million decrease in the Company s stock-based compensation expense primarily due to stock options that were granted during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that were 100 vested upon issuance and thus the expense was recognized at the time of grant compared with none being granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024; 

a 4.4 million decrease in the Company s crude oil and natural gas production costs primarily as a result of lower chemical and other treating costs throughout Flat Top specifically; and 

a 3.4 million decrease in production and ad valorem taxes, primarily attributable to the 19 decrease in average realized commodity prices per Boe, excluding the effects of derivatives, plus a 3 decrease in daily sales volumes resulting primarily from a major rain storm at the beginning of September that caused a significant amount of flooding and shut in a significant amount of production for a short time, effecting current quarter sales volumes by approximately 750 Boe per day in addition to a production decline resulting from a reduced two-rig development schedule compared with the four to six drilling rigs we were running in early 2023, partially offset by increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third party midstream expansions and debottlenecking, partially offset by an increase in ad valorem taxes in the State of Texas due to the continued growth of the Company s property base; 

a 2.0 million decrease in the Company s general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to prior year bonus accrual beginning in the third quarter whereas during the current year the Company has accrued projected bonuses quarterly, partially offset by higher salaries and benefits as well as an increase in professional fees, all primarily as a result of the growth of the Company; 

a 1.4 million decrease in the Company s exploration and abandonment expense primarily due to less leasehold abandonments; and 

a 1.4 million increase in the Company s interest income due to the increased cash on hand; 

Partially offset by: 

a 74.0 million decrease in crude oil, NGL and natural gas revenues due to a 19 decrease in average realized commodity prices per Boe, excluding the effects of derivatives, plus a 3 decrease in daily sales volumes resulting primarily from a major rain storm at the beginning of September that caused a significant amount of flooding and shut in a significant amount of production for a short time, affecting current quarter sales volumes by approximately 750 Boe per day in addition to a production decline resulting from a reduced two-rig development schedule compared with the four to six drilling rigs we were running in early 2023, partially offset by increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third party midstream expansions and debottlenecking; 

a 19.2 million increase in DD A expense due to a 19 increase in the DD A rate from 24.21 to 28.91 per Boe as a result of significant inflationary pressures on capital costs, partially offset by a 3 decrease in daily sales volumes resulting primarily from a major rain storm that caused a significant amount of flooding that occurred at the beginning of September and shut in a significant amount of production for a short time, effecting current quarter sales volumes by approximately 750 Boe per day in addition to a production decline resulting from a reduced two-rig development schedule compared with the four to six drilling rigs we were running in early 2023, partially offset by increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third party midstream expansions and debottlenecking; 

a 5.6 million increase in interest expense due to the increase in the Company s overall indebtedness and higher interest rates, partially offset by decreased amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts; 

a 1.3 million increase in the Company s income tax expense primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes; and 

a 864,000 increase in the Company s other expense primarily as a result of the repair of a production facility that continued into the third quarter of 2024; 

31

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average daily sales volumes totaled 51,346 Boepd, compared with 52,708 Boepd during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 3 , due to a major rain storm that caused a significant amount of flooding that occurred at the beginning of September and shut in a significant amount of production for a short time, effecting current quarter sales volumes by approximately 800 Boe per day in addition to a production decline resulting from a reduced two-rig development schedule compares with the four to six drilling rigs we were running in early 2023, partially offset by increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third party midstream expansions and debottlenecking. 

Weighted average realized crude oil prices per Bbl, excluding the effects of derivatives, decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 75.99, compared with 82.87 for the same period in 2023. Weighted average NGL prices per Bbl increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 21.14, compared with 20.08 for the same period in 2023. Weighted average natural gas prices per Mcf decreased to 0.42 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.89 during the same period in 2023. 

Cash provided by operating activities totaled 177.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 158.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, HighPeak Energy was developing its properties using two (2) drilling rigs and one (1) frac crew. The continued threat of an extensive recession, the scope, duration and magnitude of the direct and indirect effects of pandemics, the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas and Israel-Iran conflicts and the production cuts announced by OPEC are continuing to evolve and in ways that are difficult or impossible to anticipate. Given the dynamic nature of this situation, the Company is maintaining flexibility with its capital plan and will continue to evaluate drilling and completion activity on an economic basis, with future activity levels assessed monthly. 

33

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company successfully completed and placed on production fifty-one (51) gross (41.4 net) horizontal wells, forty-seven (47) gross (37.9 net) in the Flat Top area and four (4) gross (3.5 net) in the Signal Peak area. The Company also placed one salt-water disposal well in service in its Flat Top area during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had seventeen (17) gross (16.9 net) horizontal wells that had been drilled and were in various stages of completion in the Flat Top area and two (2) gross (2.0 net) horizontal wells that had been drilled and were in various stages of completion in the Signal Peak area. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was in the process of drilling five (5) gross (5.0 net) horizontal wells, all in the Flat Top area.

The decrease in overall sale volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of a major storm at the beginning of September that caused a significant amount of flooding and shut in a significant amount of production for a short time, effecting current quarter sales volumes by approximately 750 Boe per day in addition to a production decline resulting from a reduced two-rig development schedule compared with the four to six drilling rigs we were running in early 2023, partially offset by increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third party midstream expansions and debottlenecking. The increase in average daily Boe sales volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the Company s successful horizontal drilling program and increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third-party midstream expansions and debottlenecking, partially offset by the aforementioned storm and decline resulting from the reduced drilling program. 

The crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market prices received for each commodity. The weighted average realized prices, excluding the effects of derivatives, are as follows:

As detailed above, the decrease in total operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is the result of a 19 decrease in average realized price per Boe coupled with a 3 decrease in average daily sales volumes primarily as a result of a major storm at the beginning of September that caused a significant amount of flooding and shut in a significant amount of production for a short time, effecting current quarter sales volumes by approximately 750 Boe per day in addition to a production decline resulting from a reduced two-rig development schedule compared with the four to six drilling rigs we were running in early 2023, partially offset by increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third party midstream expansions and debottlenecking. Also as detailed above, the increase in total operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is the result of a 13 increase in average daily sales volumes primarily as a result of the Company s successful horizontal drilling program and increased NGL and natural gas sales volumes due to third-party midstream expansions and debottlenecking, partially offset by the aforementioned storm and decline resulting from the reduced drilling program, partially offset by a 9 decrease in average realized price per Boe.

The decrease in crude oil and natural gas production costs quarter over quarter can be attributed primarily to lower treating and chemical costs and year over year can be attributed primarily to lower treating and chemical costs and lower expense workover costs as well as lower power and fuel costs with the continued reduction in generator power used throughout the field now that we have overhead electric covering the majority of our properties.

In general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity sales volumes and price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon an asset valuation assessed by the state as of January 1 of that particular year based on prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year sales revenues at current commodity prices. Overall, the decrease in production and ad valorem taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 can be attributed primarily to the 19 decrease in overall commodity prices received in addition to the 3 aforementioned decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in ad valorem taxes due to the increased property base of the Company. Overall, the increase in production and ad valorem taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 can be primarily attributed to the 13 aforementioned increase in sales volumes partially offset by a 9 decrease in overall commodity prices received and an increase in ad valorem taxes due to the increased property base of the Company.

The decrease in production taxes per Boe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023 can be attributed primarily to the lower commodity prices received in 2024. The decrease in ad valorem taxes per Boe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to the Company efforts working with the counties to reduce valuations for 2024.

The decrease in general and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the prior year period including nine months of accrued employee bonuses whereas in 2024 we began accruing quarterly in the first quarter and thus only three months are included in the current year period. The increase in general and administrative expense and general and administrative expense per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily a result of adding new employees and increased salaries and benefits related to the growth of the Company in addition to higher professional services costs related to the growth of the Company.

The increase in interest expense can be attributed to a higher overall debt balance in 2024 compared with 2023 and higher interest rates in 2024 primarily on our Term Loan Credit Agreement compared with interest rates in 2023 on our Prior Credit Agreement, 10.000 Senior Notes and 10.625 Senior Notes. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in amortization of discounts and debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of our longer term 1.2 billion Term Loan Credit Agreement in mid-September 2023.

The Company primarily utilizes commodity swap contracts, costless collars, deferred premium collars and deferred premium put option contracts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company s annual capital budget and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The Company s Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement require, and previously the Prior Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Company s 10.000 Senior Notes and 10.625 Senior Notes required, the Company to hedge certain quantities of its projected crude oil production. The Company may also, from time to time, utilize interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company s indebtedness. The above mark-to-market gain (loss) and cash settlements relate to crude oil derivative swap contracts, deferred premium collars and deferred premium put option contracts.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 1.2 million and 3.2 million, respectively, primarily related to repairs on a damaged production facility which resulted in a delay in turning several newly completed wells online and 181,000 and 181,000, respectively, related to damages sustained during the major rain storm that caused significant flooding throughout the field resulting in a significant amount of production being off-line for a short period of time. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid zero and 6.5 million, respectively, to buyout and terminate a water treatment contract with a former outside board member and incurred other costs of 540,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, primarily related to repairs on production facilities that were damaged in a fire that shut in a significant amount of production for a short time.

The change in provision for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to the change in income before income taxes for both periods and the reversal of a deferred tax asset related to a temporary difference from restricted stock being reclassified to a permanent difference. The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to certain aforementioned stock-based compensation revisions, Texas state income taxes and other permanent differences between GAAP income and taxable income. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)" for additional information. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity . The Company s primary sources of short-term liquidity are (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) net cash provided by operating activities, (iii) unused borrowing capacity under the Senior Credit Facility Agreement, (iv) on an opportunistic basis, other issuances of debt or equity securities and (v) sales of nonstrategic assets. 

The Company s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) near-term debt maturities, including quarterly mandatory payments under our Term Loan Credit Agreement, (iii) payments of other contractual obligations, (iv) acquisitions of crude oil and natural gas properties and (v) working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of the Company s sources of liquidity. 

2024 capital budget . The Company s capital budget for 2024 is expected to be in the range of approximately 540 to 580 million for drilling, completion, facilities and equipping crude oil wells and for field infrastructure buildout and other costs. The 2024 capital budget excludes acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, geological and geophysical expenses, general and administrative expenses and corporate facilities. HighPeak Energy expects to fund its forecasted capital expenditures with cash on its consolidated balance sheet, cash generated by operations and borrowing capacity available under its Senior Credit Facility Agreement. The Company s capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 451.8 million, excluding acquisitions. 

37

However, there are many factors and consequences beyond the Company s control impacting our capital budget, such as policies of the Biden Administration, political and regulatory uncertainties associated with the upcoming U.S. presidential transition, economic downturn or potential recession, geo-political risks and additional actions by businesses, OPEC and other cooperating countries, and governments in response to pandemics, that may have an impact on the Company s future results and drilling plans. For additional information on the risks, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report. The Company is maintaining flexibility in its capital plan and will continue to evaluate drilling and completion activity on an economic basis, with future activity levels assessed monthly.

(125 

Operating activities . The increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2023, was primarily related to an increase in discretionary cash flow as a result of an increase in revenues less operating and general administrative expenses of approximately 14.0 million associated with increased production volumes as a result of our successful horizontal drilling program and cost cutting efforts related primarily to power generation and treating and chemical costs plus an increase in other current assets and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivables. 

Investing activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2023, was primarily due to decreases in additions to crude oil and natural gas properties when the Company had fewer drilling rigs and frac crews running on average compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing activities. The Company's significant financing activities are as follows: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024: The Company made mandatory payments on its Term Loan Credit Facility totaling 90.0 million, paid 27.2 million to repurchase 1,849,636 shares of its common stock at an average cost of approximately 14.73 per share, excluding any potential excise taxes, and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of 15.1 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2023: The Company borrowed 1.17 billion on the Term Loan Credit Agreement, net of a 30.0 million original issue discount, and 255.0 million on the Prior Credit Agreement, received 155.8 million from a public offering of 14,835,000 shares of common stock and 1.7 million and 148,000 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options, respectively, partially offset by the repayment of the Prior Credit Agreement, 10.625 Senior Notes and 10.000 Senior Notes of 525.0 million, 250.0 million and 225.0 million, respectively, payment of a make whole premium on the 10.625 Senior Notes of 4.5 million, payment of debt issuance costs and stock issuance costs totaling 26.4 million and 5.4 million, respectively, and the payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of 8.7 million and 903,000, respectively. 

Interest Rate Risk. We are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates associated with any outstanding balance on the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Senior Credit Facility Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had a 1.11 billion outstanding balance on the Term Loan Credit Agreement and zero outstanding on the Senior Credit Facility Agreement. Our Term Loan Credit Agreement fixes the interest rate for all of the principal balance of the Term Loan Credit Agreement at the end of each quarter for a period of three months and the Senior Credit Facility Agreement allows us to fix the interest rate for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period of six months. To the extent the interest rate is fixed, interest rate changes will affect the Term Loan Credit Agreement s and Senior Credit Facility Agreement s fair value but will not impact results of operations or cash flows. Conversely, for the portion of the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement that has a floating interest rate, interest rate changes will not affect the fair value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows. 

Commodity Price Risk. The prices we receive for our crude oil, NGL and natural gas production directly impact our revenue, profitability, access to capital, and future rate of growth. Crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices are subject to unpredictable fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including changes in supply and demand and the macroeconomic environment, and seasonal anomalies, all of which are typically beyond our control. The markets for crude oil, NGL and natural gas have been volatile, especially over the last several years. Commodity prices have improved from historic lows in 2020 resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, commodity prices are subject to heightened levels of uncertainty related to geopolitical issues such as the ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas and Israel and Iran. The realized prices we receive for our production also depend on numerous factors that are typically beyond our control. Based on our sales volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and excluding the effects on derivatives, a 1.00 per barrel increase (decrease) in the weighted average crude oil price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased (decreased) the Company s revenues by approximately 15.1 million on an annualized basis and a 0.10 per Mcf increase (decrease) in the weighted average natural gas price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased (decreased) the Company s revenues by approximately 1.2 million on an annualized basis. 

We enter into commodity derivative contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices. The fair value of our commodity derivative contracts is largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices. As of September 30, 2024, a 1.00 increase (decrease) in the forward curves associated with our crude oil commodity derivative instruments would have decreased (increased) our net derivative positions for these products by approximately 9.1 million. 

Contractual obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include leases (primarily related to contracted drilling rigs, equipment and office facilities), capital funding obligations and other liabilities. Other joint owners in the properties operated by the Company could incur portions of the costs represented by these commitments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

EBITDAX represents net income before interest expense, interest and other income, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, and amortization, accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations, exploration and abandonment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, noncash derivative gains and losses, other expense, gains and losses on divestitures and certain other items. EBITDAX excludes certain items we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally non-recurring in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that we believe provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. In addition, EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the crude oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or other profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income and may vary among companies, the EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. 

We are also subject to financial covenants under our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement based on EBITDAX ratios as further described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this Quarterly Report. The Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement provide a material source of liquidity for us. Under the terms of our Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Senior Credit Facility Agreement, if we fail to comply with the covenants that establish a maximum permitted ratio of total net leverage or a minimum permitted ratio of asset coverage, we would be in default, an event that would accelerate repayments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and prevent us from borrowing under the Senior Credit Facility Agreement and would therefore materially limit a significant source of our liquidity. In addition, if we are in default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Senior Credit Facility Agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver of that default from our lenders, they would be entitled to exercise all their remedies for default. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of our net income (GAAP) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods presented (in thousands):

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Our historical condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done, and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. 

In management s opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for crude oil and natural gas activities, crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations, accounting and valuation of nonmonetary transactions, litigation and environmental contingencies, valuation of financial derivative instruments, uncertain tax positions and income taxes. 

Management s judgments and estimates in all the areas listed above are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known. 

There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and procedures during the three months ended September 30, 2024. See our disclosure of critical accounting policies in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report. 

New accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted. The effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)." 

39

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company s major market risk exposure is the pricing it receives for its sales of crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Pricing for crude oil, NGL and natural gas has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and HighPeak Energy expects this volatility to continue in the future. 

During the period from January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2024, the calendar month average NYMEX WTI crude oil price per Bbl ranged from a low of 16.70 to a high of 114.34, and the last trading day NYMEX natural gas price per MMBtu ranged from a low of 1.50 to a high of 9.35. A 1.00 per barrel increase (decrease) in the weighted average crude oil price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased (decreased) the Company s revenues by approximately 15.1 million on an annualized basis, excluding the effects of derivatives, and a 0.10 per Mcf increase (decrease) in the weighted average natural gas price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased (decreased) the Company s revenues by approximately 1.2 million on an annualized basis, excluding the effects of derivatives. 

Due to this volatility, the Company uses commodity derivative instruments, such as swaps, puts and collars, to hedge price risk associated with a portion of anticipated production. These hedging instruments allow the Company to reduce, but not eliminate, the potential effects of the variability in cash flow from operations due to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices and provide increased certainty of cash flows for its drilling program. These instruments provide only partial price protection against declines in crude oil and natural gas prices and may partially limit the Company s potential gains from future increases in prices. The Company enters into hedging arrangements to protect its capital expenditure budget. The Company s Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement require the Company to hedge certain quantities of its projected crude oil production. The Company does not enter into any commodity derivative instruments, including derivatives, for speculative or trading purposes. 

Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk. The Company s derivative contracts, if any, expose it to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. It is anticipated that if the Company enters into any commodity contracts, the collateral defined in the Collateral Agency Agreement may be used as collateral for the Company s commodity derivatives. The Company evaluates the credit standing of its counterparties as it deems appropriate. It is anticipated that any counterparties to HighPeak Energy s derivative contracts would have investment grade ratings. 

The Company s principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables from the sale of crude oil and natural gas production due to the concentration of its crude oil and natural gas receivables with a few significant customers. The inability or failure of the Company s significant customers to meet their obligations to the Company or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect the Company s financial results. 

The average forward prices based on September 30, 2024 market quotes were as follows:

3.02 

Credit Risk. The Company's primary concentration of credit risk is associated with (i) the collection of receivables resulting from the sale of crude oil and natural gas production and (ii) the risk of a counterparty's failure to meet its obligations under derivative contracts with the Company. 

The Company monitors exposure to counterparties primarily by reviewing credit ratings, financial criteria and payment history. Where appropriate, the Company obtains assurances of payment, such as a guarantee by the parent company of the counterparty or other credit support. The Company's crude oil and natural gas is sold to various purchasers who must be prequalified under the Company's credit risk policies and procedures. Historically, the Company's credit losses on crude oil and natural gas receivables have not been material. 

The Company uses credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit standing of, and to select, counterparties to its derivative instruments. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments, associated credit risk is mitigated by the Company s credit risk policies and procedures. 

The Company entered into International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements ISDA Agreements with its derivative counterparties. The terms of the ISDA Agreements provide the Company and the counterparties with right of set off upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either the Company or a counterparty to a derivative contract, whereby the party not in default may set off all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all derivative asset receivables from the defaulting party. 

Interest Rate Risk. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.11 billion outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and had 93.1 million of available borrowing capacity under the Senior Credit Facility Agreement. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt from our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Senior Credit Facility Agreement. The Company also periodically has fixed rate debt but does not currently utilize derivative instruments to manage the economic effect of changes in interest rates. The impact of a 1 increase in interest rates on our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 would have resulted in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately 11.1 million.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, HighPeak Energy has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including HighPeak Energy s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, HighPeak Energy s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, the Company may be a party to various lawsuits, proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to these proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future results of operations. 

On May 29, 2024, a purported HighPeak stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against various current and former HighPeak directors, alleging that the Company s directors breached their fiduciary duties in approving the compensation awarded to the Company s CEO and President and that the Company s CEO was unjustly enriched by the compensation. The initial complaint alleged that the Company s directors engaged in an inadequate process and approved excessive compensation in the years 2020 through 2023. After the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September 30, 2024. The amended complaint removed the plaintiff s challenge to the Company s President s compensation, but it continues to challenge the compensation awarded to the Company s CEO in at least 2022, 2023, and 2024. The plaintiff seeks to recover purported damages on behalf of the Company, disgorgement of the Company s CEO s compensation, an order requiring HighPeak to make various changes to its corporate governance policies, attorneys fees, and other relief. The Company believes the lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report, the risks that are discussed in the Company s Annual Report under the headings Risk Factors, Business and Properties, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, should be carefully considered, as such risks could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition or future results. There has been no material change in the Company's risk factors that were described in the Company s Annual Report.

The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

(a) 

Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

(b) 

Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

5. 

The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

(a) 

All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
