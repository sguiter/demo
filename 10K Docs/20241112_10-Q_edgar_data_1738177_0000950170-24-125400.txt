Note regarding forward-looking statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, forward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, they should not be relied upon as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include: 
 the unpredictability of our operating results; 

our ability to successfully comply with or obtain a waiver of compliance with the financial covenants under our secured credit facilities; 

the sufficiency of our cash resources, our ability to negotiate covenant relief with our lenders and needs for additional financing; 

the impact if in future we are required to write down goodwill or other intangible assets; 

our ability to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and network operators' changing needs; 

our ability to forecast future demand or the level of inventory in our channel, which could adversely affect our commitments to our suppliers and our channel partners' ability to effectively manage inventory of our products, timely resell our products or estimate expected future demand; 

our ability to manage inventory and the risk of excess or obsolete inventory in our channel; 

the impact of competitive pressures on the development of new products; 

risks caused by political tensions around the world including the current war in Ukraine as well as tensions between the United States and China and events in Israel, Gaza and the Middle East; 

the strength of the United States dollar and the impact on the cost of our products globally; 

current or future unfavorable economic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets, including the risk of global or localized recessions; 

our limited or sole source suppliers' inability to acquire or produce third-party components to build our products and the impact of supply shortages, extended lead times or changes in supply of components and other parts required to manufacture our products; 

our reliance on third-party manufacturers, which subjects us to risks of product delivery delays and reduced control over product costs and quality; 

our reliance on distributors and value-added resellers for the substantial majority of our sales; 

the inability of our third-party logistics and warehousing providers to deliver products to our channel partners and network operators in a timely manner; 

our distributors' and channel partners' inability to attract new network operators or sell additional products to network operators that currently use our products; 

the technological complexity of our products, which may contain undetected hardware defects or software bugs or subject our products to the risks of ransomware or malware or other cyber attacks; 

our channel partners' inability to effectively manage inventory of our products, timely resell our products or estimate expected future demand; 

credit risk of our channel partners, which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products; 

the impact of any material weaknesses in and our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls, produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations; 

ii 

the impact of actual or threatened health epidemics and other outbreaks; 

our reliance on the availability of third-party licenses; 

our inability to obtain intellectual property protections for our products; and 

our ability to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. 

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

Inventories, net 

The decrease in finished goods inventory was primarily in our PMP and Enterprise products. Inventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, and market conditions and judgment about the anticipated future consumption and our ability to sell the inventory. At December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 , excess and obsolescence reserves were million and million, respectively. The increase in the reserve in 2024 was mostly driven by lower demand, mostly for PMP products. Accrued liabilities

During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the qualitative assessment completed on the Company's long-lived assets indicated the existence of impairment triggers such that the Company would need to assess the undiscounted cash flows at the asset group level for recoverability. Based on the quantitative assessment performed, management concluded the assets were recoverable and impairment charge was recorded.

change in the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited). The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group below its carrying amount and tests intangible assets if an indicator suggests that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company completes a quarterly qualitative triggering events assessment which considers significant events and circumstances such as a reporting unit s historical and current results, assumptions regarding future performance, operating income or cash flows, strategic initiatives and overall economic factors, including significant negative industry or economic trends and macro-economic developments, and sustained declines in the Company's share price or market capitalization, considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers, to determine whether any of these may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced a debt covenant breach and a decline in its market capitalization as a result of a sustained decrease in the trading price of the Company's shares, each which represented triggering events requiring management to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024. The Company engaged a third party valuation firm to assist in preparing the interim goodwill impairment valuations as of September 30, 2024. For the assessment of goodwill, management determined it operates as reporting unit and compared the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. Both an income and market approach were used in determining the fair value of its one reporting unit. The income approach, or discounted cash flow method, utilized the Company's current forecast based on management's estimates of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and working capital projections. The residual value was captured utilizing the Gordon Growth method and the discount rate was determined based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital. The market approach used was the Guideline Public Company ("GPC") method which valued the Company based on trading multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are similar to the Company. The trailing-twelve-month, 2024 estimate and 2025 estimate enterprise value-to-revenue multiples were used to value the Company. Multiples were selected based on a review of the multiple indications derived from the GPCs and the comparable company multiples were reviewed for differences in growth prospects, profitability and risk profiles between the Company and the GPCs. Based on the results of the quantitative assessments, the fair value of the Company's one reporting unit was marginally in excess of its carrying value and the Company's goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2024. When estimating the future cash flows of the Company's one reporting unit, the Company generally assumed revenue in future years would increase with a return to normalized consumption levels across all product lines in the short-term, and future growth rates in line with the expected industry growth rate, and increased operating margins in future years would improve as a result of improved gross margins, mostly due to managing product costs and a reduction of excess and obsolete charges, along with reduced operating expenses as a result of the corporate restructurings and a continued emphasis on controlling discretionary spending. However, if overall market conditions deteriorate, the Company is unable to achieve its forecasted results, or the trading price of its shares continue to decline, future non-cash impairment charges may result which could be material. The Company also considered its long-lived assets (including intangible assets with definite useful lives), which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company engaged the same third party valuation firm used for the goodwill impairment assessment to assist with the interim long-lived asset recoverability test at September 30, 2024. These assets are reviewed for 

 10 

months. The undiscounted cash flows of the asset group was estimated on a pre-tax basis over the life of the primary asset. Since the asset group constitutes a reporting unit or a business, a residual value was included to capture the approximate proceeds from the eventual disposition of the business. A terminal value approach was used to determine the residual value of the business. The carrying value of the asset group was determined to be the Company's invested capital less debt plus equity. The asset group's recoverability was determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group. Based on the results of the quantitative assessment, the undiscounted cash flows were greater than the carrying value of the asset group, and the asset group was recoverable at September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor for potential impairment should these impairment indicators continue or new impairment indicators arise. to

The increase in the effective interest rate is being driven mostly by the higher applicable margin as a result of the amendment completed on December 29, 2023. The Company borrowed million against its revolving credit facility during the first half of 2024 for working capital and normal operations. As of September 30, 2024 , the weighted-average interest rate for borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility was (unaudited). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has made all required quarterly principal and interest payments. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with its monthly liquidity covenant at each measurement date during the quarter. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with its quarterly consolidated EBITDA covenant. This non-payment event of default affords the bank the right to declare the amounts immediately due and payable on the outstanding term loan principal amount of million and the outstanding revolving credit facility amount of million. The Company is seeking a forbearance from Bank of America, as lender under the Amended Credit Agreement, and is working with the bank to address its noncompliance with the covenant. There can be no assurances that the bank will provide such an agreement and may declare a default and require immediate payment. The term loan facility and revolving credit facility mature on November 17, 2026, however, the covenant violation gives the bank the right to require immediate payment of the outstanding amounts. Accordingly, the entire million outstanding on the term loan facility and the million outstanding under the revolving credit facility have been classified as current and included in Current portion of long-term debt, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. Further, the million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the term loan facility are classified as current and included in Current portion of long-term debt, net and million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility are classified as current and included in Other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024.

Of the RSUs vested, the Company withheld of those shares to pay the employees portion of the minimum payroll withholding taxes. The fair value of the RSUs is based on the fair value of the Company's ordinary shares on the grant date. The Company utilized a forfeiture rate of d uring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 for estimating the forfeitures of RSUs granted. As of September 30, 2024, there was m illion in unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested time-based restricted share units. The unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized through the third quarter of 2028 (unaudited). Performance-based share awards In May 2023, performance-based share awards were awarded to select executive officers of the Company. The awards contain a performance-based vesting criteria and included share options and restricted share units. The performance-based awards have two separate annual performance periods, with of the performance-based awards vesting over each of the annual performance periods ending on December 31, 2023 ("First Performance Period") and December 31, 2024 ("Second Performance Period") if the performance goal is met. If the performance goal for that performance period is not met, the performance-based awards do not vest and are forfeited. The performance goal is based on the Company's adjusted earnings per share, as publicly reported by the Company, for each performance period. The method used to measure the fair value of the performance-based awards is consistent with the methods used to measure the fair value of time-based share options and RSUs, as described above. During 2023, the share options were forfeited prior to the end of the performance periods due to employee termination. For performance-based awards that vest during the First Performance Period, the Company's Compensation Committee retained the ability to modify the applicable adjusted earnings per share metric. Due to this discretion, the Company determined that the grantee does not have a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the performance-based awards in the First Performance Period, and a grant date will not exist until the Compensation Committee approves the adjusted earnings per share metric for the First Performance Period. On January 29, 2024, the Compensation Committee determined the performance goals for the First Performance Period were not achieved and the total potential shares of RSUs were forfeited (unaudited). Unlike the performance-based awards in the First Performance Period, the Compensation Committee does not have the discretion to modify the applicable adjusted earnings per share metric for performance-based awards that vest during the Second Performance Period. As such, a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions, and thus a grant date, exists on the date that the performance-based awards are issued by the Company. As of September 30, 2024 , based on the total potential shares that could be earned, there were RSUs granted. A grant date fair value was established, and the weighted average grant date fair values calculated in the above tables include these performance-based RSUs. The Company has not recognized any compensation expense on these performance-based awards since the achievement of the performance goal is not probable. As of September 30, 2024 , there was million in unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to these unvested performance-based share awards for the Second Performance Period, which will be recognized over the requisite service period from January 1, 2024 through the first quarter of 2025 if it is probable that the adjusted earnings per share metric will be achieved (unaudited). Employee share purchase plan In June 2019, the Company s Board of Directors adopted, and its shareholders approved, the Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP ). The ESPP was effective on June 25, 2019, and the initial offering period of six months commenced on January 1, 2021. The current offering period of six months commenced on July 1, 2024 and runs through December 31, 2024. The purchase price of the shares is of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s ordinary shares on the first trading day of the offering period and the purchase date. The ESPP includes an annual increase to the shares available for sale on the first day of each fiscal year beginning

The Company registered additional shares on March 18, 2024. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recognized milli on and million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to the ESPP. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to the ESPP. There were shares issued under the ESPP during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 . There were shares issued under the ESPP during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited).

million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 and a provision for income taxes of million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 , with an effective tax rate of and , respectively. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 , the Company's effective tax rate of was different from the statutory rate of , primarily due to establishment of a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of the UK company, net of tax benefit on Foreign Derived Intangible Income, tax benefit arising on US Research and Development tax credits, and changes to the excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 , the Company s effective tax rate of was different from the statutory rate of , primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of the UK company, maintaining a full valuation allowance on the net UK deferred tax assets. In the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded a tax provision of million and tax provision of million, respectively, with an effective income tax rate of and , respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 , the effective income tax rate of was different from the statutory rate of , primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets on the UK company, net of tax benefit on Foreign Derived Intangible Income, tax benefits arising on US Research and Development tax credits, and changes to the excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 , the effective income tax rate of was different from the statutory rate of , primarily due to the implementation of a tax method change in the U.S. related to the tax capitalization of the Company's research and development expenditures, resulting in a provision-to-return impact, and a corresponding reduction in the required U.S. valuation allowance, while also including in the period an increase in the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of the UK company, maintaining a full valuation allowance on the net UK deferred tax assets. The Company increased the valuation allowance based on the analysis of cumulative income and loss positions, future income projections, and operating plans. The UK net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023 were comprised primarily of NOL carryforwards, corporate interest restriction carryforwards and acquired intangibles, amounting to million, fully reserving the UK net deferred tax assets. The UK valuation allowance increased during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 by million and million, respectively, for a total valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 of million, fully reserving the UK net deferred tax assets. The U.S. net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023 were comprised primarily of capitalized research costs and share-based compensation, amounting to million. The U.S. net deferred tax assets decreased during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 by million and million, respectively, as a result of the tax method change referenced above, the Company began deducting a significant portion of its previously capitalized research and development expenditures for tax purposes, which reduced the total U.S. net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 of million. The U.S. partial valuation allowance at December 31, 2023 was million. The U.S. valuation allowance decreased during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 by million and million, respectively, for a total valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 of million, fully reserving the U.S. net deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized or not. A significant piece of objective evidence evaluated is the cumulative income or loss incurred over the three-year period ended September 30, 2024 and whether the Company projects a loss for the current year ending December 31, 2024. Management assesses all the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets before they otherwise expire. The Company considers projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences, carryback opportunities, and prudent tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company is in a cumulative loss position on a consolidated basis, and therefore, the Company considered this as negative evidence in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets of the U.S., even if the U.S. is not in a cumulative loss position. However, because the cumulative losses in the UK in recent periods are a significant piece of objective negative evidence that limits the Company's ability to consider certain criteria of subjective positive evidence such as projections for future growth. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets of the U.S. company is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the UK during the period in which those temporary differences are deductible. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable will be adjusted in future periods as necessary based on the reversal pattern of deferred balances and the actual taxable income in the UK and U.S. during the carryforward period, as well as any relevant new facts to be considered. In applying the statutory tax rate in the effective income tax rate reconciliation, the Company used the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of rather than the Cayman Islands zero percent rate.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of Cambium Networks Corporation Cambium , we , our , or us included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the financial statements and related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed March 15, 2024. Results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. 
 Overview 
 Cambium Networks is a global technology company that designs, develops, and manufactures fixed wireless and PON/XGSPON based broadband, Wi-Fi, and local area networking (LAN) switching infrastructure, and security gateway solutions for a wide range of applications, including broadband access, wireless backhaul, Internet of Things (IoT), public safety communications, and Wi-Fi access for commercial use cases. Our products enable service providers, enterprises, industrial organizations, and governments to deliver exceptional digital experiences and device connectivity, with compelling economics. Our ONE network platform simplifies the management of Cambium Networks' wired and wireless technologies. Our product lines fall into three broad, interrelated categories: Fixed Wireless fiber Broadband (FWB), Enterprise networking, and Subscription and Services. The FWB portfolio spans point-to-point (PTP) and point-to-multi-point (PMP) architectures over multiple standards, and frequency bands, including licensed, unlicensed, and lightly licensed spectrum, and fiber products. During 2024, both our ePMP4600 and PMP 450v platforms received FCC approval to operate in the recently released 6 GHz band in conjunction with our approved Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) service. 
 The Enterprise portfolio includes a complete range of indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi access points, indoor and hardened copper and optical based ethernet switches, and security gateway and software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) devices. During 2024, we introduced our first Wi-Fi 7 access point, the XV7-35X, which will be complemented with a broad range of indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi 7 solutions in the coming months as the industry transition occurs. 
 The Subscription and Services portfolio includes network planning and design, and cloud or on-premises network management and control solutions. The latter capability, delivered through subscription to cnMaestro X, forms the foundation of our ONE Network, a cloud-based network management architecture that allows users to remotely configure, monitor, and manage their wired and wireless network. It provides a single, centralized view of all Cambium Network devices, and real-time performance and usage data, allowing users to control and optimize network configuration and settings. Advanced services offered in conjunction with this platform include application visibility and control, which is used to optimize end-user experiences; and "Assurance" which allows network administrators the ability to rapidly troubleshoot network issues using AI-powered root cause analysis with proactive resolution, ensuring service level agreements are met and preventing client impact. The integrated security gateway and SD-WAN for small and medium businesses may also be associated with a subscription for network security services. 
 Trends impacting our business 
 The level of inventory across the industry along with macroeconomic factors such as higher interest rates, which impact private sector capital investment, and concerns about a global economic slowdown have resulted in softened demand for our products and services. We continue to see a high level of competition in our industry due to slower demand and aggressive pricing. We believe that this will continue to negatively impact revenues for the remainder of 2024. We may continue to have ongoing risks of technology shifts that could result in any increased inventory becoming obsolete before it is deployed. We also continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners to balance production to market demand. 
 Revenues from our Enterprise products are beginning to rebound over 2023 and we expect continued improvement during the remainder of 2024. Revenues in our PTP business declined due to fewer defense projects coming to fruition in North America. Revenues in our PMP business remained relatively flat from the second quarter of 2024, which is expected to continue as sales of Cambium's 6 GHz products slowly ramp, a decrease in back-log from distributors and continued economic headwinds. 
 We continue to monitor the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a potential global recession, inflationary pressures, and growing political tensions because of regional conflicts. We also believe that our customers continue to grapple with the impact of these macroeconomic factors on their businesses and future investment plans, resulting in business uncertainty and a more constrained approach to forecasts and orders. Any prolonged economic disruptions, further deterioration in the global economy or outbreaks of international hostilities could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods. 
 The impact of reverse globalization, including a more nationalistic trend globally leading to increasing government requirements for domestically produced products or limiting the sourcing of components and other products from China and elsewhere, has led us to limit our reliance on third-party manufacturers in China and move manufacturing to other locations, which could cause disruptions in 
 23 

our supply operations. Nationalistic trends are occurring in various geographies which may make it impractical for us to do business in some countries. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have made all required principal and interest payment obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement with Bank of America. We were in compliance with our monthly liquidity covenant for all measurement periods through September 30, 2024. However, as of September 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with our quarterly EBITDA covenant under our Amended Credit Agreement, and we were not in compliance with our monthly liquidity covenant as of October 31, 2024. Such defaults would afford the lenders thereunder the right to declare the amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable, and we may not be able to obtain a forbearance or waiver of the defaults or otherwise refinance such indebtedness, if required. If Bank of America were to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement, there is substantial uncertainty we would be able to secure capital resources to repay the amounts due. We are seeking a forbearance from the bank and are working with the bank to address our noncompliance with the covenant. Refer to Note 6. Debt, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 We are actively taking actions to improve our profitability and continue to focus on operating efficiency and reducing discretionary spending, deferring capital expenditures and implementing cost reductions to align our cost structure with current and expected revenue levels and sales of excess inventory. We believe these actions, together with our existing cash balances, provide us with the financial flexibility needed to meet our obligations as they come due over the next twelve months, so long as our lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement do not accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement. However, this conclusion depends in part on the bank not accelerating the maturity of our debt, our expectations regarding macro-conditions in the markets in which we compete, customer acceptance and purchases of our products, buying decisions by our distributors and other factors that are not within our control. Should Bank of America declare the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness. If Bank of America were to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement, there is substantial uncertainty we will be able to secure capital resources to repay the amounts due.

Basis of presentation 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of our products, which consist of hardware with essential embedded software. Our revenues also include amounts for software products, extended warranty on hardware products and subscription services. We generally recognize product revenues at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenues are recognized net of estimated stock returns, rebates, incentives and cooperative marketing allowances that we provide to distributors. We recognize subscription services revenue ratably over the term in which services are provided and our performance obligation is satisfied. We provide a standard warranty on our hardware products, with the term depending on the product, and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with potential warranty claims. In addition, we also offer extended warranties for purchase and represents a future performance obligation for us. The extended warranty is included in deferred revenues and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the extended warranty. 
 Cost of revenues and gross profit 
 Our cost of revenues is comprised primarily of the costs of procuring finished goods from our third-party manufacturers, third-party logistics and warehousing provider costs, freight costs and warranty costs. We outsource our manufacturing to third-party manufacturers located primarily in Mexico, Thailand, Israel and Taiwan. Cost of revenues also includes costs associated with supply operations, including personnel related costs and allocated overhead costs, provision for excess and obsolete inventory and loss on supplier commitment expense, third-party license costs and third-party costs related to services we provide. Cost of revenues also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with products marketed to be sold. 
 24 

Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including changes in product mix. The margin profile of products within each of our core product categories can vary significantly depending on the operating performance, features and manufacturer of the product. Gross margin will also vary as a function of changes in pricing due to competitive pressure, our third-party manufacturing and other production costs, cost of shipping and logistics, provision for excess and obsolete inventory and loss on supplier commitment expense and other factors. We expect our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors. 
 Operating expenses 
 We classify our operating expense as research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the primary component of each of these operating expense categories, which consist of personnel costs, such as salaries, sales commissions, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation expense. In addition, we separate depreciation and amortization in their own category. 
 Research and development 
 In addition to personnel-related costs, research and development expenses consist of costs associated with design and development of our products, product certification, travel, recruiting and shared facilities and shared IT costs. We generally recognize research and development expense as incurred. We capitalize certain software project costs under development during the period between determining technological feasibility of the product and commercial release. We amortize the capitalized development cost upon commercial release, generally over three years, and this is included in cost of revenues. We typically do not capitalize costs related to the development of first-generation product offerings as technological feasibility generally coincides with general availability of the software. 
 Sales and marketing 
 In addition to personnel-related costs for sales, marketing, service and product line management personnel, sales and marketing expenses consist of our training programs, trade shows, marketing programs, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, national and local regulatory approval on our products, travel and entertainment, recruiting, digital marketing platforms, third-party marketing services and shared facilities and shared IT costs. 
 General and administrative 
 In addition to personnel-related costs, general and administrative expenses consist of professional fees, such as legal, audit, accounting, information technology and consulting costs, insurance, shared facilities and shared IT costs, and other supporting overhead costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation related to fixed assets such as computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, and testing equipment, as well as amortization related to acquired and software for internal use and definite lived intangibles. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Management assesses our deferred tax assets in each reporting period, and if it is determined that it is not more likely than not to be realized, we will record a valuation allowance in that period.

 Our PMP product revenues decreased 5.6 million, or 23.7 , from the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 2024. The decrease in point-to-multi-point revenues was driven by lower revenues in Europe, Middle East, Africa, mostly due to lower demand, partially offset by higher revenues in North America, mostly due to higher demand. 
 Point-to-Point 
 PTP product revenues decreased 6.5 million, or 40.9 , from the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 2024 mostly driven by lower demand for defense products across all regions. 
 Enterprise 
 Enterprise product revenues increased 12.7 million, or 506.6 , from the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 2024. Enterprise revenues increased in all regions except Asia Pacific, with the largest increase in Europe, Middle East, Africa. Enterprise product revenues increased mostly for Wi-Fi 6 and switching products as channel inventory levels are decreasing and distributors are restocking.

The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily driven by a 3.9 million decrease in excess and obsolescence reserve and 0.2 million decrease in loss on supplier commitment recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. Cost of revenues also decreased due to lower freight-in costs and lower production costs. 
 Gross margin increased to 39.9 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 25.5 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects the impact from the decrease in our excess and obsolescence reserve and loss on supplier commitment expense, along with the lower freight-in and production costs.

The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to 1.6 million lower staff-related costs, mostly due to a reduction in headcount from restructuring activities, 1.0 million lower engineering materials spend and 0.8 million lower outside contractor spend due to the restructuring actions implemented in 2023 and streamlining projects and 0.6 million lower restructuring and nonrecurring fees due to restructuring activities undertaken in the third quarter of 2023 that did not repeat. 
 Sales and marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense decreased 1.3 million, or 13.2 , to 8.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 9.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to 0.6 million lower staff-related costs, mostly due to a reduction in headcount from restructuring activities in 2023 offset by new hires in 2024, 0.2 million lower share-based compensation expense, 0.2 million lower outside contractor spend, 0.2 million lower other outside services and 0.1 million lower restructuring expenses due to restructuring activities undertaken in the third quarter of 2023 that did not repeat in 2024. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased 2.5 million, or 29.2 , to 6.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 8.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to 1.5 million of nonrecurring expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Chief Executive Officer transition that did not repeat in 2024, 0.3 lower staff-related costs due to lower headcount, 0.3 million lower professional fees, 0.2 million lower audit and tax fees and 0.2 million reduction of bad debt expense.

Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly by 0.1 million from the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. This increase is mostly driven by the amortization of leasehold improvements related to the new Hoffman Estates office.

Our provision for income taxes at September 30, 2023 was based upon the estimated annual tax rate for the year, applied to federal, state and foreign income. Due to forecasting uncertainty for 2024, our provision for income taxes at September 30, 2024 is based on 9-month year-to-date actual results. Our provision for income taxes was 0.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 versus a provision for income taxes of 3.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rates were (2.2) and (15.0) over the same periods, respectively. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate of (15.0) was different from the statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets on the UK company, net of tax benefits on Foreign Derived Intangible Income, tax benefit arising on U.S. Research and Development tax credits, and changes to the excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate of (2.2) was different from the statutory rate of 21.0 , primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of the UK company, maintaining a full valuation allowance on the net UK deferred tax assets.

The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to decreased revenues, but was offset by 9.3 million provision for excess and obsolescence recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a 3.2 million increase from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and 6.4 million loss on supplier commitment recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a 4.3 million increase from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, and higher amortization of capitalized software costs. The increase in the excess and obsolescence reserve was mostly due to a decrease in lifetime demand of certain products, and the increase in the loss on supplier commitment expense was mostly due to decreased demand for fiber and switching components. 
 Gross margin decreased to 30.7 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 44.4 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects the impact from an increase in our excess and obsolescence reserve, increase in loss on supplier commitments, lower revenues from higher margin products and fixed services and subscription costs.

The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to 1.5 million of nonrecurring expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Chief Executive Officer that did not repeat in 2024 and 0.3 million lower corporate bonus expense as 2023 included amounts for guaranteed bonuses, partially offset by 0.3 million higher legal fees. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly by 0.4 million from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate of (15.3) was different from the statutory rate of 21.0 , primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of the UK company, net of tax benefits on Foreign Derived Intangible Income, tax benefit arising on U.S. Research and Development tax credits, and changes to the excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate of (1.0) was different from the statutory rate of 21.0 , primarily due to the implementation of a tax method change in the U.S. related to the tax capitalization of our research and development expenditures, resulting in a provision-to-return impact, and a corresponding reduction in the required U.S. valuation allowance, while also including in the period an increase in the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of the UK company, maintaining a full valuation allowance on the net UK deferred tax assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 46.5 million, an increase of 27.8 million from December 31, 2023. We drew 45.0 million on our revolving credit facility in the first half of 2024 for working capital needs for the near future, mainly to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) fund capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall economic conditions. We continue to focus on cost management, operating efficiency and efficient discretionary spending. We expect to regularly assess our liquidity needs and market conditions and may raise additional equity or incur additional debt if and when our board of directors determines that doing so is in our best interest. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, all quarterly principal and interest payments have been made in accordance with the terms of our credit facility with Bank of America. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our monthly liquidity covenant for all measurement periods, but were not in compliance with our quarterly EBITDA covenant under the credit agreement. In addition, we were not in compliance with our monthly liquidity covenant as of October 31, 2024. Such defaults would afford Bank of America the right to declare the amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable. We are seeking a forbearance from the bank and are working with the bank to address our noncompliance with the covenant. If we are not able to obtain a forbearance or waiver of the defaults or otherwise refinance such indebtedness, and if Bank of America were to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement, there is substantial uncertainty we would be able to secure capital resources to repay the amounts due. Please refer to Note 6. Debt in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, regarding our debt outstanding under our credit facilities.

Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 10.7 million consisted of net loss of 24.6 million, share-based compensation expense of 8.8 million and adjustments for depreciation and amortization and other non-cash impacts of 12.5 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of 0.3 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in net cash outflows of 7.71 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a 28.3 million increase in inventories due to lower demand for our products and higher channel inventory, a 6.5 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of invoices and payments, a 2.0 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due to lower corporate bonus accrual and 1.3 million lower accrued liabilities primarily related to lower inventory in transit. The uses of cash were partially offset by a 22.4 million decrease in accounts receivable reflecting the impact of lower sales and the timing of collections, 4.8 million increase in cash provided by all other assets and liabilities, mostly driven by the increase in accrued sales returns along with collection of the UK RDEC tax credit and 3.0 million reduction in prepaid expenses, mostly due to lower vendor prepayments. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 of 4.3 million consisted primarily of net loss of 45.3 million, offset by an increase in our provision for inventory excess and obsolescence of 9.3 million, share-based compensation expense of 7.6 million and adjustments for depreciation and amortization and other non-cash impacts of 8.4 million, a decrease in deferred tax assets of 3.7 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in net cash inflows of 11.9 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a 14.6 million decrease in inventories, 3.8 million decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales and improved cash collection, 2.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities and 1.7 million decrease in accounts payable due to decreased purchases. These inflows were partially offset by 9.3 million increase in prepaid expenses, mostly as a result of an increase in supplier prepayments and a 1.1 million decrease in employee compensation. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Our investing activities for all periods presented consisted of capital expenditures for property, equipment, internal use software and capitalized labor costs for software to be marketed for sale in support of the growth of our business. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is mostly due to leasehold improvements completed on the new Hoffman Estates headquarters. 
 33 

Cash flows from financing activities 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of 1.0 million was primarily due to 2.0 million repayment of principal due under the term loan facility with Bank of America and 0.7 million for taxes paid from shares withheld in net settlement of taxes due on vesting of restricted shares issued to our employees partially offset by proceeds received of 1.1 million from the issuance of ordinary shares under our ESPP and 0.5 million from the exercise of share options. 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 43.0 million was primarily due to 45.0 million drawn down on the revolving credit facility and proceeds received of 0.7 million from the issuance of ordinary shares under our ESPP partially offset by 2.6 million repayment of principal due under the term loan facility with Bank of America. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 22.8 million outstanding on our term loan facility and 45.0 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility with Bank of America. The effective interest rate on the term credit facility at September 30, 2024 was 8.85 and the weighted-average interest rate on our revolving credit facility was 8.66 . The Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 0.7 million under the term credit facility and quarterly interest payments under both the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility. For the third quarter of 2024, all quarterly principal and interest payments have been made in accordance with the terms of our credit agreement with Bank of America. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our monthly liquidity covenant for all measurement periods, but were not in compliance with our quarterly EBITDA covenant under this credit agreement. In addition, we were not in compliance with our monthly liquidity covenant as of October 31, 2024. Such defaults would afford Bank of America the right to declare the amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable. We are seeking a forbearance from the bank and are working with the bank to address our noncompliance with the covenant. If we are not able to obtain a forbearance or waiver of the defaults or otherwise refinance such indebtedness, and if Bank of America were to accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement, there is substantial uncertainty we would be able to secure capital resources to repay the amounts due. Absent acceleration of payment, our term loan facility and revolving credit facility matures on November 17, 2026, at which time the outstanding principal will be due. Refer to Note 6. Debt, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the only material change to the contractual obligations and commercial commitments from what was disclosed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 is the addition of 45.0 million in long-term debt related to the drawdown of funds against our revolving credit facility. The 45.0 million was drawn down in three draws, the first draw of 10.0 million in February 2024, the second draw of 30.0 million in March 2024 and the third draw of 5.0 million in April 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility is 8.66 . Interest is due and payable quarterly. The revolving credit facility matures on November 17, 2026, absent acceleration, at which time the outstanding principal will be due. Based on the interest rate at the time of the draw and assuming no acceleration of the repayment of principal until maturity, this increases our obligations by 3.1 million for interest in 2024, 4.0 million for interest in 2025 and 45.0 million for principal and 3.5 million for interest in 2026. 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 We do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as variable interest entities, structured finance, or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks. 
 Significant Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expense and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.

Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 15, 2024, for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Since the filing of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting estimates from those disclosed therein, except as described below: 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we concluded that a goodwill impairment triggering event had occurred primarily due to a debt covenant breach and a sustained decline in the trading price of our shares. Additional factors that contributed to this conclusion included current macroeconomic trends and uncertainty surrounding inflation and high interest rates, which negatively impact disposable income, spending and overall consumer confidence, all of which have and may continue to adversely impact our sales, results of operations and cash flows. These factors are applicable to our one reporting unit which resulted in us performing quantitative goodwill impairment testing of that reporting unit. We considered whether these events and circumstances would affect any other assets and concluded to perform quantitative impairment testing on our long-lived assets, which included our definite-lived customer relationships. 
 Goodwill impairment assessment 
 We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on December 31 of each year, or more frequently should circumstances change or events occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
 As indicated in Note 5. Goodwill and intangible assets, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we concluded that a goodwill impairment triggering event had occurred, and our qualitative assessment resulted in us performing quantitative impairment testing on our one reporting unit. 
 For the assessment of goodwill impairment, management determined it operates as one reporting unit and compared the fair value of its one reporting unit to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of its one reporting unit, we used both an income and market approach. The income approach, or discounted cash flow method, utilized our current forecast based on management's estimates of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and working capital projections. Our internal forecasts and strategic long-range plans take into consideration historical and recent business results, industry trends and macroeconomic factors that impact the markets we serve. The residual value was captured utilizing the Gordon Growth method and the discount rate was determined based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital utilizing market data of our peer group companies. The market approach used was the Guideline Public Company ("GPC") method which valued the Company based on trading multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are similar to the Company. The trailing-twelve-month, 2024 estimate and 2025 estimate enterprise value-to-revenue multiples were used to value the Company. Multiples were selected based on a review of the multiple indications derived from the GPCs and the comparable company multiples were reviewed for differences in growth prospects, profitability and risk profiles between the Company and the GPCs. 
 Based on the results of the quantitative assessments, the fair value of the Company's one reporting unit was higher than its carrying value and the Company's goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2024. 
 Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate expected future cash flows, including evaluating the impact of operational and economic factors on our future cash flows, all of which are subject to uncertainty. The assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of our reporting unit involves significant elements of subjective judgment and analysis by management. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in actual and expected demand, among others, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A revision of these estimates and assumptions could cause the fair value of our one reporting unit to fall below its carrying value, which could result in a material non-cash impairment to our goodwill in a future period. 
 Long-lived assets recoverability assessment 
 We also performed a recoverability test of our long-lived assets in conjunction with the goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30, 2024 which did not result in any impairment charges. Changes in market conditions, operating performance and other similar circumstances could affect the assumptions used in this test, which could result in impairment charges that could be material in a future period. For additional information, see Note 5. Goodwill and intangible assets, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Excluding the impact of changes in interest rates and the uncertainty in the global financial markets, there have been no material changes to our market risk for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. We conduct business in all parts of the world and are thereby exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is the single largest currency in which our revenue contracts are denominated. Any decline in the value of local foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar results in our products and services being more expensive to a potential foreign customer. In those instances where our goods and services have already been sold, receivables may be more difficult to collect. Additionally, in jurisdictions where the revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local currency, any decline in the value of the U.S. dollar will have an unfavorable impact to operating margins. We have not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or arbitrage. 
 We do not hold any cash in any investment accounts and all cash is deposited with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. The Company's cash consists primarily of U.S. dollar denominated demand accounts. 
 We had 22.8 million outstanding on our term loan facility and 45.0 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 under our credit agreement with Bank of America. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from fluctuations in the Term SOFR that is a component of the interest rate used to calculate interest expense on both the term and revolving credit facilities. Interest accrues on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility and revolving credit facility at a rate equal to the selected rate per annum determined by reference to the 1-month, 3-month or 6-month Term SOFR rate as selected by the Company, plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 , plus an applicable margin of 3.25 . At September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the term loan was 8.85 . A hypothetical 100-basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional 0.2 million in interest expense related to the term credit facility per year. At September 30, 2024, the weighted-average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 8.66 . A hypothetical 100-basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional 0.5 million in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility per year. 
 There have been no other material changes in our market risk since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, previously reported in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as described below during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Material Weaknesses 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023: 
 Management concluded that our control environment was ineffective in identifying changes in risk and designing internal controls that are responsive to risks. As a result, certain process-level controls related to the determination of our inventory excess and obsolescence reserve and recoverability of deferred tax assets were not designed effectively in that they were not designed to appropriately evaluate methodology and assumptions, operate with a sufficient level of precision, nor adequately address information utilized in the performance of the controls. 
 The control deficiencies resulted in material errors to our inventory excess and obsolescence reserve and deferred tax asset valuation allowance that have been corrected in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Furthermore, the control deficiencies described above created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, we concluded that the deficiencies represent 
 36 

material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 In addition, management identified the following material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024: 
 Management concluded that we did not have sufficient resources with the appropriate technical accounting expertise to be able to assist us in identifying, evaluating and addressing complex technical accounting issues that affect our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. 
 This control deficiency resulted in an initial failure to correctly classify debt as of September 30, 2024. This control deficiency also resulted in an initial failure to identify impairment triggering events in our long-lived assets and goodwill as of September 30, 2024. By not taking these impairment triggering events into consideration, the Company could have failed to recognize whether an asset group or reporting unit was impaired in accordance with ASC 360-10 and ASC 350-10, respectively. We reclassified 20.2 million of the term loan facility, 0.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the term loan facility and 45.0 million of the revolving credit facility from Long-term debt, net to Current portion of long-term debt, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We also reclassified 0.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility from Other noncurrent assets to Other current assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. No impairments were identified following the quantitative impairment testing on our long-lived assets and goodwill as of September 30, 2024. 
 Management has determined that the identified deficiency is related to employee turnover and insufficient internal resources in technical accounting and financial reporting impacting the control environment in the third quarter of 2024, and, therefore, relates to the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and does not affect previously reported periods. The control deficiency described above created a reasonable probability that a material misstatement to the condensed consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, we concluded that the deficiency represents a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Ongoing Remediation Efforts to Address the Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
 Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, is taking steps to remediate the control deficiencies which resulted in the material weaknesses described above by implementing changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Management is in the process of enhancing, and will continue to enhance, the risk assessment process and design and implementation of internal controls over financial reporting. The remediation measures to correct the previously identified material weaknesses include enhancing the design and implementation of existing controls and creating new controls as needed to address identified risks, adding personnel and providing additional training to personnel including the appropriate level of documentation to be maintained to support internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, we intend to enhance our technical accounting expertise within the Company to better identify and address complex technical accounting issues as they arise. 
 As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to strengthen controls or to modify the remediation plan described above. When fully implemented and operational, we believe the controls we have designed or plan to design will remediate the control deficiency that has led to the material weaknesses that we have identified. The previously identified material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in internal control 
 We continue working towards implementing processes and procedures to address the material weaknesses noted above. Other than changes in personnel, including the previously announced departure of our Chief Accounting Officer, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 
 None.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Shareholder lawsuit 
 On May 22, 2024, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Hamby v. Cambium Networks Corporation et al, Case No. 1:24-cv-04240) against us and three of our current or former officers. The complaint purports to assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, on behalf of persons and entities who acquired our ordinary shares between May 8, 2023 and January 18, 2024, or the Class Period. The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the Company and certain of its executive officers made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about its business, operations, and prospects in violation of Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount. On July 22, 2024, motions were filed on behalf of purported class member shareholders seeking to serve as lead plaintiff. On October 21, 2024, the court approved the appointment of lead plaintiff; an amended complaint is expected to be filed by December 4, 2024. This litigation is in its early stages and the Company cannot currently estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, that it may experience in connection with this claim. 
 Other claims 
 Third parties may from time to time assert legal claims against us. Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. A number of companies hold a large number of patents that may cover technology necessary to our products. We have in the past received and expect to continue to receive claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights. In the opinion of management, we believe we have established adequate accruals pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for any expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based on presently available information. However, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions, or cash flows. 
 For additional information, see Note 11 Commitments and contingencies in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 except as discussed below. Additional risk and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 If the Company is required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company s financial condition and results would be negatively affected. 
 The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group below its carrying amount and tests intangible assets if an indicator suggests that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company completes a quarterly qualitative triggering events assessment which considers significant events and circumstances such as a reporting unit s historical and current results, assumptions regarding future performance, operating income or cash flows, strategic initiatives and overall economic factors, including significant negative industry or economic trends and macro-economic developments, and sustained declines in the Company's share price or market capitalization, considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers, to determine whether any of these may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company engaged a third party valuation firm to provide an interim goodwill impairment valuation as of September 30, 2024 as a result of triggering events identified during the third quarter relating to the decline in the trading price of our shares as well as the failure to satisfy the financial covenants under our Amended Credit Agreement. Although the Company determined that as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our one reporting unit remained higher than its carrying value and our goodwill is not impaired, any additional declines in the trading price of our shares, if we are unable to reach agreement with the lender under the Amended Credit Agreement in connection with our failure to meet financial covenants, or if the outlook for our business deteriorates or other negative business factors exist, we may be required to perform another goodwill 
 38 

impairment analysis in future periods, which could result in an impairment of up to the entire balance of our goodwill or result in the carrying value of our long-lived assets no longer being greater than our undiscounted cash flows. These actions would adversely impact our financial results and results of operations. 
 We are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. 
 On May 22, 2024, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Hamby v. Cambium Networks Corporation et al, Case No. 1:24-cv-04240) against us and three of our current or former officers. The complaint purports to assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, on behalf of persons and entities who acquired our ordinary shares between May 8, 2023 and January 18, 2024, or the Class Period. The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the Company and certain of its executive officers made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about its business, operations, and prospects in violation of Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. 
 We have been and continue to risk being unable to meet our financial covenants under our credit facilities, which may result in doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 We are subject to compliance with financial covenants under our credit facilities with Bank of America. We did not meet our quarterly EBITDA covenant as of September 30, 2024, nor our monthly liquidity covenant as of October 31, 2024, and there is uncertainty as to our ability to continue to meet the financial covenants in future periods. We are seeking a forbearance from Bank of America, as lender under the Amended Credit Agreement, and are working with the bank to address our noncompliance with these covenants. If the bank is unwilling to come to an acceptable resolution of these non-payment defaults, the lenders under our credit facilities could declare the amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable, and we may not be able to obtain a waiver of such a default or otherwise pay or refinance the indebtedness. Should we be unable to obtain a waiver or otherwise refinance our indebtedness, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 We are actively taking actions to improve our profitability to work with the bank to resolve our non-payment defaults under the credit facilities. These actions include deferral of expenditures, and cost reductions to align our cost structure with current revenue levels. In addition, we continue to focus on operating efficiency and reducing discretionary spending. Any of these measures may have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, fund research and development initiatives, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated financial requirements. The ultimate success of any such actions in sustaining our ability to continue as a going concern cannot be assured. 
 If we do not meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, we could be subject to a delisting of our common stock. 
 If we are unable to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market, including the requirement that we meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), we could be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If our share price drops below 1.00 per share for a period of 30 calendar days, we may receive a notice of delisting from Nasdaq. We expect that any notice from Nasdaq would provide us with a compliance period of at least 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance, including possible extension of further days to regain compliance if it appears to Nasdaq that we will be able to cure the deficiency. To date, our share price has not dropped below 1.00 per share.
