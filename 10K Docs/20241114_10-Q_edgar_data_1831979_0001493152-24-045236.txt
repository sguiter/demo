Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain
statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the federal
securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our and our management team s
expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections,
forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, 
 intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, 
 project, should, will, would, and similar expressions may identify forward-looking
statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are
provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as and must not be relied on by any investor as guarantees,
assurances, predictions, or definitive statements of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible
to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Stardust Power Inc. (the
 Company or Stardust Power ). Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include,
for example, statements about: 

risks
 relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information with respect to the Company; 

failure
 to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination; 

the
 ability to maintain the listing of the Common Stock and the Public Warrants on the Nasdaq; 

the
 Company s ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, to obtain debt financing, or refinance existing indebtedness
 on satisfactory terms, or otherwise raise financing in the future; 

the
 liquidity and trading of the Common Stock and the Public Warrants; 

members
 of the Company s management team allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with
 the Company s business; 

the
 Company s future financial performance; 

the
 Company s success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, its officers, key employees, or directors; 

the
 Company s ability to manage future growth; 

the
 Company s ability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner, and make enhancements to its
 business; 

the
 effects of competition on the Company s business; 

market
 demand for and uses of lithium-based end products; 

changes
 in domestic and foreign business, financial, political, and legal conditions; 

future
 global, regional, or local economic and market conditions; 

the
 outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, and inquiries; 

the
 development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; and 

the
 Company s other plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions described or referenced in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
 under the heading Risk Factors, and other documents that the Company will file, from time to time with the Securities
 Exchange Commission SEC ). 

If
any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by
these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial
that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 

In
addition, forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, plans, or forecasts of future events and views as of the date hereof.
We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our assessments to change. However, while we may elect to update these
forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so except as otherwise required
by applicable law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our assessment as of any date subsequent
to the date hereof. 

These
statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. As a result of a number of
known and unknown risks and uncertainties, actual results or our performance of the Company may be materially different from those expressed
or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in and have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We
qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

On
October 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a related Registration
Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC B. Riley Principal
Capital II ). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company
will have the right, in its sole discretion, to sell up to 
 of newly issued shares of the Company s
Common Stock to B. Riley Principal Capital II, subject to certain conditions and limitations contained in the Purchase Agreement,
from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement. Sales of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and the timing
of any sales, are solely at the option of the Company. No sales of shares of Common Stock have taken place under the Purchase Agreement as of the date on which these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. 

As
of the date on which these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, we believe that the
cash on hand, and additional investments available through issuance of new Common Stock, will be inadequate to satisfy the Company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least
the next twelve months. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management s plan to raise additional
capital from issuance of equity or receive additional borrowings to fund the Company s operating and investing activities over the
next year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

the Closing Date and ending on the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date. There are no service conditions or any requirement for
the participants to provide goods or services in order to vest in the Merger Earnout Shares. Accordingly, we determined that the
Merger Earnout Shares are not within the scope of ASC 718. Further, since the Merger Earnout Shares represent a freestanding
equity-linked financial instrument, we evaluated the requirements of ASC 480 and concluded that the Merger Earnout Shares should not
be classified as a liability and instead is a financial instrument within the scope of ASC 815. 

The
Merger Earnout Share arrangement contains two exercise contingencies the daily volume weighted average stock price and a
change of control neither of which is based on an observable market or an observable index other than one based on the
Company s stock. Further, with respect to settlement provisions, we noted that no provisions impact the fixed number of shares to be issued upon settlement, except for adjustments for standard anti-dilutive provisions. Furthermore, the equity classification
conditions in ASC 815-40-25 are also met. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 815-40, the Earnout Shares are indexed to the Common
Stock and are accordingly classified as equity. As the merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, the fair value of the
Earnout Share arrangement as of the merger date, amounting to has
been accounted for as an equity transaction (as a deemed dividend) as of the closing date of the merger.

Dividend yield 

Due
to the absence of an active market for the Company s Common Stock at the time of the grant, the Company utilized methodologies in accordance with the
framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid (Valuation of Privately Held Company
Equity Securities Issued as Compensation) to estimate the fair value of its Common Stock. In determining the exercise prices for
options granted, the Company has considered the estimated fair value of the Common Stock as at the grant date. The estimated fair
value of the Common Stock has been determined at each grant date based upon a variety of factors, including the business, financial
condition and results of operations, economic and industry trends, the illiquid nature of the Common Stock, the market performance
of peer group of similar publicly traded companies, and future business plans of the Company. Significant changes to the key
assumptions underlying the factors used could result in different fair values of Common Stock at each valuation date. 

The
Company based the risk-free interest rate on a U.S. Treasury Bond Yield with a term substantially equal to the option s expected
term. 

The
Company based the expected volatility on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from price of publicly traded
shares of peer group of similar companies. 

The
expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term for option grants is
determined using the simplified method which represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted average
vesting period of the option. The Company considers this appropriate as there is not sufficient historical information available to
develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. 

Restricted
Stock Units 

During
April and June 2024, Legacy Stardust Power granted 
restricted stock units 2023 Plan RSUs to employees under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. These 2023 Plan RSUs are
subject to a service-based vesting requirement, and a liquidity plus service-based vesting requirement, which is defined as
completion of a go public transaction or change in control. In order for any shares to vest, both the service-based vesting
requirement and the liquidity plus service-based vesting requirement must be satisfied with respect to such shares. The liquidity
conditions were met on July 8, 2024 upon consummation of the Business Combination, and therefore compensation expenses related to these awards began to be recognized in the quarter ended September
30, 2024 using a graded vesting method over the requisite service period.

2024
Equity Incentive Plan 

The
Board adopted, and the stockholders of the Company approved, the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan in September 2024. The maximum number of shares with respect to one or more awards that may be granted to any one participant during any calendar
year shall be 
shares of Common Stock. The 2024 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, RSUs, PSUs share appreciation
rights, restricted shares, dividend equivalents, substitute awards, and other share or cash-based awards (such as cash bonus awards
and performance awards) for issuance to employees or consultants of the Company (or any of the Company s parents or
subsidiaries), or directors of the Company. 

On
September 16, 2024, the Company granted (a) 
 RSUs to independent directors, officers, employees
and consultants which are subject to a service based vesting requirement, (b) 
 RSUs fully vested as of the date of grant to
consultants and (c) 
PSUs to employees with a service and market condition. These PSUs cliff vest at the end of a three-year term subject to share
price based market condition (i.e., the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock is greater than or equal to 
 per share for a period of 20 trading days in any 30
trading day period or there is a change of control, or the PSUs are otherwise forfeited). The compensation expense for these RSUs and
PSUs were recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the award. 

Given the absence of a public trading market prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the Legacy Stardust
Power board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of its common stock at each
grant date. These factors included, but were not limited to: (i) independent contemporaneous third-party valuations of common stock; (ii)
the prices for the Company s convertible notes sold to outside investors; (iii) the rights and preferences of convertible preferred
stock relative to common stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of its common stock; (v) developments in the business; and (vi) the likelihood
of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO, given prevailing market conditions. Subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination,
the fair value of common stock is based on the closing price of the Company s common stock, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select
Market on the date of grant.

The
Company s warrants are not indexed to the Company s Common Stock in the manner contemplated by ASC Section 815-40-15

option to call for additional preferred stock up to based
on the contingent event of SAFE note conversion and notice issued by the Board, and achievement of certain milestones, for up to 42
months following such conversion. This feature was determined to be an embedded feature and is valued as part of the liability value

Company
Overview and History 

On
December 5, 2022, Stardust Power LLC was organized as a limited liability company in the State of Delaware. On March 16, 2023,
Stardust Power Operating Inc. (f/k/a Stardust Power Inc. prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, Legacy Stardust Power was organized as a corporation in the State of Delaware with
operations commencing on March 16, 2023. The ownership interests of Stardust Power LLC were subsequently transferred to Stardust
Power Inc. On July 8, 2024, former Stardust Power Inc. was renamed Stardust Power Operating Inc. 

Stardust
Power is a U.S.-based development stage battery grade lithium manufacturer designed to foster clean energy independence for America.
The Company is in the process of creating capacity to manufacture battery grade lithium products, primarily for the electric vehicle EV market, by developing a large-scale lithium refinery in the United States. Stardust Power seeks to become a sustainable, cost-effective
supplier of battery grade lithium products, by its innovative approach in the development of a large central refinery optimized for multiple
inputs of lithium brine inputs (the Facility in Oklahoma. 

Stardust
Power intends to source lithium brine feedstock from various suppliers and may make investments upstream to secure additional feedstock.
We seek to sell our products to EV manufacturers as our primary market, with potential applications in other areas such as battery manufacturers,
the U.S. military, and original equipment manufacturers OEMs . 

Some
of the key driving factors are the demand for battery grade lithium products, fueled largely by the demand and production of electric
vehicles and automotive OEMs and battery manufacturers seeking domestic supply options, leading to demand for minerals used in battery
cells, such as lithium, governmental incentives for American manufacturing and evolving geopolitical climate that is creating a national
security priority for the U.S. market. 

In
February 2023, Stardust Power LLC received an illustrative incentive analysis for up to 257 million in performance-based incentives
from the State of Oklahoma and potential federal incentives, which also contained potential for further eligible
federal grants. The state incentives were based on initial job creation, equipment procurement, training and recruitment incentives,
property tax exemptions, sales tax exemptions, and capital expenditure projections submitted to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce in
the first quarter of 2023 and could be subject to changes as the Company would progress in setting up the Facility and commercial production of battery
grade lithium in the future. These incentives may change based on the actual financial metrics of the Company in the future, which may
be lower or higher. 

19 

Stardust
Power believes that it is well poised to address these opportunities by emerging as a leading, fully integrated domestic lithium supplier,
and contribute to restoring American sustainable energy independence, thereby bridging the gap in the domestic supply of battery grade
lithium products.

Investment
in QX Resources

a limited liability company whose ordinary shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, for 200,000. This investment in
the ordinary shares of QXR has been made for strategic purposes and specifically with an intention to gain access for conducting
feasibility studies for the production of lithium products from the lithium brine surface anomaly identified over the 102 square-kilometer
Liberty Lithium Brine Project in SaltFire Flat, California (the Project ), for which QXR has a binding option to
purchase agreement and operating agreement to earn a 75 interest from IG Lithium LLC (the Earn-in Venture ).
Legacy Stardust Power is not a direct party to the Earn-in Venture and accordingly has no direct or indirect economic or controlling interest either
in the Project or in any of the associated rights originating from the Earn-in Venture held by QXR. No formal off-take agreement
has been executed as of September 30, 2024. Further, no material expenses have been incurred towards the feasibility studies during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company neither has a controlling financial interest nor does it exercise significant
influence over QXR. Accordingly, the investment in QXR s ordinary shares does not result in either the consolidation
or application of equity method of accounting for the Company.

Key
Factors Affecting Our Performance 

We
believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also
pose risks and challenges, including competition from other lithium brine and other brine producers, changes to existing federal and
state level incentive framework, changes in regulations, and other factors discussed under the section titled Risk Factors 
in our Prospectus and this Quarterly Report. We believe the factors described below are key to our success. 

Commencing
Commercial Operations 

We
are a development stage company, and have executed a purchase and sale agreement, effective
January 10, 2024, with the City of Muskogee. The critical issue analysis, phase I ESA, geotechnical study, and readiness assessment of the site in
Southside Industrial Park, Muskogee, Oklahoma has been
conducted, while the feasibility study for construction of an electrical substation is underway, and we may be required to conduct other
relevant studies. 

Stardust
Power is developing a large central refinery in a phased approach. The first phase is the construction of a production line with up to
25,000 tons per annum tpa ). The second phase is to add a second production line with up to 25,000 tpa, to create a total
capacity of up to 50,000 tpa. 

A
technological innovation of Stardust Power s planned refinery is the ability for the Facility to refine different sources of lithium
brine inputs. The Facility is being designed to accept lithium brines, of a certain approved chemical composition. It is Stardust Power s
intention that the Facility will be able to dilute and pretreat feedstock as necessary, to ensure that various lithium feedstock can
be blended, in order to produce a consistent feedstock. Stardust Power s strategy is to differentiate itself by screening for a
broader set of contaminants, in comparison to other lithium refineries. 

Partnership
Ecosystem 

Our
success will depend on whether we can execute and expand our ecosystem of commercial arrangements with additional suppliers of brine
and executing agreements with them at favorable terms. The availability of brine for the purpose of extracting lithium is still in a
nascent stage and we would require access to multiple sources as we start commercial production and grow our business. Our
management team frequently evaluates current and future sources of supplies for reliability of supply and geographic locations for
logistics and cost efficiency. We would also require to maintain technology arrangements with existing strategic affiliations on
whose patented and proprietary processes we depend on, as well as forge new technology affiliations as exploration, extraction and
purification processes evolve, to obtain raw materials required to manufacture high-quality lithium suitable for consumption by the
EV industry, and other potential usages. These affiliations will enable us to refine and sell battery grade lithium at competitive
prices, which in turn helps secure the growth and profitability of our business operations in the long term. 

Adequate
Capital Raise 

The
success of our refinery s activities relating to producing battery grade lithium from brine and the success of our ability to
obtain relevant permits in a timely manner require significant capital investment and financing to fund the initial investment in
all aspects of setting up the operations, and may subsequently be impacted by our operating losses, competition from substitute
products and services from larger companies, protection of proprietary technology of our strategic partners, and dependence on key
individuals. 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not
earned any revenue and has been operating at a loss since inception. The Company has an accumulated deficit and stockholders 
deficit. We believe that the cash on hand and additional investments available through issuance of new Common Stock will be
inadequate to satisfy the Company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As a development stage company, Stardust Power needs to raise additional
capital to realize its business objectives. Our long-term success and ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to successfully raise additional capital or financing, or successfully enter into strategic partnerships. Until commercial
production is achieved from our planned operations, we will continue to incur operating and investing net cash outflows associated
with, among other things, maintaining and acquiring exploration properties and undertaking ongoing exploration
activities. 

22 

Limited
Operating History 

We
have a limited operating history and there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our
performance. Our business and financial condition must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and
difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operation. As Legacy Stardust Power was incorporated
on March 16, 2023 (inception date), the period from March 16, 2023 to September 30, 2023 is not comparable to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Key
Business Metrics, Non-GAAP Measure 

Since
we have yet to start the construction of our Facility and associated commercial production, we do not have financial information on key
business metrics. However, based on our experience and industry knowledge, we expect the following would be key business metrics: 

Raw
 Material Cost/ton : This includes the input cost of lithium chloride for the plant. As this may be obtained from various sources,
 the weighted average cost will be calculated to arrive at the raw material cost per ton and reflects the Company s ability
 to procure high-quality raw materials at an appropriate price. The weighted average method also helps in calculating the gross margin
 on a per-ton basis. The technology implemented and the efficiency of the operations are also reflected on the gross margin per ton.

Selling
 Price/ton : This multiple is driven by the demand and supply of the lithium price as well as the efficient operations of the
 plant. The computation of the selling price may be based on the output sold per long-term contract, which is expected to have a floor
 and a cap, as well as the spot price on the date of placing a purchase order by the customer, with the Company and the customer sharing
 the difference between the floor and spot price. 

Capex/ton :
 This reflects the Capex incurred on a per-ton basis. It includes both direct and indirect costs. It also has contingency costs built
 in for any impact on Capex, to account for unforeseen events. The key is to optimize plant efficiency in long-term operations with
 the appropriate technology and set-up. 

Opex/ton :
 This includes the ongoing expenses incurred from the day-to-day running of the operations. It helps in measuring how much profit
 a company makes on a dollar of sales after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying
 interest or tax. The lower multiple reflects the efficient functioning of the management. 

Capacity
 Utilization : This measures how much output a plant is producing, compared to its maximum potential output, which is dependent
 on two key factors: (a) design capacity, which impacts the operational efficiency of the plant, and (b) the plant s downtime
 for its maintenance. Timely maintenance is also the key to running any efficient operations. 

Further,
since we are yet to generate revenue, non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and EBITDA margins, cannot be captured currently, but will be
stated once we have commenced commercial production and selling of battery grade lithium to our intended customers. 

23 

Business
and Macroeconomic Conditions 

Our
business and financial condition has been, and we believe will continue to be, impacted by adverse and uncertain macroeconomic conditions
and events, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain and logistics challenges, banking crises, and fluctuations
or volatility in capital markets. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue

We
have not generated any revenue to date. We expect to generate a significant portion of our future revenue from the sale of battery
grade lithium primarily to the EV market. We expect that we will enter into long-term contracts (typically 10 years), driven by
industry dynamics of the EV industry, with a pricing structure at cap and ceiling, and sharing of variable price between customers
and the Company. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

We
have not sourced any raw material to date. We expect to source brine from lithium producing suppliers including the oil and gas industry
as a byproduct of their exploration and extraction processes. We are in the process of negotiating with multiple suppliers for brine feedstock,
including producers from the oil and gas industry. The length, tenure and pricing of these contracts will depend largely on the type
of supply and is expected to vary from supplier to supplier. 

Expenses

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expense consists of costs to maintain our daily operations and administer the business that are not directly
attributable to generating revenue or cost of goods or raw material. These consist primarily of consulting services (including
advisory services for organization setup and administrative related services from contractors, consultants), professional services
such as accounting advisory, statutory auditor fees, technical consultants, and business consulting, as well as personnel related
expenses (including stock based compensation), legal and book-keeping services, insurance expenses (including director and
officer s insurance), investor relations activities and marketing expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses
will increase in absolute dollars over time as we continue to invest in initially setting up our Facility, recruit more employees,
and subsequently in the growth of our business and incur costs associated with being a publicly traded company with respect to
compliance with the regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Interest
income 

Interest
income is comprised of interest earned on promissory notes issued during the current quarter. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued promissory notes of
 176,000 and 316,000 to IGX Minerals LLC and IG Lithium LLC respectively. These notes carry an interest rate of 6 with maturity date
of December 16, 2024 and July 1, 2025, respectively. 

Interest
expense 

Interest
expense is comprised of interest payable on short-term loans. The Company entered into a financing agreement of 465,838 for the purchase
of a D O insurance policy with AFCO Insurance Premium Finance. The debt is payable in monthly installments of 44,162 per month for
11 months. Payments include a stated interest rate of 8.46 and are secured against a lien on the insurance policy. 

24 

Interest
expense prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2024 comprised of interest payable on short-term loans. Legacy Stardust Power entered into a
financing agreement of 80,800 for the purchase of an insurance policy with First Insurance Funding. Payments include a stated
interest rate of 8.25 and are secured against a lien on the insurance policy. The debt was fully paid off as at September 30,
2024. 

Change
in fair value of investment in equity securities 

Change
in fair value of investment in equity securities relates to movements in fair value of investment in equity securities of strategic investments
such as the investment in QX Resources, that need to be recorded in the statement of operations for each reporting period, based on readily
available quoted prices for such investment. 

Change
in fair value of SAFE notes and convertible notes 

Change in fair value of SAFE notes and convertible notes relates to movements in fair value of SAFE notes and convertible notes that have been
classified as liability instruments in the financial statements, which need to be recorded in the statement of operations for each
reporting period, based on third party valuations carried out at period end. Upon consummation of the Business Combination on July
8, 2024, the SAFE notes and convertible notes were converted into Common Stock of the Company. 

Change
in fair value of earnout shares 

Change
in fair value of earnout shares relates to movements in fair value of earnout shares issued to the Sponsor which have been classified
as liability instruments in the financial statements, that need to be recorded in the statement of operations for each reporting period,
based on third party valuations carried out at period end. 

Change
in fair value of warrants 

Change
in fair value of warrants relates to movements in fair value of Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants which have been classified as liability
instruments in the financial statements, that need to be recorded in the statement of operations for each reporting period, based on
fair value at period end. 

Provision
for income taxes 

We
are constituted as a Delaware corporation and are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates, as adjusted for allowable
credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax law.

to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Revenues

We
did not earn any revenue since inception. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

We
did not manufacture any products, and hence did not incur any direct costs related to production or carrying inventory, since inception.

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased compared to three months ended September
30, 2023, primarily due to higher employee related costs driven by an increase in stock based
compensation and increase in the number of employees, increase in legal fees, professional and consulting fees, and in
other administrative expenses in line with growth in operations. The increase was partially offset by decrease in, marketing advisory services and other consulting,
legal services and advisory services with respect to the Company s organization incurred in comparative
period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased compared to the period March 16, 2023
(inception) to September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher employee related costs driven by an increase in stock based compensation
expense and number of employees, increase in legal and professional services such as legal fees, professional and consulting fees,
accounting advisory, statutory auditor fees, technical consultants and business consulting and an increase in business development and other administrative expenses in line with
growth in operations. The increase was partially offset by decrease in marketing advisory services and other consulting,
legal services and advisory services with respect to the Company s organization incurred in comparative
period.

Income (Expenses) 

SAFE
note issuance costs 

SAFE
note issuance costs of Nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 29,655 and 466,302 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 and period since March 16, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily represent
 435,000 of capital advisory services fees paid to related party for sourcing the SAFE note commitment from the investor and 31,302
of legal costs incurred towards setting up and executing the SAFE note agreements. 

27 

Other
transaction costs

represent fees and expenses, primarily legal expenses associated with evaluation of potential other SPAC merger opportunities that
the Company ultimately did not execute, including 100,000 of fees paid to a related party. 

Interest
expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expenses increased compared to three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily
due to interest expense incurred on the financing agreement for the Company s purchase of D O and other insurance policies.
The Company had no financing agreement during the comparative period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expenses increased compared to the period March 16, 2023 (inception) to September
30, 2023, primarily due to interest expense incurred on the financing agreement for purchase
of general insurance policies. 

Change
in fair value of investment in equity securities 

The
increase in fair value of investment in equity securities of 11,678 and decrease in the fair value of investment of 150,994 during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, is due to change in fair value of investment in QXR based on
readily available quoted prices for such investment. The Company did not have any such investment in the comparative
period. 

Change
in fair value of SAFE notes 

The
increase in fair value of SAFE notes of Nil and 955,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, is due
to changes in estimates related to inputs used in the valuation, which have been classified as liability instruments, based on third
party valuations, prior to the conversion of the instruments into Common Stock. The SAFE notes, which had previously been classified as
liability instruments, were converted to equity following the consummation of the Business Combination with GPAC II on July 8, 2024.
The Company had not issued any such SAFE notes in the comparative period. 

Change
in fair value of convertible notes 

The
increase in fair value of convertible notes of Nil and 471,400 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is due to changes
in estimates related to inputs used in the valuation, which have been classified as liability instruments, based on third party valuations.
The convertible notes, which had previously been classified as liability instruments, were converted to equity following the consummation
of the Business Combination with GPAC II on July 8, 2024. The Company had not issued any such convertible notes in the comparative period. 

Change
in fair value of earnout shares 

Change
in fair value of earnout shares decreased by 1,636,100 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, relates to movements in fair value
of earnout shares issued to the Sponsor, at the closing of the Business Combination, which have been classified as liability instruments in the financial statements, that need to
be recorded in the statement of operations for each reporting period, based on third party valuations carried out at period end. The
Company had not issued any such earnout shares in the comparative period. 

28 

Change
in fair value of warrants 

Change
in fair value of warrants which was an increase of 2,753,964 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, relates to
movements in fair value of public and private placement warrants which have been classified as liability instruments in the
financial statements, that need to be recorded in the statement of operations for each reporting period, based on fair value at
period end. The Company had not issued any such warrants in the comparative period. 

Tax
expenses 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, three months ended September 30, 2023 and period since March 16, 2023 (inception)
through September 30, 2023, the tax expense is Nil, due to net losses incurred during these periods. We do not carry any deferred tax
assets on the balance sheet as at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards resulting
from historically incurred net operating losses and full valuations allowance of those losses, as our ability to realize future tax benefits
related to these assets is largely dependent upon operational profitability, which is uncertain. As a result of this uncertainty, we
have established a full valuation allowance, and have not recognized a net provision or benefit for income taxes in the periods reported. 

Net
loss 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 10,092,312 and 14,185,887 respectively, and
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from March 16, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, the
Company incurred a net loss of 843,800 and 2,828,585 respectively. Since the Company is yet to start commercial production of
battery grade lithium, the operating expenses are expected to increase, as the Company starts to recruit more personnel to perform
general operational tasks and set up the Facility and executed supply agreements. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview

We have devoted substantial efforts and financial resources to raising capital and organizing and staffing the Company, and
as a result, have incurred significant operating losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit
of 43.0 million and 3.8 million respectively. 

We
have not earned any revenue and have been operating at a loss since inception. We have an accumulated deficit and stockholders 
deficit. 

Liquidity
Requirements 

Our
primary requirements for liquidity and capital are investment in new facilities, new technologies, working capital and general corporate
needs. Specifically, in this regard, the total refinery cost, which includes all direct and indirect costs and contingencies needed to
build the refinery, has been estimated at 1,165 million. We intend to finance our project cost through a mix of debt, equity and potential
government grants. We expect our operational expenditures to increase for the foreseeable future in connection with ongoing and future
activities. Specifically, expenditures will increase as we: 

Secure
 and build facilities; 

invest
 in research and development activities to advance the development of our technologies; and 

incur
 additional expenses associated with transitioning to, and operating as, a public company. 

Our
current and ongoing liquidity requirements will depend on many factors, including: our launch cadence, the timing and extent of spending
to support additional development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced offerings, the continuing market adoption of our offerings,
the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in manufacturing facilities and additional spaceports. In addition,
we may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, business offerings and technologies.
However, we do not have agreements or commitments to enter into any such acquisitions or investments at this time. 

29 

Sources
of Liquidity and Going Concern 

We
have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of Legacy Stardust Power Common Stock, promissory notes, SAFE notes, and convertible
equity agreements. As of September 30, 2024, our promissory notes were fully repaid. To continue as a going concern, we anticipate
funding our near-term operations through the sale of equity securities, promissory notes, additional SAFE notes, debt financing or from
other capital sources. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail, delay, or eliminate some or all of our
planned activities, or raise additional financing to continue to fund operations, and may not be able to continue as a going
concern. 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is a
development stage entity having no revenues, has incurred net loss since inception of 43,050,972 and has stockholders 
deficit of 13,304,610 as at September 30, 2024. The Company expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its
operating and investment plans. These costs exceed the Company s existing cash balance and net working capital. 

On
October 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a related
Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC B.
Riley Principal Capital II ). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Purchase
Agreement, the Company will have the right, in its sole discretion, to sell up to 50,000,000 of newly issued shares of the
Company s Common Stock to B. Riley Principal Capital II, subject to certain conditions and limitations contained in the
Purchase Agreement, from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement. Sales of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, and the timing of any sales, are solely at the option of the Company. We believe that the cash on hand, and additional
investments available through issuance of new Common Stock, will be inadequate to satisfy the Company s working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon management s plan to raise additional capital from the issuance of equity or receive additional borrowings to
fund the Company s operating and investing activities over the next year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing,
or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. Failure to secure adequate financing could have
a material adverse effect on the business, operations and financial performance of the Company. 

Promissory
notes 

In
March 2023, Legacy Stardust Power issued unsecured notes to three related parties. The notes payable provided the Company the ability to draw
up to 1 million in aggregate in the following timing: 160,000 until December 31, 2023, and 840,000 until December 31, 2025. These loan
facilities accrue interest, compounding semi-annually, at the long-term semiannual Federal rate, as established by the Internal Revenue
Service, which effectively was 3.71 for the period from March 2023, when the notes were drawn. 

As
of September 30, 2023, Legacy Stardust Power utilized the entirety of the available facilities, and 160,000 was payable by December 31, 2023, and 840,000
was payable by December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has repaid all of the notes payable. 

Insurance
funding borrowing 

On
November 19, 2023, Legacy Stardust Power borrowed 80,800 from First Insurance Funding (a Wintrust Company) to finance its insurance
policies. The total of premium, taxes and fees aggregated to 101,000, of which an initial down payment of 20,200 was paid by
Stardust Power, and the balance financed through First Insurance Funding. The loan has an annual percentage rate of 8.25 , and is
payable in 10 installments through September 21, 2024. As at September 30, 2024, the loan was fully repaid. 

30 

On
July 18, 2024, the Company entered into a financing agreement of 465,838 for the purchase of an insurance policy with
AFCO Insurance Premium Finance. The debt is payable in monthly installments of 44,162 per month for 11 months. Payments include a
stated interest rate of 8.46 and are secured against a lien on the insurance policy. 

SAFE
notes and convertible notes 

On
June 6, 2023, Legacy Stardust Power received 2,000,000 in cash from a single investor and funded the August 2023 SAFE note on
August 15, 2023. The funds were received from an unrelated third party, through its entity which is currently being managed under
the purview of an investment management agreement between them and VIKASA Capital Advisors, LLC (a related party) in consideration
for which VIKASA Capital Advisors, LLC is paid investment management fees. 

On
November 18, 2023, Legacy Stardust Power amended the August 2023 SAFE note (the amended August 2023 SAFE note ), which
introduced a discount rate of 20 to (a) the lowest price per share of preferred stock sold in the preferred stock purchase, or (b)
the listing price of the Combined Company Common Stock upon consummation of a SPAC transaction or IPO. On November 18, 2023, Legacy
Stardust Power also entered into the November 2023 SAFE note for an aggregate amount of 3 million with the same investor under the
same terms and conditions as the amended August 2023 SAFE note. Each of the SAFE notes converted, immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, into Legacy Stardust Power Common Stock. 

On
February 23, 2024, Legacy Stardust Power signed the February 2024 SAFE note for an amount of 200,000. In accordance with the terms
of the February 2024 SAFE note, the SAFE notes converted into shares of Legacy Stardust Power Common Stock, immediately prior to the
First Effective Time on similar terms to the other SAFE notes. 

The
SAFE notes are classified as liabilities based on evaluating characteristics of the instruments and are presented at fair value as
non-current liabilities in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The
SAFE notes provided Legacy Stardust Power an option to call for additional preferred stock up to 25,000,000 based on the contingent
event of SAFE note conversion and notice issued by the Stardust Power board of directors (the Board ), and achievement
of certain milestones, for up to 42 months following such conversion. This feature was determined to be an embedded feature and is
valued as part of the liability value associated with the instrument as a whole. Additionally, the SAFE notes provided the investor
certain rights upon an equity financing, change in control or dissolution as described in Note 6 of the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Company. The estimated fair value of the SAFE notes considered the timing of issuance and
whether there were changes in the various scenarios since issuance. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the SAFE notes was
 5,212,200 and were classified as a non-current liability. The SAFE notes had no interest rate or maturity date, description of
dividend and participation rights. The liquidation preference of the SAFE notes was junior to other outstanding indebtedness and
creditor claims, on par with payments for other SAFE notes and/or preferred equity, and senior to payments for other equity of the
Company that were not SAFE notes and/or pari preferred equity. 

On
March 21, 2024, Legacy Stardust Power entered into a financing commitment and equity line of credit agreement with AIGD. The
agreement replaced the above contingent commitment feature of the SAFE notes with granting Legacy Stardust Power an option to
drawdown up an additional 15,000,000 on terms similar to existing SAFE notes prior to the First Effective Time. On April 24, 2024,
Legacy Stardust Power amended and restated the August 2023 SAFE note and the November 2023 SAFE note. On May 1, 2024, Legacy Stardust Power

loss, adjusted for 9.7 million non-cash charge for change in fair value of SAFE notes, convertible notes, investments, stock based
compensation, warrant liability, earnout shares and a 4.1 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven
by an increase of 3.6 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities which represent the various costs that are expected
to be incurred as we set up operations during this period, and 0.4 million in prepaid expenses. 

For
the period March 16, 2023 (inception) to September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 1.6 million, consisting of a
 2.8 million net loss, adjusted for 0.4 million charge for SAFE note issuance costs and 0.8 million net change in operating assets
and liabilities, primarily driven by an increase of 0.8 million in accounts payable, due to related parties and other current
liabilities which primarily represent the various costs that are expected to be incurred as we set up operations during this period
partially offset by 0.02 million prepaid expenses. 

Cash
Flows Used in Investing Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 1.3 million, primarily representing 0.7 million
on account of pre-acquisition capital project costs related to construction of the refinery, 0.1 million investments in other long-term

related to acquisition of land. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 10.1 million related primarily to cash

primarily to 2.0 million received for SAFE notes and 1.0 million cash received from the proceeds from investor deposit offset
partially by payment of SAFE notes issuance cost to related parties of 0.4 million. Additionally,
during the period, we drew down and repaid our notes payable to related parties. 

Operating
and Capital Expenditure Requirements 

The
Company has not earned any revenue and has been operating at a loss since inception. The Company has an accumulated deficit and stockholders 
deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue to finance operations over the next twelve
months and is dependent upon management s plan to raise additional capital from issuance of equity or receive additional borrowings
to fund the Company s operating and investing activities over the next one year. Our intended capital requirements depends on many factors including the capital expenditures required
to set up our Facility, and undertake all activities necessary to start commercial production, prices of capital equipment, and preliminary
costs. In the future, it will depend on our expansion of acquiring new assets/sites to have access and potential ownership of raw material.
We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual
property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. If additional financing is required from outside sources,
over and above what we are intending to raise currently, we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable
to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely
affected and may not be able to continue our intended operations as a going concern. 

Commitments
and Contractual Obligations 

We
have entered into an engineering agreement with Primero USA, Inc. for 4.7 million to provide a Front End Loading-3 report. While the Company has not entered into any other binding commitments, other strategic partnerships are being evaluated which
could lead to future contractual obligations. 

Summary
of Critical Accounting Estimates 

We
believe that the following accounting policies and estimates involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are
the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
condition and results of our operations. See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those
financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty
involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. 

Leases

At
the inception of a contract, we assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Our assessment is based on whether: (1) the contract
involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the
asset throughout the term of the contract, and (3) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. 

Leases
are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria
are met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the
asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset, or (5) the leased asset
is so specialized that the asset will have little to no value at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease
if it does not meet any one of the above criteria. 

We
have elected the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected not to
record right of use assets and associated lease liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet for leases that have
a term, including any reasonably assured renewal terms, of 12 months or less at the lease commencement date. We recognize lease payments
for these short-term leases in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term
and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 

33 

We
have one short-term lease for office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 

Deferred
Transaction Costs 

In
accordance with Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 5: Miscellaneous Accounting A. Expenses of
Offering SAB Topic 5 ), public offering related costs, including legal fees and advisory and consulting fees,
are deferred until consummation/completion of the proposed public offering. Legacy Stardust Power has deferred 1,005,109 of related
costs incurred towards proposed public offering which are presented within current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets as at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
Legacy Stardust Power deferred 6,496,114 of related costs incurred towards the proposed public offering. After the consummation of
the Business Combination, costs allocated to equity-classified instruments amounting to 7, 501 ,223
were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. 

Subsequent
to the quarter end, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II. The Company has
deferred 199,724 of related costs incurred towards this offering which is presented within current assets in the unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheets as at September 30, 2024. If the offering is terminated, the deferred
offering costs will be expensed. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which provides for deferred taxes
using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more
likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely
than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances.
We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. 

Earnout
Share Liability, SAFE Notes, and Convertible Notes 

We
account for the earnout share liability, SAFE notes, and convertible notes in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480,
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, whereby it is accounted
for as a liability which requires initial and subsequent measurements at fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at
each balance sheet date until a triggering event, equity financing, change in control or dissolution occurs, and any change in fair
value is recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value estimate
includes significant inputs not observable in market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The
valuation uses probabilities considering pay-offs under various scenarios as follows: (i) an equity financing where the SAFE notes
and convertible note will convert into certain preferred stock; (ii) a change in control where the SAFE note and convertible note
holders will have an option to receive a portion of the cash and other assets equal to the purchase amount; (iii) a dissolution
event where the SAFE notes and convertible note holders will be entitled to the purchase amount subject to liquidation priority and (iv)
achievement of Combined Company Common Stock price targets, where the earnout share liability will convert into certain number of
shares of Common Stock. The value of the instrument is likely to vary significantly based on the probability of each of the
conversion scenarios that occurs, and management will reassess such probability at each reporting period. These probabilities will
ultimately be factored into the valuation of the instrument and will require third party valuation experts to assist in the
determination of this value. The changes in value of the instrument could impact the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements materially and therefore constitute a critical estimate. 

34 

Fair
Value of Common Stock 

Due
to the absence of an active market for our Common Stock prior to consummation of the business combination, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, the fair value of our
Common Stock is estimated based on valuation carried out by third party appraisers and approved by our Board based on current
available information and after exercising reasonable judgment. This estimate requires significant judgment and considers several
factors, including: 

independent
 third-party valuations of our Common Stock; 

estimated
 probabilities of future liquidation scenarios; 

projected
 future cash flows provided by management; 

guideline
 public company information; 

discount
 rates; 

our
 actual operating and financial performance; 

current
 business conditions and projections; 

our
 stage of development; 

U.S.
 and global capital markets conditions; and 

expected
 volatility based on comparable public company stock performance over the time period being measured. 

Probability
weightings assigned to potential liquidity scenarios were based on management s expected near-term and long-term funding requirements
and assessment of the most attractive liquidation possibilities at the time of the valuation. In the most heavily weighted scenarios,
the enterprise valuation was calculated using a valuation approach based on a combination of the guideline public company approach, an
income approach analysis with an option pricing model and a cost approach, to determine the amount of aggregate equity value allocated
to our Common Stock. 

In
all scenarios, a discount for lack of marketability DLOM was applied to arrive at a fair value of common shares. A DLOM
accounts for the lack of marketability of shares that are not publicly traded. 

Application
of these approaches and methodologies involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are complex and subjective, such
as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, operations and cash flows, discount rates, industry and economic outlook,
and the probability of and timing associated with potential future events. Changes in any or all estimates and assumptions or the
relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each relevant valuation date and may have a material impact on
the valuation of our Common Stock. Estimates of the fair value of the Common Stock are used in the measurement of stock based
compensation. Following the Business Combination, it is no longer necessary to determine the fair value of our business as the
Stardust Power Common Stock is now publicly traded.

Segment
Reporting 

The
Company reports segment information in the same way management internally organizes the business in assessing performance and making
decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting . The Company has
a single reportable operating segment which operates as a single business platform. In reaching this conclusion, management considered
the definition of the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), how the business is defined by the CODM, the nature of the
information provided to the CODM, how the CODM uses such information to make operating decisions, and how resources and performance are
accessed. The Company has a single, common management team and our cash flows are reported and reviewed with no distinct cash flows.

Events 

See
Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details regarding
subsequent events. 

Stardust
Power s Risk Management Framework 

Commodity
Price Risk 

Global
commodity prices, especially for lithium hydroxide and, or lithium carbonate and other battery metals changes may impact
the margins and produce less revenue or losses for the Company. Global lithium commodities market are still somewhat nascent and as the
global supply chain changes this could impact the prices of commodities. The costs of lithium inputs could be affected as well further
impacting margins and profitability. In order to address this risk, the Company is negotiating fixed price off take agreement with suppliers
of raw material required. Also, we seek to enter into long-term partnerships to limit potential volatility in pricing. Additionally,
in the future, we intend to enter into strategic partnerships that would create long-term alignment with buyers. 

While
there has been significant recent softness and reduced demand in respect of EVs and a significant decrease in the price of lithium, we
believe that the long-term prospects for both remain positive. 

Global
Demand and Product Pricing Risk 

New
supplies of lithium and the emergence of new refiners both here in the United States and globally, could impact the global supply chain
and product prices. Existing companies may be seeking to increase their capacity to provide lithium products and new companies seek to
bring capacity online further increasing supply. Other companies may seek to enter the market. Also, the demand for lithium may be impacted
by emerging technologies and other battery chemistries that may decrease the reliance on lithium and could result in reducing product
prices. In order to address fluctuations in product price, and in lines with industry norms, the Company is intending to enter into 10-year
long-term sales contracts with EV manufacturers, whereby we expect to have a cap and floor pricing strategy, and both, customer and the
Company, sharing the difference between actual price and cap or floor pricing. We may further limit chemistry risk by refining to lithium
carbonate prior to potentially refining to lithium hydroxide so we can meet market demands for either product. We stay informed on current
trends in battery chemistry to project market demand. 

Insurance
Risk 

The
nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed any applicable insurance policy limits or could be excluded from coverage.
There are also risks against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. The potential costs, which could be
associated with any liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of insurance coverage, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations
may cause substantial delays and require significant capital outlays, adversely affecting our future earnings and competitive position
and potentially our financial viability. We may limit insurance risk by being proactive in our policies for environmental impact and
climate change impact. Through strict adherence to company protocols we may limit certain types of risk. Also, we intend to work only
with best-in-class providers, who are adept at assessing various risks in our line of business adequately. 

37 

Strategic
Risk 

Strategic
risk represents the risk associated with executive management failing to develop and execute on the appropriate strategic vision which
demonstrates a commitment to our culture, leverages our core competencies, appropriately responds to external factors in the marketplace,
and is in the best interests of our clients, employees, and members. By working with best-in-class partners and consultants who are industry
experts, as well as by leveraging the knowledge of our senior executive team, we expect to be able to limit or address strategic risk
and execution risk. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market
Risk Framework 

Market
risk represents the risk of losses, or financial volatility, that may result from the change in value of our products due to fluctuations
in its market price. The scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market-sensitive data related to input
and selling prices. We expect to be able to limit this risk by using third parties to finance acquisition of feedstock and logistics,
as required. We may enter into long-term arrangements for supply to limit impacts of market risk. 

The
Company s different types of market risk include: 

Interest
rate risk 

Interest
rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from
changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in the slope of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, and the rate
of prepayments on our interest-earning assets (e.g., inventories) and our funding sources (e.g., short-term financing) which finance
these assets. Project finance and loan facilities are a key component of our financing strategy. Volatility in the interest rate market
could impede our plans for growth. 

Liquidity
risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk that we are unable to timely access necessary funding sources in order to operate our business, as well as the risk
that we are unable to timely divest securities that we hold in connection with our sales and trading activities. The Company has been
successful in equity financing in the past but there is no assurance that it will continue to be able to finance the Company with equity
financing. The Company does not have substantial credit lines for financing the Company. 

Credit
risk 

Credit
risk refers to the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty, customer, borrower, or
issuer. The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction and the
parties involved. Credit risk also results from an obligor s failure to meet the terms of any contract with us or otherwise fail
to perform as agreed. This may be reflected through issues such as settlement obligations or payment collections. 

38 

Operational
risk 

The
success of our plan requires us to be able to operationally deliver on the project plan and timelines as projected by management. In
order to mitigate and control operational risk, we will develop policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational
risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization. We will also have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover
critical processes on a company-wide basis, and redundancies are built into our systems as we deem appropriate. These control mechanisms
will be designed to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating
within established corporate policies and limits. We are leveraging and intend to continue implementing established best practices for
our industry to reduce operational risk. 

Human
Capital Risk 

The
success of our business is dependent upon the skills, expertise, industry knowledge and performance of our employees. Human capital risks
represent the risks posed if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals, particularly those having specialized technical knowledge
in the exploration, extraction, and purification of brine from varying sources to produce battery grade lithium, and employees who are
motivated to serve the best interests of our clients, thereby serving the best interests of our Company. Attracting and retaining employees
depends, among other things, on our Company s culture, management, work environment, geographic locations and compensation. There
are risks associated with the proper recruitment, development and rewards of our employees to ensure quality performance and retention.
We offer competitive compensation and benefits to retain human capital, intend to offer educational opportunities to allow advancement,
and promote balance in work life conditions by offering hybrid work from home options. 

Legal
and regulatory risk 

Legal
and regulatory risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and loss to our reputation
we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes
of conduct applicable to our business activities. We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which
we conduct our business. We are in the process of setting up procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements, such as public company reporting obligations, regulatory net capital requirements, sales practices, potential
conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. We will also establish procedures that are designed to require
that our policies relating to ethics and business conduct are followed. 

Market
Risk Exposure 

Interest
Rate Risk 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any significant risk for changes in interest rates. 

Credit
Risk 

We
are subject to credit risk with respect to our cash balances for those amounts in excess of the FDIC insured amount of 250,000. The Company
has only one financial banking institution. 

Inflation
Risk 

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its
impact on the general economy. However, we are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment due to macroeconomic conditions
and have limited data and experience doing so in our history, particularly as we continue to invest in growth in our business. The principal
inflationary factor affecting our business is higher costs. Our inability or failure to address challenges relating to inflation could
harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

39 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
are required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the period ending December 31, 2021 and thereafter.
Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth
company would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on internal control
over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting
firm attestation requirement. 

Disclosure
controls are procedures with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act,
such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls are designed with the objective of ensuring that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Background
and Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

During
the period from March 16, 2023 (inception) to December 31, 2023, the Company s management identified material weaknesses in the
implementation of the COSO 13 Framework (which establishes an effective control environment), lack of segregation of duties and management
oversight, and control surrounding maintenance of adequate repository of contracts, appropriate classifications of expenses and complex
financial instruments. We will design and implement measures to improve our controls over financial reporting process and to remediate
these material weaknesses. Our ability to comply with the annual internal control report requirements will depend on the effectiveness
of our financial reporting controls across our Company. We expect these systems and controls to involve significant expenditures and
may become more complex as our business grows. To effectively manage this complexity, we will need to continue to improve our operational,
financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. For more information, please refer to Risk Factors
- We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses,
or if we experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future, or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system
of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results, which could result
in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price in our Prospectus. In light of this fact, our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures
and concluded that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the material weakness remediation efforts underway, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

Investing
in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks are more fully described in the section titled Risk Factors 
included in our prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on August 9, 2024 (the Prospectus in addition to the information in this Quarterly Report. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse effect on our results
of operations or financial condition. A summary of these risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, operating results and prospectus include the following: 

Our limited history
makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment. 

Our management has identified conditions that raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We are a development
stage company, and there is no guarantee that our development will result in the commercial production of lithium from brine sources. 

Pipeline of lithium
feedstock may prove to be non-viable, which could have material adverse impact on our business and operations. 

Even if we are successful
 in completing all initial phases and the first commercial production at our large central refinery optimized for multiple inputs of
 lithium brine inputs (the Facility in Oklahoma and consistently produce battery grade lithium on a commercial scale,
 we may not be successful in commencing and expanding commercial operations to support the growth of our business. 

Our products may
not qualify for use for our intended customers. 

Delays and other
obstacles may prevent the successful completion of our Facility. 

Lithium can be
highly combustible, and if we have incidents, it could adversely impact us. 

The lithium brine
industry includes well capitalized players. 

Low-cost producers
could disrupt the market and be able to provide products cheaper than the Company. 

We may be unable
to qualify for existing federal and state level grants and incentives and the grants and incentives may not be released to us as quickly
or efficiently as we anticipate or at all. 

Our success as a company
 producing battery grade lithium and related products depends to a great extent on the capabilities of our partners for lithium
 extraction from brine and our ability to secure capital for the implementation of brine processing plants. 

Changes in technology
or other developments could adversely affect demand for lithium compounds or result in preferences for substitute products. 

The development
of our lithium refinery is highly dependent upon the currently projected demand for and uses of lithium-based end products. 

Our future growth
and success are dependent upon consumers demand for electric vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive,
cyclical and volatile. 

41 

We may be unable
to successfully negotiate final, binding terms related to our current non-binding memoranda of understanding and letters of intent for
supply and offtake agreements, which could harm our commercial prospects. 

Our future business
prospects could be adversely affected if we are unable to enter into definitive agreements relating to contemplated joint ventures and,
if such agreements are in fact completed, there can be no assurance that the required financing for such joint ventures will be available,
that their respective projects will be completed in a timely manner, or that they will ultimately be successful. 

If we fail to adequately
protect our intellectual property or technology (including any later developed or acquired intellectual property or technology), our
competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect
our rights. 

The reduction or
elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy technologies, or the failure to renew such subsidies
and incentives, could reduce demand for our products, lead to a reduction in our revenues, and adversely impact our operating results
and liquidity. 

We identified material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses or if we experience
additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control
over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results, which could result in loss of investor
confidence and adversely impact our stock price. 

An active trading
market for Common Stock may never develop or be sustained, which may make it difficult to sell the shares of Common Stock you receive. 

The Company s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which became effective on July 8, 2024, provide for a classified board of directors, with directors
serving staggered three-year terms, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors. 

There is no guarantee
that the warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless. 

We may redeem your
unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. 

There
have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in the Prospectus, which are incorporated herein by reference, except as
set forth below. The risk factors described in this Quarterly Report and in the Prospectus are not the only risks that we face. Additional
risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. If
any such risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
growth prospects and cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose
additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

It
is not possible to predict the actual number of shares we will sell under the Purchase Agreement to B. Riley Principal Capital II, or
the actual gross proceeds resulting from those sales. 

On
October 7, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital
II, pursuant to which B. Riley Principal Capital II has committed to purchase up to 50,000,000 of shares of our Common Stock, subject
to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The shares of our Common Stock that may be issued under the
Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to B. Riley Principal Capital II at our discretion from time to time for a period of up to 36 months
(unless the Purchase Agreement is earlier terminated) beginning on the date on which the registration statement registering the shares
of Common Stock issued to B. Riley Principal Capital II for resale has been declared effective by the SEC and all other conditions to
B. Riley Principal Capital II s obligations to purchase the Common Stock set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been initially
satisfied. 

We
generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares of Common Stock to B. Riley Principal Capital II
under the Purchase Agreement. Sales of our Common Stock, if any, to B. Riley Principal Capital II under the Purchase Agreement will depend
upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II all,
some or none of the shares of our Common Stock that may be available for us to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement. Depending on market liquidity at the time, resales of those shares by B. Riley Principal Capital II may cause the
public trading price of our Common Stock to decrease. 

42 

Because
the per share purchase price that B. Riley Principal Capital II will pay for shares of Common Stock that we may elect to effect pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the market prices of our Common Stock during the applicable purchase valuation period
for each purchase made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, it is not possible for us to predict, as of the date of this Quarterly Report
and prior to any such sales, the number of shares of Common Stock that we will sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II under the Purchase
Agreement, the purchase price per share that B. Riley Principal Capital II will pay for shares purchased from us under the Purchase Agreement,
or the aggregate gross proceeds that we will receive from those purchases by B. Riley Principal Capital II under the Purchase Agreement. 

Although
the Purchase Agreement provides that we may sell up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 of our Common Stock to B. Riley Principal Capital
II, only 6,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (of which 63,694 represent the commitment shares we issued to B. Riley Principal Capital
II upon our execution of the Purchase Agreement on October 7, 2024) are being registered under the Securities Act for resale by B. Riley
Principal Capital II pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1. If it becomes necessary for us to issue and sell to B. Riley Principal
Capital II under the Purchase Agreement more than the 6,436,306 shares being registered in order to receive aggregate gross proceeds
equal to 50,000,000 under the Purchase Agreement, we must first (i) obtain stockholder approval to issue more than 9,569,701 shares
of Common Stock, the number of shares representing 19.99 of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution
of the Purchase Agreement, in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules (assuming such shares to not qualify for exclusion from such share
limit because they were sold at a price exceeding the minimum price calculated in accordance with Nasdaq rules) and (ii)
file with the SEC one or more additional registration statements to register under the Securities Act the resale by B. Riley Principal
Capital II of any such additional shares of our Common Stock we wish to sell from time to time under the Purchase Agreement, which the
SEC must declare effective, in each case before we may elect to sell any additional shares of our Common Stock to B. Riley Principal
Capital II under the Purchase Agreement. The number of shares of Common Stock ultimately offered for resale by B. Riley Principal Capital
II is dependent upon the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, we elect to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II under the Purchase
Agreement. Any issuance and sale by us under the Purchase Agreement of a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock in addition to
the 6,500,000 shares of Common Stock being registered for resale could cause additional substantial dilution to our stockholders. Our
inability to access a portion or the full amount available under the Purchase Agreement, in the absence of any other financing sources,
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

RESTRICTED
SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT 

This
Restricted Share Unit Agreement (together with the Grant Notice to which this Agreement is attached, this Agreement is made as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice to which this Agreement is attached by and between Stardust Power Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and [ ] (the Participant ). Capitalized
terms used but not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan or the Grant Notice. 

1.
 Award . In consideration of the Participant s past and/or continued employment with, or service to, the Company or a
member of the Company Group and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
effective as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the Date of Grant ), the Company hereby grants
to the Participant the number of RSUs set forth in the Grant Notice on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement
and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan
and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. To the extent vested, each RSU represents the right to receive one Share, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan. Unless and until the RSUs have become vested
in the manner set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to receive any Shares or other payments in respect of
the RSUs. Prior to settlement of this Award, the RSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from
the general assets of the Company. 

2.
 Vesting of RSUs . The RSUs shall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice. Upon the Participant s
Termination of Service prior to the vesting of all of the RSUs, any unvested RSUs (and all rights arising from such RSUs and from being
a holder thereof) will terminate automatically without any further action by the Company and will be forfeited without further notice
and at no cost to the Company. 

3.
 Dividend Equivalent Rights . In the event that the Company declares and pays a regular cash dividend in respect of its outstanding
Shares (which, for clarity, does not include any extraordinary cash dividend) and, on the record date for such dividend, the Participant
holds RSUs granted pursuant to this Agreement that have not been settled, the Participant shall not be entitled to receive such cash
dividends. 

4.
 Settlement of RSUs . As soon as administratively practicable following the vesting of RSUs pursuant to Section 2 , but
in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year after such vesting date, the Company shall deliver to
the Participant a number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to this Award. All Shares issued hereunder shall be delivered
either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares to the Participant or by entering such shares in book-entry form, as determined
by the Administrator in its sole discretion. The value of Shares shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this
 Section 4 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded
or secured obligation of any kind. 

5.
 Tax Withholding . To the extent that the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award results in compensation income or wages
to the Participant for federal, state, local and/or foreign tax purposes, the Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the
Company regarding the payment of any income tax, social insurance contribution or other applicable taxes that are required to be withheld
in respect of this Award, which arrangements include the delivery of cash or cash equivalents, Shares (including previously owned Shares
(which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest), net settlement, a broker-assisted sale, or other cashless withholding
or reduction of the amount of shares otherwise issuable or delivered pursuant to this Award), other property, or any other legal consideration
the Administrator deems appropriate. If such tax obligations are satisfied through net settlement or the surrender of previously owned
Shares, the maximum number of Shares that may be so withheld (or surrendered) shall be the number of Shares that have an aggregate Fair
Market Value on the date of withholding or surrender equal to the aggregate amount of such tax liabilities determined based on the greatest
withholding rates for federal, state, local and/or foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that may be utilized without creating
adverse accounting treatment for the Company with respect to this Award, as determined by the Administrator. Any fraction of a Share
required to satisfy such tax obligations shall be disregarded and the amount due shall be paid instead in cash to the Participant. The
Participant acknowledges that there may be adverse tax consequences upon the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award or disposition
of the underlying shares and that the Participant has been advised, and hereby is advised, to consult a tax advisor. The Participant
represents that the Participant is in no manner relying on the Board, the Administrator, the Company or a member of the Company Group
or any of their respective managers, directors, officers, employees or authorized representatives (including attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and financial representatives) for tax advice or an assessment of such tax consequences. 

6.
 Non-Transferability . During the lifetime of the Participant, the RSUs may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in
any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the Shares underlying the RSUs have been issued,
and all restrictions applicable to such Shares have lapsed. Neither the RSUs nor any interest or right therein shall be liable for the
debts, contracts or engagements of the Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer,
alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means, whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or
by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and
any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by
the preceding sentence. 

7.
 Compliance with Applicable Law . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of Shares hereunder
will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable law with respect to such securities and with the requirements
of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Shares may then be listed. No Shares will be issued hereunder if such issuance
would constitute a violation of any applicable law or regulation or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which
the Shares may then be listed. In addition, Shares will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities
Act is in effect at the time of such issuance with respect to the shares to be issued or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company,
the shares to be issued are permitted to be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed
by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder will relieve the Company
of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition
to any issuance of Shares hereunder, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any requirements that may be necessary or appropriate
to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance
as may be requested by the Company. 

B- 2 

8.
 Rights as a Shareholder . The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares that
may become deliverable hereunder unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such Shares, and no adjustments
shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such Shares, except as otherwise
specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement. 

9.
 Execution of Receipts and Releases . Any issuance or transfer of Shares or other property to the Participant or the Participant s
legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with this Agreement shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of
such person hereunder. As a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, the Company may require the Participant or the Participant s
legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee to execute (and not revoke within any time provided to do so) a release and receipt
therefor in such form as it shall determine appropriate; provided , however , that any review period under such release will
not modify the date of settlement with respect to vested RSUs. 

10.
 No Right to Continued Employment, Service or Awards . Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the RSUs thereunder
pursuant to the Grant Notice and this Agreement, shall confer upon the Participant the right to continued employment by, or a continued
service relationship with, the Company or any member of the Company Group, or any other entity, or affect in any way the right of the
Company or any such member of the Company Group, or any other entity to terminate such employment or other service relationship at any
time. Unless otherwise provided in a written employment agreement or by applicable law, the Participant s employment by the Company,
or any such member of the Company Group, or any other entity shall be on an at-will basis, and the employment relationship may be terminated
at any time by either the Participant or the Company, or any such member of the Company Group, or other entity for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause or notice. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of
such termination, shall be determined by the Administrator or its delegate, and such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding
for all purposes. The grant of the RSUs is a one-time benefit that was made at the sole discretion of the Company and does not create
any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Awards or benefits in the future in lieu of Awards in the future, including any
adjustment to wages, overtime, benefits or other compensation. Any future Awards will be granted at the sole discretion of the Company. 

11.
 Notices . All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the parties
at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

Consent to Electronic Delivery; Electronic Signature . In lieu of receiving documents in paper format, the Participant agrees,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to accept electronic delivery of any documents that the Company may be required to deliver (including,
but not limited to, prospectuses, prospectus supplements, grant or award notifications and agreements, account statements, annual and
quarterly reports and all other forms of communications) in connection with this and any other Award made or offered by the Company.
Electronic delivery may be via a Company electronic mail system or by reference to a location on a Company intranet to which the Participant
has access. The Participant hereby consents to any and all procedures the Company has established or may establish for an electronic
signature system for delivery and acceptance of any such documents that the Company may be required to deliver, and agrees that his or
her electronic signature is the same as, and shall have the same force and effect as, his or her manual signature. 

13.

to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirement imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation.

 Entire Agreement; Amendment . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter
hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to the
RSUs granted hereby; provided however , that the terms of this Agreement shall not modify and shall be subject to
the terms and conditions of any employment, consulting and/or severance agreement between the Company (or a member of the Company Group
or other entity) and the Participant in effect as of the date a determination is to be made under this Agreement. Without limiting the
scope of the preceding sentence, except as provided therein, all prior understandings and agreements, if any, among the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter hereof are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect. The Administrator may, in its sole
discretion, amend this Agreement from time to time in any manner that is not inconsistent with the Plan; provided , however ,
that except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, any such amendment that materially reduces the rights of the Participant
shall be effective only if it is in writing and signed by both the Participant and an authorized officer of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to an initial public offering, the Company may take any of the following actions (including with respect to the
Shares issued under this Agreement) without the consent or authorization of the Participant or any other person: (i) subdivide (by any
split, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding Shares into a greater number of Shares, (ii) combine (by reverse split, combination,
or otherwise) its outstanding Shares into a lesser number of Shares, (iii) make adjustments as determined by the Administrator to prevent
dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, the Participant under the Plan or this Agreement, and (iv) provide
for separate classes or series of common stock such as Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (including, without limitation,
to provide for specific voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and other applicable
rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions as provided therein).

15.
 Severability and Waiver . If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Waiver by any party of any breach of this
Agreement or failure to exercise any right hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or right. The failure of
any party to take action by reason of such breach or to exercise any such right shall not deprive the party of the right to take action
at any time while or after such breach or condition giving rise to such rights continues. 

16.
 Company Recoupment of Awards . The Participant s rights with respect to this Award shall in all events be subject
to (a) any right that the Company may have under any Company recoupment policy or other agreement or arrangement with the Participant,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stardust Power Inc. Clawback Policy and (b) any right or obligation that the Company may have
regarding the clawback of incentive-based compensation under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any other Applicable Laws. 

17.

the date of death of the specified employee) and shall instead be paid (in a manner set forth in this Agreement) upon expiration of such
delay period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any other member of the Company Group makes any representations
that the RSUs provided under this Agreement are exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code and in no event shall the Company
or any member of the Company Group be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred
by the Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
