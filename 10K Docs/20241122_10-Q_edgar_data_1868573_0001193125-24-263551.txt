The per-share

The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares.

However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

 If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Articles, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 
 The Company s Sponsor has agreed (a) to vote any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company s with respect to the Company s pre-Business
 Combination activities prior to the closing of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Articles relating to shareholders rights of pre-Business
 Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination. 
 If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 9, 2024, 36 months from the closing of the IPO, assuming we further extend the period by up to twelve additional one-month
 periods (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share
 price, payable in cash, 

of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholder s rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit . 
 The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in cash and a working capital deficit of excluding accrued interest receivable as it is not available for working capital purposes. 
 The Company s liquidity needs up to September 30, 2024, had been satisfied through a payment from the Sponsor of (Note 6) for the Founder Shares and the remaining net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement Warrants and the Promissory Notes (as defined below), to cover certain offering expenses. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans, as defined below (Note 7). As of September 30, 2024, there were amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 
 On February 28, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the First Promissory Note in the amount of . The proceeds of the First Promissory Note were drawn in a single instance and will be used to economically facility the Company s ability to effect the extension of the termination date. The First Promissory Note was payable in full on the earlier of (a) the Company s consummation of a Business Combination or (b) December 31, 2023. 
 On May 26, 2023, the Company issued a second unsecured promissory note (the Second Promissory Note and, together with the First Promissory Note, the Promissory Notes in the amount of . The proceeds of the Second Promissory Note were drawn in a single instance and will be used to economically facility the Company s ability to effect the extension of the termination date.

drawn on the First Promissory and Second Promissory Notes, in connection the Company incurred a gain on settlement of debt of . The Note payable is considered paid in full, and the Company no longer has access to draw funds. 
 On September 8, 2023, in connection with the Sponsor Alliance Transaction, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Working Capital Promissory Note in the amount of up to , which amount was later amended to up to . The note is non-interest
 bearing and is convertible at the option of the holder into one or more private placement warrants. The proceeds of the Promissory Note will be used to finance operating costs in connection with a Business Combination. The Working Capital Promissory Note is payable in full upon the Company s consummation of a Business Combination. Management determined that there was an embedded conversion feature related to the note that would require bifurcation and be classified as a liability. However, as of September 30, 2024, the amount was determined to be immaterial. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, a principal balance of and , respectively, was outstanding under the Working Capital Promissory Note. This amount includes of advances received from the Sponsor Alliance to cover expenses until the amendment to the working capital promissory note was finalized (See Note 7). 
 On August 26, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Bioceres Note in the principal amount of to Bioceres LLC Bioceres ), an indirect shareholder of OmnigenicsAI Corp, the counterparty to the Company s previously announced business combination. The Bioceres Note bears interest at per annum. The Company shall repay all interest accrued and the principal balance on the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination. As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance outstanding is . 
 Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 
 Risks and Uncertainties 

 The military conflict that commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation in Ukraine and the surrounding region, and Hamas and Iran s Fall 2023 attack on Israel and the ensuing war, have created and are expected to create further global economic consequences, including but not limited to the possibility of extreme volatility and disruptions in the financial markets, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about economic and political stability. Such global consequences may materially and adversely affect the Company s ability to consummate an initial Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates an initial Business Combination. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate an initial Business Combination may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the global economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

in cash and a working capital deficit of excluding accrued interest receivable as it is not available for working capital purposes. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. 
 In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Account Standards Update ASU 2014-15,
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The Company has until December 9, 2024 (36 months from the closing of the IPO), if we further extend the period by up to twelve additional one-month
 periods, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution as well as insufficient cash flows raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 of the Company s Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income per share. 
 The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. The Company applies the two-class
 method in calculating earnings per share. The contractual formula utilized to calculate the redemption amount approximates fair value. The Class feature to redeem at fair value means that there is effectively only one class of stock. Changes in fair value are not considered a dividend for the purposes of the numerator in the earnings per share calculation. Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing the pro rata net income between the redeemable shares and the non-redeemable
 shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for each of the periods. The calculation of diluted income per ordinary stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.

 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40.
 Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement
 at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement,
 the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statement of operations. 
 Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants.

 The Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the -day

 The fair value of the investments held in Trust Account approximates the carrying amount primarily due to the short-term nature. 
 Warrants 

The Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40
 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the Balance Sheet. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within the statements of operations. 
 Initial Measurement 

The Warrants were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model-based approach, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The Monte Carlo simulation model s primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Warrants is the expected volatility of the ordinary shares. The expected volatility as of the Initial Public Offering date was derived from observable public warrant pricing on comparable blank-check companies without an identified target. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units, the close price of the Public Warrant price will be used as the fair value as of each relevant date. 

Expected term (years)

Expected volatility

Exercise price

Stock price

The Company s use of a Monte Carlo simulation model required the use of subjective assumptions: 

The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the five-year U.S. Treasury rate, which was commensurate with the contractual term of the Warrants, which expire on the earlier of (i) five years after the completion of the initial business combination and (ii) upon redemption or liquidation. An increase in the risk-free interest rate, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa. 

The expected term was determined to be five years, in-line
 with a typical equity investor assumed holding period 

The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility from a set of comparable publicly-traded warrants as determined based on the size and proximity of business combinations by similar special purpose acquisition companies. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa. 

The fair value of the Units, which each consist of one Class A ordinary share and one-half
 of one Public Warrant, represents the closing price on the measurement date as observed from the ticker APXIU. 
 Subsequent Measurement 

 The Warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. At the subsequent measurement dates of September 30, 2024 and December 31,2023, the Private Placement Warrants were fair valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Method.

I, except where the context requires otherwise. References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Sponsor refer to APx Cap Sponsor Group I, LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on May 13, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the initial business combination ). We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry, we intend to focus our search on companies in a SSLA or companies outside a SSLA that provide goods and services to Spanish speaking markets. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of this offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. The Company s sponsor is APx Cap Sponsor Group I, LLC (the Sponsor ). The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 9, 2021 (the IPO ). On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 17,250,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ), at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 172,500,000, including 2,250,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value 0.0001 per share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Following the closing of the IPO, an amount of 175,950,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account located in the United States at Bank of America, N.A., and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company.

Concurrently with the closing of the IPO, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,950,000 private placement warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrants. Each warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share. The proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants were added to the proceeds from the IPO held in the Trust Account (as defined below). We paid an underwriting discount at the closing of the IPO of 3.45 million. An additional fee of 6.04 million was deferred and would become payable upon our completion of an initial business combination. The deferred portion of the discount would become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event we complete our initial business combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. However, on September 28, 2022, the underwriters waived their right to receive the deferred fee, resulting in a gain from settlement of deferred underwriting commissions of approximately 6.04 million. The Proposed Business Combination On March 25, 2024, the Company, OmnigenicsAI Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company OmnigenicsAI ), Heritas Merger Sub Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of OmnigenicsAI Merger Sub and MultiplAI Health Ltd, a private limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales MultiplAI and, together with OmnigenicsAI, the Target Companies ), entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Business Combination Agreement capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report). The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to herein as the Proposed Business Combination . On August 27, 2024, Parent, MultiplAI and the MultiplAI Shareholders (as defined below) (with the consent of the Company) terminated the MultiplAI SPA (as defined below). As a result of such termination, MultiplAI will not be acquired by OmnigenicsAI, its business will not be combined pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, and all rights and obligations of MultiplAI under the Business Combination Agreement shall cease and terminate, subject to certain exceptions. Except as set forth above, no other terms of the Business Combination have been modified, and the Company and OmnigenicsAI intend to complete the combination of their businesses (without the acquisition of MultiplAI) as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. The Proposed Business Combination On the Closing Date, prior to the Merger Effective Time, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, OmnigenicsAI shall cause the consummation of the Restructuring, pursuant to which all Indebtedness (subject to certain exceptions) owed by OmnigenicsAI or any Subsidiary of OmnigenicsAI to Parent or any shareholder of Parent, shall be cancelled and extinguished.

Results of Operations Our entire activity from inception up to September 30, 2024 was related to our formation and the IPO. Since the IPO, our activity has been limited to the evaluation of business combination candidates, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination. We expect to generate small amounts of non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and investments. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after this period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 250,870 which was comprised of operating costs of 2,227,219. In this period, we incurred no unrealized loss related to the change in fair value of warrants, interest income of 2,478,916 from investments in our Trust Account and interest expense of 827. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,122,120 which was comprised of operating costs of 738,095. In this period, we incurred unrealized gain of 2,022,883 related to the change in fair value of warrants, interest income of 838,159 from investments in our Trust Account and interest expense of 827. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 3,536,796, which was comprised of operating costs of 1,550,407, one-time advisory fee income of 1,625,000, gain on settlement of debt of 117,373, interest income of 2,889,122 from investments in our Trust Account, gain on settlement of trade payables of 878,886 offset by interest expense of 82,345 and 340,833 of unrealized loss on fair value changes of warrants. The operating expenses were primarily due to fees to professionals such as the auditors, legal counsel and consultants, and insurance expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 3,595,650, which was comprised of operating costs of 188,108, one-time advisory fee income of 1,625,000, gain on settlement of debt of 117,373, interest income of 614,147 from investments in our Trust Account, gain on settlement of trade payables of 878,886 offset by interest expense of 24,442 and 572,794 of unrealized gain on fair value changes of warrants. The operating expenses were primarily due to fees to professionals such as the auditors, legal counsel and consultants, and insurance expenses. Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 168 in its operating bank account, and a working capital deficit of 3,970,122, excluding accrued interest receivable as it is not available for working capital purposes. The Company s liquidity needs up to September 30, 2024 had been satisfied through a payment from the Sponsor of 25,000 (Note 6) for the Founder Shares and the remaining net proceeds from our IPO, the Private Placement Warrants and proceeds from the Promissory Notes. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Working Capital Promissory Note in the amount of up to 2,000,000, as defined above (Note 7). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has an outstanding principal balance nil. Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. As such, the Company may need to obtain alternative liquidity and capital resources to meet its needs, which may not be available to the Company. Over this time period, the Company will be using any available funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Account Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The Company has until December 9, 2024 (36 months from the closing of the IPO) if we further extend the period by up to twelve additional one-month periods, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution, as well as insufficient cash flows, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Other Contractual Obligations Administrative Services Agreement Commencing on the date of the prospectus and until completion of the Company s initial business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of 10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support provided to members of the Company s management team. In connection with the Sponsor Alliance Transaction, the Company and APx Sponsor Group I terminated the administrative services agreement as of August 30, 2023, and no fees remain outstanding thereunder. Registration Rights The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and securities that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated as of December 6, 2021, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, these holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Underwriting Agreement The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 3,450,000, or 0.20 per unit of the gross proceeds of the initial 17,250,000 Units (inclusive of 2,250,000 Unit over-allotment option) sold in the IPO, in the aggregate. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of (i) 0.35 per unit of the gross proceeds of the initial 15,000,000 Units sold in the IPO, or 5,250,000, and (ii) 0.35 per unit of the gross proceeds from the 2,250,000 Units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option, or 787,500, aggregating to a deferred fee of 6,037,500. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Effective as of September 28, 2022, the underwriters from the Initial Public Offering resigned and withdrew from their role in the Business Combination and thereby waived their right to the deferred underwriting commissions in the amount of 6,037,500, which the Company has recorded as a gain on settlement of underwriter fees on the statement of shareholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2022 for 5,788,453, which represents the original amount recorded to accumulated deficit, and the remaining balance representing the original amount recorded to the statement of operations of 249,047 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. No deferred underwriting commissions remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Critical Accounting Policies This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting policies: Warrant Liabilities The Company accounts for warrants based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.

Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Company s ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet. Net Income Per Ordinary Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average shares of ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period. The calculation of diluted net income does not consider the effect of the warrants underlying the Units sold in the IPO (including the consummation of the Over-allotment) and the Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,575,000 Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the decision usefulness of income tax disclosures and requires the disclosure of various disaggregated information, including an entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on taxes paid. This ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption allowed. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, ASU 2023-09 would have on its disclosures. Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. JOBS Act The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.

Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the report of the independent registered public accounting firm providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of this offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective, as of September 30, 2024, because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to errors in warrant liabilities, errors in proper accounting of related party gains, classification of temporary and permanent equity, classification error in statement of cash flows, and accuracy and completeness of accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued interest receivable and redemption value of ordinary shares subject to redemption. The detection of errors did not trigger a financial restatement and had no impact on previously issued financial statements. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Remediation Plan The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed additional post-closing review procedures including reviewing historical filings and consulting with subject matter experts related to the accounting for warrant liabilities. The Company s management has expended, and will continue to expend, a substantial amount of effort and resources for the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we have improved, and will continue to improve, these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than the matters discussed above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
