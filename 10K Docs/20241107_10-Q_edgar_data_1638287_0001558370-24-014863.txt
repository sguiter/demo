For the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, a proportionate adjustment was made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding stock options, and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, the number of shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units RSUs and the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive compensation plans. Specifically, for the Series A warrants and Series B warrants issued in November 2022 that were outstanding on the effective date of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, the number of outstanding warrants did not change; instead, the warrants have an exchange ratio of eight warrants for one share of our

 million in cash as of September 30, 2024. We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. We have incurred a net loss of million and net cash used in operating activities of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due in large part to the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial for DA-1241 and Phase 1 clinical trial for DA-1726, we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2025. We plan to continue to fund our operations from equity offerings, debt financings, or other sources, potentially including collaborations, out-licensing and other similar arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the Series A Warrants will be exercised. To the extent that we can raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or in the event our existing warrants are exercised, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may slow down or stop our ongoing and planned clinical trials until such time as additional capital is raised and this may have a material adverse effect on us.

 Professional service fees Other Total Fair value changes ) As of September 30, 2024 Our warrant liabilities relate to the 2022 Series A warrants and 2022 Series B warrants, which were issued in November 2022. These warrants are considered to be derivative instruments; accordingly, we recorded their estimated fair value as warrant liabilities. We estimated the fair value of these warrants using the trading market price of our common stock due to a cashless exercise provision of these warrants whereby warrants can be exercised for one share of common stock for additional consideration, which results in an effective per warrant exercise price of . million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, under the Shared Services Agreement, which are included in operating expenses: research and development in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of op erations.

 securities purchase agreements (the Offering with an institutional investor and Dong-A, and received aggregate gross proceeds of million, of which million was received from Dong-A. The Offering was comprised of (i) shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares of common (the Pre-Funded Warr ants at a purchase price of per warrant, (iii) Series A warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the Series A Warrants ), and (iv) Series B warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock (the Series B Warrants ). Collec tively, the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants are referred to as PIPE Common Warrants. Of the total shares of common stock issued in the Offering, shares were sold to an institutional investor pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-278646), initially filed with and declared effective by the SEC in April 2024, and a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC in June 2024. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of per share and are immediately exercisable and will expire when exercised in full and the PIPE Common Warrants have an exercise price of per share and are exercisable as of September 18, 2024, which is the effective date of the stockholder approval received at the Special Meeting of Stockholders for the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants (the Stockholder Approval Date ). The Series A Warrants will expire on the earlier of the anniversary of the Stockholder Approval Date and within days following the public announcement of the Company receiving positive Phase 1 multiple ascending dose MAD data readout for DA-1726, and the Series B Warrants will expire on the earlier of the anniversary of the Stockholder Approval Date and within following the public announcement of the Company receiving positive Phase 1 Part 3 data readout for DA-1726. Based on the terms of the PIPE Common Warrants, we have concluded that the accounting classification of the PIPE Common Warrants is to be stockholders equity Under the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants and the PIPE Common Warrants issued to the institutional investor, we may not affect the exercise of any such Pre-Funded Warrants or PIPE Common Warrants, and the holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrants or PIPE Common Warrants, if, upon giving effect to such exercise, the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder (together with its affiliates, other persons acting or who could be deemed to be acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder s affiliates, and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of common stock would or could be aggregated with the holder s or any of the holder s affiliates) would exceed (in the case of the Pre-Funded Warrants) or (in the case of the PIPE Common Warrants) of the number of shares of the Company s outstanding common stock immediately after giving effect to the exercise (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation ), as such percentage ownership is calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the applicable regulations of the SEC. A holder of the Pre-Funded Warrants or PIPE Common Warrants that were issued to the institutional investor may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation to a higher or lower percentage (not to exceed ), effective days after written notice to us. Any such increase or decrease will apply only to that holder and not to any other holder of the Pre-Funded Warrants or PIPE Common Warrants. Placement agent We paid to the placement agent a cash fee equal to of the gross proceeds of the Offering received from a certain institutional investor and million for non-accountable expenses and clearing costs. In addition, we issued warrants to the placement agent s designees Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock (which represents of the sum of the shares of common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants sold to the institutional investor in the Offering) at an exercise price of per share (which represents a premium of of the offering price per share of common stock in the Offering). The Placement Agent Warrants will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of the Stockholder Approval Date and will expire on the earlier of (i) after the date that the shares of common stock

 million, which represents a non-cash issuance cost. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of these Placement Agent Warrants was , which was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model Based on the terms of the Placement Agreement Warrants, we have concluded that the accounting classification of the Placement Agent Warrants is stockholders equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Upon the exercise for cash of any PIPE Common Warrants issued to a certain institutional investor, we shall pay the placement agent (i) a cash fee of of the aggregate gross exercise price paid in cash with respect thereto and (ii) a non-cash fee in the form of additional warrants to purchase the number of shares of common stock equal to of the aggregate number of such shares of common stock underlying such warrants. The cash fee payable to the placement agent for any PIPE Common Warrants exercised by the institutional investor is accounted for as a contingent commitment and will be recorded as an offset to any gross proceeds received from any future exercises of PIPE Common Warrants by the institutional investor. The non-cash fee payable to the placement agent for any PIPE Common Warrants exercised by the institutional investor is accounted for as contingent warrants Placement Agent Contingent Warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock, which is subject to performance criteria of the institutional investor regarding any exercise for cash of any PIPE Common Warrants with an assumed grant date of the Offering closing date, and an exercise price of per share. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of these Placement Agent Contingent Warrants was , which was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Based on the terms of the placement agent engagement letter, we have concluded that the accounting classification of the Placement Agent Contingent Warrants is to be stockholders equity. On each balance sheet reporting date, we will need to assess whether it is probable for us to issue warrants to the placement agent based on whether it is probable for any PIPE Common Warrants to be exercised by the institutional investor. As of September 30, 2024, we determined that the issuance of additional warrants to the placement agent is not yet probable; accordingly, the Placement Agent Contingent Warrants had no impact on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Warrants The following tables summarize our outstanding warrants: July 2028 April 2020 (1) April 2025 January 2021 (1) July 2026 October 2021 (1) April 2025 November 2022 Series B (2) December 2027 June 2024 Placement Agent (3) July 2026 June 2024 Pre-Funded (4) no expiration date June 2024 Series A (5) September 2025 (latest date) June 2024 Series B (6) September 2029 (latest date) Total

Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Report. Certain amounts in the following discussion and analysis may not add up due to rounding, and all percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. Overview We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused primarily on developing and commercializing novel pharmaceuticals to treat cardiometabolic diseases. We have two programs currently focused on treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis MASH and obesity. MASH was formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH ). The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and its European and Latin American counterparts changed the name to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis to reflect the complexity of the disease. DA-1241 is a novel G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 119 GPR119 agonist with development optionality as a standalone and/or combination therapy for both MASH and type 2 diabetes. Agonism of GPR119 in the gut promotes the release of key gut peptides, glucagon-like peptide 1 GLP-1 ), glucagon-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor, and peptide YY. These peptides play a further role in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and weight loss. DA-1241 has beneficial effects on glucose, lipid profile and liver inflammation, supported by potential efficacy demonstrated during in vivo preclinical studies. DA-1726 is a novel oxyntomodulin analogue functioning as a GLP-1 receptor GLP1R and glucagon receptor GCGR dual agonist for the treatment of obesity that is to be administered once weekly subcutaneously. With the activation of the dual agonist, weight loss may be achieved by GLP1R reducing appetite while GCGR increasing energy expenditure. 
 While we primarily focus our financial resources and management s attention on the development of DA-1241 and DA-1726, we also have four legacy therapeutic programs designed to impact a range of indications in viral, neurodegenerative and cardiometabolic diseases, which we have, or continue to consider for, out-licensing and divestiture opportunities . In July 2024, we entered into an exclusive out-license agreement with MThera Pharma Co., LTD. MThera to provide MThera with the rights to NB-01 for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Our operations have consisted principally of performing research and development R D activities, which includes preclinical developments and clinical trials, and raising capital. Our activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, such as failing to secure additional funding before sustainable revenues and profit from operations are achieved. For more information on our business and product candidates, see Part I, Item 1. Business in our 2023 Form 10-K. DA-1241 We are currently conducting a Phase 2a trial of DA-1241 for the treatment of MASH in the United States. The Phase 2a trial has two parts and each of the parts is designed to be a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DA-1241 in subjects with presumed MASH while we follow the trend for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Part 1 of the Phase 2a trial is exploring the efficacy of DA-1241 versus placebo and subjects are randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio into 3 treatment groups: DA-1241 50 mg, DA-1241 100 mg, or placebo. Part 2 of the Phase 2a trial is exploring the efficacy of DA-1241 in combination with sitagliptin versus placebo 

 19 

Table of Contents NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Form 10-Q 
 and subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups: DA-1241 100 mg/sitagliptin 100 mg or placebo. Phase 2a trial enrollment began in August 2023 and a total of 109 patients were randomized, while 95 patients completed the dosing with the completion of the last patient last visit in October 2024. Currently, we are expecting to have top line results in December 2024. For additional information on DA-1241, see Part I, Item 1. Business, Our Pipeline, DA-1241 Treatment of MASH in our 2023 Form 10-K. DA-1726 We are currently conducting a Phase 1 trial of DA-1726 for the treatment of obesity in the United States. The Phase 1 trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics PK ), and pharmacodynamics PD of single and multiple ascending doses of DA-1726 in obese, otherwise healthy subjects. Part 1 of the Phase 1 trial is a single ascending dose SAD study and enrollment began in March 2024. In August 2024, enrollment was completed for the planned cohorts. Forty-five subjects were randomized into one of five cohorts, with each cohort having been randomized in a 6:3 ratio of DA-1726 to placebo. The SAD study was found to be safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. We are planning to add additional cohort(s) to the SAD Part 1 study to explore the maximum tolerated dose. Part 2 of the Phase 1 trial is a multiple ascending dose MAD study, enrollment began in June 2024, and is expected to enroll approximately thirty-six subjects, who will be randomized at the same 6:3 ratio into four planned cohorts, each to receive four weekly administrations of DA-1726 or placebo. Currently, the last patient visit in the MAD study is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and we are expecting to report top-line data in the first quarter of 2025. We are planning to add additional cohort(s) to the MAD Part 2 study to explore the maximum tolerated dose. We are planning a Part 3 to the Phase 1 trial to explore early proof of concept of weight loss, type of weight loss, dietary changes and durability of weight loss. We expect to begin enrollment in the third quarter of 2025, followed by an interim data readout in or around mid-2026 and top-line results are expected in the second half of 2026. For additional information on DA-1726, see Part I, Item 1. Business, Our Pipeline, DA-1726 Treatment of Obesity in our 2023 Form 10-K. Recent developments November 2024: Announced completion of last patient last visit for Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating DA-1241 for the treatment of MASH. September 2024: Announced positive top-line data from the SAD Part 1 of our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating DA-1726 for the treatment of obesity. August 2024: Completed enrollment in the SAD Part 1 of our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating DA-1726 for the treatment of obesity. August 2024: Signed a joint research agreement, along with Dong-A, with ImmunoForge to develop a long-acting, once-monthly, formulation of DA-1726 utilizing ImmunoForge s long-lasting half-life extension Elastin-Like Polypeptide ELP platform technology. July 2024: Signed an exclusive out-license agreement, providing MThera with the rights to develop and commercialize NB-01, one of our four legacy assets, for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, allowing MThera to conduct research and clinical trials, including, but not limited to, a potential Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and South Korea, for the future commercialization of NB-01.

 K ey operating information Except for the financial amounts for the presented periods in this Report (see financial amounts in the below results of operations and the condensed consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this Report), there have been no material changes to our key operating information since December 31, 2023. Refer to our 2023 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our key operating information. Results of operations Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations (in thousands, except share and per share amounts): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Operating expenses: Research and development 4,517 2,292 General and administrative 1,742 1,601 Total operating expenses 6,259 3,893 Loss from operations (6,259) (3,893) Other income (expense): Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 297 (87) Interest income 310 162 Total other income 607 75 Loss before income taxes (5,652) (3,818) Provision for income taxes Net loss (5,652) (3,818) Loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted (0.55) (0.75) Weighted average shares of common stock, basic and diluted 10,214,087 5,075,817 Total operating expenses and loss from operations Our total operating expenses and loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.3 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 60.8 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to 2.2 million in higher R D expenses and 0.1 million in higher general and administrative expenses. Our R D expenses were 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.2 million, or 97.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to increased R D activities for DA-1241 and DA-1726 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the Phase 2a clinical trial for DA-1241 and Phase 1 trial for DA-1726 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Specifically, the 2.2 million increase in R D expenses was attributable to (i) 1.9 million in higher expenditures for clinical trials, non-clinical and preclinical services, and consulting and (ii) 0.3 million in higher employee compensation and benefits. Included in R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.7 million of non-clinical and preclinical expenses incurred under the Shared Services Agreement with Dong-A as compared to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.7 million, an increase of 0.1 million, or 8.8 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to 0.2 million in higher employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by 0.1 million in lower legal and professional fees. 

 21 

Table of Contents NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Form 10-Q 
 Total other income Our total other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million, an increase of 0.5 million, or 709.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to the recording of a gain of 0.3 million related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 0.1 million in higher interest income earned on our cash balance . Provision for income taxes Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was zero percent as we have recorded a full valuation allowance for the income tax benefits attributable to our pre-tax losses. Net loss For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 5.7 million, or 0.55 per share of basic and diluted common stock, compared to a net loss of 3.8 million, or 0.75 per share of basic and diluted common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the factors described above. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations (in thousands, except share and per share amounts): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Operating expenses: Research and development 17,495 5,293 General and administrative 5,729 4,926 Total operating expenses 23,224 10,219 Loss from operations (23,224) (10,219) Other income (expense): Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 94 2,901 Interest income 711 162 Total other income 805 3,063 Loss before income taxes (22,419) (7,156) Provision for income taxes Net loss (22,419) (7,156) Loss per share of common stock, basic and diluted (3.24) (1.41) Weighted average shares of common stock, basic and diluted 6,922,338 5,064,670 Total operating expenses and loss from operations Our total operating expenses and loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 23.2 million, an increase of 13.0 million, or 127.3 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to (i) 12.2 million in higher R D expenses and (ii) 0.8 million in higher general and administrative expenses. Our R D expenses were 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.2 million, or 230.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to increased R D activities related to Phase 2a clinical trial for DA-1241 and Phase 1 trial for DA-1726 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 when R D activities began to ramp up following the acquisition of DA-1241 and DA-1726 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Specifically, the 12.2 million increase in R D expenses was attributable to (i) 11.2 million in higher expenditures for clinical trials, investigational drug manufacturing costs, non-clinical and preclinical services, and consulting and (ii) 1.0 million in higher employee compensation and benefits. Included in R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.3 million of investigational 

 22 

Table of Contents NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Form 10-Q 
 drug manufacturing costs and non-clinical and preclinical expenses incurred under the Shared Services Agreement with Dong-A as compared to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 5.7 million, an increase of 0.8 million, or 16.3 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to 0.9 million in higher employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by 0.1 million in lower legal and professional fees. Total other income Our total other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.8 million, a decrease of 2.3 million, or 73.7 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to 2.8 million in lower gain related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, partially offset by 0.5 million of higher interest income earned on our cash balance . Provision for income taxes Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was zero percent as we have recorded a full valuation allowance for the income tax benefits attributable to our pre-tax losses. Net loss For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 22.4 million, or 3.24 per share of basic and diluted common stock, compared to a net loss of 7.2 million, or 1.41 per share of basic and diluted common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to the factors described above. Going concern The determination as to whether we can continue as a going concern contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements, we had 21.7 million in cash as of September 30, 2024. We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of 130.7 million as of September 30, 2024. We have incurred a net loss of 22.4 million and net cash used in operating activities of 19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due in large part to the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial for DA-1241 and Phase 1 clinical trial for DA-1726, we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2025. We plan to continue to fund our operations from equity offerings, debt financings, or other sources, potentially including collaborations, out-licensing and other similar arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the Series A Warrants will be exercised. To the extent that we can raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or in the event our existing warrants are exercised, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may slow down or stop our ongoing and planned clinical trials until such time as additional capital is raised and this may have a material adverse effect on us. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary use of cash is to fund our R D activities. We have funded our operations primarily through public offerings 

 23 

Table of Contents NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Form 10-Q 
 of our common stock and private placements of equity and convertible securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash totaling 21.7 million. We maintain cash at financial institutions that at times may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured limits of 250 thousand per bank. Our cash balance includes liquid insured deposits, which are obligations of the program banks in which the deposits are held and qualify for FDIC insurance protection per depositor in each recognized legal category of account ownership in accordance with the rules of the FDIC. To date, we have not experienced any losses related to these funds. Registered direct offering and private placement In June 2024, we closed on a registered direct offering of 763,359 shares of common stock at a purchase price of 3.93 per share for gross proceeds of 3.0 million (the Registered Direct Offering with an institutional investor. The offering of the shares was made pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-278646), initially filed with and declared effective by the SEC in April 2024, and a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC in June 2024. In June 2024, we closed on a private placement offering (the Private Placement, and together with the Registered Direct Offering, the Offering with an institutional investor and Dong-A, and received aggregate gross proceeds of 17.0 million, of which 10.0 million was received from Dong-A. The Private Placement was comprised of (i) 2,544,530 shares of common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,781,171 shares of common (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), (iii) Series A warrants to purchase 5,089,060 shares of common stock (the Series A Warrants ), and (iv) Series B warrants to purchase up to 7,633,591 shares of common stock (the Series B Warrants ). For additional information, see Note 7. Stockholders equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Cash flows The principal use of cash in operating activities is to fund our current expenditures in support of our R D activities. Financing activities currently represent the principal source of our cash flow. The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows (in thousands). 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (19,282) (7,406) Net cash used in investing activities (8) (41) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 18,524 (80) Net decrease in cash (766) (7,527) Net cash used in operating activities was 19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of net loss of 21.6 million, partially offset by net cash provided by change in operating assets and liabilities of 2.0 million and non-cash charges totaling 0.3 million, which was primarily related to stock-based compensation and change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities was 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of net loss of 7.2 million and non-cash credits totaling 2.8 million, which was primarily related to change in fair value of warrant liabilities, partially offset by net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities, related to the purchases of property equipment, was less than 50 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities was 18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of gross proceeds from the Offering of 20.0 million, net of payment of issuance cost of 1.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to payment of financing costs related to a prior financing transaction.

 statements included elsewhere in this Report. Critical accounting estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements relate to accrued expenses and the fair value of stock-based compensation and warrants. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates and judgments since December 31, 2023. Refer to our 2023 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates and judgments. Recent accounting pronouncements Information regarding (i) adoption of new accounting standards and (ii) accounting standards issued but not yet adopted is included in Note 1. Business, basis of presentation, new accounting standards and summary of significant accounting policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable . Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer PEO and principal financial officer PFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our PEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report, as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are discussed further below. Previously identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting In connection with the preparation of the financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K, management identified the following material weaknesses: (i) lack of segregation of duties over cash disbursements and financial reporting, (ii) logical access over computer applications, and (iii) lack of supervision and review over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, there was a lack of segregation of duties involved in the execution of wire transfers, preparing journal entries, and review over clinical trial accruals, and certain individuals in the accounting department have administrative access to the financial reporting systems. See Remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses below for steps we are taking to correct these material weaknesses. 

 25 

Table of Contents NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Form 10-Q 
 Remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses Under the oversight of the audit committee, management has developed a detailed plan and timetable for the implementation of appropriate remedial measures to address the material weaknesses, as described above. We have taken the following actions to address the material weaknesses: we have added additional personnel to the accounting department to allow for increased segregation of duties; we have implemented a change management review process for access to systems used for financial reporting systems ; we have enhanced the controls over disbursements, separating the functions of initiating and approving to two separate individuals; and we have implemented enhanced controls relating to the review and oversight of financial reporting, including the preparation of journal entries, and clinical trial accruals. 
 As of the date of this Report, we have remediated the material weaknesses related to the (i) lack of segregation of duties over cash disbursements and (ii) logical access over certain of the computer applications. We are in the process of remediating, but have not yet remediated, the material weaknesses related to (i) lack of segregation of duties over financial reporting, (ii) logical access over one computer application, and (iii) lack of supervision and review over financial reporting. Management believes that we have made considerable progress toward remediation of the remaining material weaknesses for 2024. Inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, including our PEO and PFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Changes in internal control Over financial reporting Other than the remediation activities listed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising out of our ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any claims or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business and condensed consolidated financial statements. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Ite m 1A. Risk Factors Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K. Item 2.
