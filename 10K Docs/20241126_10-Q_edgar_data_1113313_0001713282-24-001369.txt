The Company had a working capital deficit of and an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. The Company has
incurred significant losses since inception. While the Company commenced revenue generating activities in the first quarter of 2023,
it will require funding from outside sources to implement its business development strategy. The Company has no firm commitments for
additional funding. The aggregation of these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of one year from the date these consolidated financial statements are made available. The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

 Failure
to obtain the ongoing support of stockholders and creditors may indicate that the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
on a going concern basis is inappropriate, in which case our assets and liabilities would need to be recognized at their liquidation
values. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts and liabilities that might arise from this uncertainty.

capital, government regulations, stock price, operating costs, capital costs, and other factors. Any statements contained herein that

 Our
fiscal year end is December 31. All information presented herein is based on the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and September 30, 2023. 

 Arvana 

 Arvana
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977, as Turinco, Inc. to engage in any legal undertaking. On July
24, 2006, Arvana changed its name from Turinco, Inc. to Arvana Inc. on the acquisition of Arvana Networks, Inc., a telecommunications
business. We discontinued efforts related to that business as of December 31, 2009. Arvana acquired Down 2 Fish Charters, LLC on February
3, 2023. Down2Fish was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on April 1, 2019. 

 Down2Fish
operates a Florida based fishing charter business that offers a range of curated maritime adventures that include inshore, offshore,
and custom charters for fishing enthusiasts, nature lovers and tourists. The business is operated from a private dock in Palmetto, Florida
that services the Tampa Bay area in addition to St Petersburg, Sarasota, Venice, Port Charlotte, and Clearwater. Down2Fish generates
its revenue from the sale and provision of fishing charter services. 

 Arvana
acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Down2Fish on February 3, 2023, from LCF Salons, LLC, in exchange for fifty thousand
dollars 50,000) and a promissory note in the amount of seven hundred thousand dollars 700,000) payable twenty-four (24) months after
the closing date that bears interest of seven and one quarter percent (7 per annum. Interest on the promissory note is payable
on an annual basis. 

 Stockholders
approved a forward stock split of Arvana s common shares on a 3-for-1 basis that was effected on April 19, 2023, to stockholders
of record on March 31, 2023. All changes in the capital structure have been given retroactive effect in this periodic report. 

Arvana s

Arvana
is traded on the OTC Markets Group, Inc. s Pink Sheets Current Information market platform under the symbol AVNI. 

While
Arvana operates its fishing charter business it has continued to seek business opportunities in real estate development. On December
12, 2023, Arvana announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire a Nevada-based company which is intent on expanding its
specialty use concept to acquire and repurpose vacant shopping malls, outlet locations, and big box stores to attract new tenants from
targeted industries that offer goods or services that are not available online. The parties have ended their discussions of the proposed
transaction, and management is evaluating alternative options for pursuing this business model. 

Plan
of Operation 

 Our
plan of operation is to support the development of our business, and to build on its existing business model. We believe that an expansion
of marketing efforts around Tampa Bay, to offer a wider range of services, such as dolphin tours, will help establish the Down2Fish brand,
attract more customers and increase revenues. Expansion into new service offerings will however require capital sufficient to finance
the purchase of another vessel and additional boating equipment. We believe that dolphin tours can return net revenue on a consistent
basis if we are able to attract sufficient customers to each excursion. We are currently licensed and equipped to carry no more than
six (6) customers on each fishing charter. A vessel designed primarily for dolphin tours can carry from fifty (50) to one hundred (100)
customers. Our primary impediment for equipment procurement and installation is cost. We are presently considering financing options
that might become available to us in the near term but have no assurance that financing options will become available or that if such
did become available, that the financing terms would be tenable for our business. Unless or until we can offer excursions that cater
to a greater number of customers on each excursion, we will continue to focus on offering more fishing charter excursions to build revenue
and improve our results of operations. 

 Results
of Operations 

 During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 Arvana raised capital to sustain operations, maintained its charter fishing business,
and evaluated other business opportunities.

results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three-month and nine-month

period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 42.0 , and as compared to 13,830 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024. Charter
revenue from operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 19,964 as compared to 23,634 for the comparable nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 15.5 , and as compared to 13,830 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024. Revenue
is comprised of fishing charter services. 

 We
expect charter revenue to taper off in the fourth quarter of 2024 as the fishing season comes to an end. 

Operating
Expenses 

 Operating
expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 are 101,770 as compared to 127,713 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 20.3 , and as compared to 152,239 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of 33.2 . Operating
expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 are 379,048 as compared to 405,267 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 6.5 . The changes in operating expenses over the comparative periods are attributed to reductions in general
and administrative expenses including share- based compensation, executive payroll, and auditing expenses. 

 We
expect operating expenses to increase in future periods as our business development strategies are implemented while auditing and accounting
professional fees are expected to increase over the next year. 

 Other
Expense 

 Other
expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 6,078 as compared to other expense of 4,522 for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2023, and as compared to other expense of 7,414 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024. Other expense for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 17,890 as compared to other expense of 781,763 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in other expense over the comparative periods can be primarily attributed to the loss recognized with the acquisition
of Down2Fish and interest expense offset by lease income realized in the current period. 

 We
expect to continue to recognize other expense in future periods as debt instruments tied to the fishing charter vessels continue to incur
interest and depreciation of our vessels continues. 

 Net
Loss 

 Net
loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 101,714 compared to net loss of 120,727 for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 15.7 . Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 376,974 compared to net loss
of 1,163,396 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 67.6 . The change in net loss over the comparative periods
can be primarily attributed to a decrease in losses from operating expenses and the loss recognized on the asset purchase of Down2Fish,
offset by the realization of revenue from charter boat services and other income that is generated through a lease of the charter vessels.

We
expect to continue to realize net losses from operations over the next twelve months as management works to implement its business model. 

18 

Capital
Expenditures 

 We expended no amounts on capital expenditures during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

 Since inception we have experienced significant changes in liquidity, capital resources, and stockholders' equity (deficit). 

 We had current assets of 9,357 as of September 30, 2024 consisting of cash and a bond as compared to current assets of 16,386 as of September 30, 2023 consisting of cash and a bond, and as compared to current assets of 27,171 as of December 31, 2023 consisting of cash and a bond. Total assets were
 178,600 as of September 30, 2024 consisting of current assets, property, equipment, and intangible assets as compared to total assets of 209,283 as of September 30, 2023 consisting of current assets, property, equipment, and intangible assets, and as compared to 216,549 as of December 31, 2023 consisting of current assets, property, equipment, and intangible assets.

We had current liabilities of 1,232,760 as of September 30, 2024 consisting of accounts payable, related- party payables, and the current portion of long-term debt as compared to current liabilities of 201,136 as of September 30, 2023 consisting of accounts payable, related-party payables, and the current portion of long-term debt, and as compared to current liabilities of 338,487 as of December 31, 2023 consisting of accounts payable, related-party payables, and the current portion of long-term debt. Total liabilities were
 1,366,988 as of September 30, 2024 consisting of current liabilities and notes payable net of current portion as compared to total liabilities of 1,080,720 as of September 30, 2023 consisting of current liabilities and notes payable net of current portion, and as compared to total liabilities of 1,178,675 as of December 31, 2023 consisting of current liabilities and notes payable net of current portion. The increase in current liabilities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is attributed to the transition of long-term debt due in connection with the acquisition of Down2Fish to current liabilities from the year ended December 31, 2023 in which it was classified as a long-term liability.

We had a working capital deficit of 1,223,403 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to a working capital deficit of 184,750 as of September 30, 2023, and as compared to a working capital deficit of 311,316 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in these deficits is primarily attributed to the transition of long-term debt due in connection with the acquisition of Down2Fish to current liabilities from the year ended December 31, 2023 in which it was classified as a long-term liability. 

 Net stockholders' deficit in Arvana is 1,188,052 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to a net stockholders' deficit of 871,437 as of September 30, 2023, and as compared to a net stockholders' deficit of 962,126 as of December 31, 2023. 

 Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

 Net
cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 3,439 as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of 148,773 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities can be attributed to
book expense items that do not affect the total amount relative to actual cash used such as depreciation expense, share-based compensation,
and loss on asset purchase. Balance sheet accounts that affect cash but are not income statement related items that are added or deducted
to arrive at net cash used in operating activities include current assets, accounts payable, and related-party payables. 

19 

We
expect to continue to have net cash flow used in operating activities over the next twelve months or until such time as Arvana generates
sufficient revenue from operations to sustain the costs of operations. 

 Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

 Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 0 as compared to net cash used in investing
activities of 51,654 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

 We
expect to use net cash in investing activities in the near term as investment will be required of us in connection with the expansion
our fishing charter business. 

 Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

 Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is 16,253 as compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of 61,348 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024 is attributed to payments on loans payable. Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine- month period
ended September 30, 2023 is attributed to the proceeds of loans payable offset by payments on loans payable. 

 We
expect to continue to use net cash provided by financing activities over the next twelve months generated through additional private
equity placements, public offerings, or private debt to fund continued expansion of our business. 

 Arvana s
assets are insufficient as of September 30, 2024 to implement its plan of operation to expand its business operations. We anticipate
conducting another private equity offering to meet our objectives and may seek additional loans in the short term to sustain operations.
Management is confident that its efforts to realize additional funding will be successful. 

 Arvana
does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

 Arvana
had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 

 Arvana
had no commitments for future capital expenditures at September 30, 2024. 

 Arvana
has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment. 

Arvana
has adopted the Arvana Inc. 2022 Stock Incentive Plan and had an employment agreement with its executive officer whose employment was
terminated effective July 17, 2024. The former executive officer did not exercise his vested options within the required 30-day period
resulting in the forfeiture of the options. Two members of the Board of Directors were removed effective July 17, 2024. Neither of these
members exercised their options within the 30-day period resulting in the forfeiture of their vested options. 

 Arvana
has no current plans to make any additional changes in the number of employees. 

 Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

 We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also
known as special purpose entities.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

 The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the
reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually review the estimates
and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently
uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is provided in Note
1 to the audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 which are included in our most recent Form 10-K.
In the notes we discuss accounting policies that are significant in determining the Company s results of operations and financial
position.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

 In
connection with the preparation of this quarterly report an evaluation was carried out by Arvana s management, with the participation
of the chief executive officer and the acting chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of Arvana s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act )) as of
September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its chief executive officer and the
chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

 Based
on that evaluation, Arvana s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that Arvana s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed within
the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and such information was accumulated and communicated to management,
including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

 Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 There
have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Arvana s internal control over
financial reporting.

 5. CYBERSECURITY 

Limited Risk
Management Strategy for Handling Sensitive Data 

Arvana is committed
to the integrity and security of the sensitive data that it collects, maintains, and transmits across its computer systems. Over the
ordinary course of our business, Arvana and its third party service providers (such as charter booking services) collect, maintain, and
transmit sensitive data including proprietary or confidential business information (such as operational data and personal information).
The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. 

Despite our efforts
to implement robust security measures in reliance on administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, our risk management strategies
and practices for protecting sensitive data are subject to certain limitations. A variety of factors give rise to these limitations including
the evolving nature of cyber threats, resource constraints, and the inherent risks associated with the technologies we and third party
service providers employ. Arvana relies on third parties including cloud vendors and consultants for various business functions. Many
of our third-party service providers have access to our information systems and data, and we rely on such third parties for the operation
of our business. We oversee third party service providers by conducting vendor diligence. Vendors are generally assessed for risk based
on the nature of their service, access to data, and systems and supply chain risk. 

Arvana s
current risk management strategy may not fully account for or mitigate the risks posed by emerging technologies or the potential impact
of these limitations on our business. Financial liabilities, damage to our reputation, and erosion of customer trust could negatively
affect our business operations and financial condition. 

 We
have adopted a cybersecurity governance structure to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats that include
a framework to respond to and assess internal and external threats to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Arvana s
data and information systems. Under which framework management is responsible for assessing and managing material risks that arise from
cybersecurity threats. We have not engaged third-party qualified contractors or claim any management expertise from which to draw in
the event of cybersecurity threats. 

 Governance
of Cybersecurity Issues 

 When
identified by management cybersecurity threats are to be immediately reported to Arvana s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee
has primary responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity threats once a cybersecurity threat has been reported to it by management.
Matters to be considered by the Audit Committee include management risks relating to data privacy, technology, and information security.
The Audit Committee must also consider Arvana s cyber security measures and the back-up of information systems, along with what
steps Arvana has taken to monitor and control cyber security exposure. Further, the Audit Committee is tasked with the responsibility
for conferring with management and Arvana s auditors as to the adequacy and effectiveness of information safeguards, cybersecurity
policies, and internal controls that impact information security. The Audit Committee will be briefed on any material cybersecurity incidents
that might adversely affect our business at least once each year, and such brief will include topics such as risk assessment, risk management,
control decisions, service provider arrangements, the occurrence of security incidents, and the responses to security incidents with
recommendations for changes or updates to policies and procedures. 

22 

While
Arvana has not experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, it cannot guarantee that our cybersecurity safeguards will prevent breaches
or breakdowns of our third-party service providers information technology systems, particularly in the face of continually evolving
cybersecurity threats and increasingly sophisticated threat actors. 

 A
cybersecurity incident could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation, in addition
to potentially subjecting us to government investigations, litigation, fines, or other damages.

6. OTHER INFORMATION
