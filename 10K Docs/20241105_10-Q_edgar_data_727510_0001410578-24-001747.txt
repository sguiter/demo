 million in gross proceeds. This has enabled the Company to embark on its plan to potentially realize the value of its more than million NOLs by acquiring businesses or assets. To protect the NOLs, in August 2020, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board adopted a Section 382 rights plan (See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Historically, the Company had received royalty revenues from licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to the sales of certain drug products that utilized Enzon s proprietary technology. In recent years, the Company has had no clinical operations and limited corporate operations. Enzon has a marketing agreement for the drug Vicineum, which, if approved, would, potentially, generate milestone and royalty payments to it in the future. Enzon cannot assure you that it will earn material future royalties or milestones. The Board and the Company s management are actively involved in pursuing, sourcing, reviewing and evaluating various potential acquisition transactions consistent with its strategy. The Company s management and Board have made a number of contacts and engaged in discussions with principals of individual companies and financial advisors on behalf of various individual companies, while continuing to evaluate potential transactions. To date, no acquisition candidates have been identified that are in an actionable state. The Company has a marketing agreement with Micromet AG, now part of Amgen, Inc. (the Micromet Agreement ), pursuant to which it may be entitled to certain milestone and royalty payments if Vicineum, a drug that was being developed by Sesen, Inc., Sesen is approved for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Sesen announced that it had completed a merger with Carisma Therapeutics Inc. Carisma ), had paused further development of Vicineum in the United States, and had withdrawn its application to market Vicineum in Europe. Sesen also announced that the combined company will focus on the advancement of Carisma s proprietary cell therapy for the treatment of cancer and other disorders, and it intends to seek a partner for any further development of Vicineum. The Company receives an annual license maintenance fee of approximately from Amgen, Inc. in payment of a worldwide, royalty-free non-exclusive right to license Vicineum. The fee represents half of the amount paid by Viventia Biotech (Barbados) Inc. Viventia ), part of Sesen, on an annual basis for the continued right to license Vicineum. The Company received the license maintenance fee during the second quarter of 2024. In August 2020, the Board adopted a Section 382 rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of right for each outstanding share of the Company s common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. (See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) In September 2020, the Board approved a Rights Offering (the Rights Offering ), by which the Company distributed, at no charge to all holders of its common stock on September 23, 2020 (the Record Date ), transferable subscription rights to purchase units Units at a subscription price per Unit of . In the Rights Offering, each stockholder on the Record Date received subscription right for every share of common stock owned on the Record Date. For every subscription rights held, a stockholder was entitled to purchase Unit at the subscription price. Each Unit consisted of share of newly designated Series C Preferred Stock, par value per share, and shares of the Company s common stock. The subscription period for the Rights Offering ended on October 9, 2020. As a result of the sale of all Units available for purchase in the Rights Offering, the Company received approximately million of gross proceeds and had shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding and an aggregate of shares of common stock outstanding following the Rights Offering.

 of income tax expense. During the comparable period in 2023, the Company recorded approximately of income tax expense. The income tax expense in 2024 was mainly related to the reduction of the net deferred tax asset due to the utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainties, including future interest rates, whether or when an acquisition of a profitable entity will come to fruition and other factors, projecting long-term future performance of the Company is problematical. Accordingly, the Company is only projecting pre-tax book income through September 30, 2025 due to interest rates on its short-term cash investments and the absence of any potentially actionable acquisitions at this time. Upon review of positive and negative evidence in determining a partial reversal of the valuation allowance, the Company has concluded that a partial reversal of the valuation allowance is necessary. Interest rates may fluctuate throughout the period through September 30, 2025. However, the Company does not expect them to return to low rates of the past creating a projected taxable income position. Accordingly, a deferred tax expense of approximately and was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company may acquire businesses, entities or revenue streams that could generate sufficient income so that it can utilize its approximately million NOL. To date, no acquisition candidates have been identified that are in an actionable state and, while the Company may ultimately be successful in realizing some or all of the value of its NOLs, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to realize any value of its NOLs. Management of the Company will continue to assess the need for this valuation allowance and will make adjustments when or if appropriate. At September 30, 2024, the Company had federal NOLs of approximately million, of which approximately million will expire in the years 2025 through 2036, and New Jersey state NOLs of approximately million that expire in the years 2031 through 2042. At September 30, 2024, the Company has federal research and development R D credit carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years 2024 through 2029. These deferred tax assets were subject to a valuation allowance such that the deferred tax expense incurred as a result of the expiration of the R D credit carryforwards was offset by a corresponding deferred tax benefit for the related reduction in valuation allowance. The Company s ability to use the NOLs and R D tax credit carryforwards may be limited, as they are subject to certain limitations due to ownership changes as defined by rules pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. However, management of the Company believes that the Company s NOLs will not be limited by any changes in the Company s ownership as a result of the successful completion of the Rights Offering. (See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) Additionally, in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on the Company s ability to use its NOLs, the Board adopted a Section 382 rights plan. (See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.

 , based primarily on Merck s assertions regarding recoupments related to prior returns and rebates. Merck has not yet reported 2024 royalty revenue earned by the Company for product sales and/or recoupments for returns and rebates. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net payable to Merck of approximately due to such royalty overpayment claims by Merck. The Company believes that it will receive no additional royalties from Merck, as all of the relevant patents have expired. Other right for each outstanding share of the Company s common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. Accordingly, holders of the Company s common stock own preferred stock purchase right for each share of common stock owned by such holder. The rights are not immediately exercisable and will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Section 382 rights plan. If the rights become exercisable, each right would initially represent the right to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company s Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value per share, for a purchase price of per right. If issued, each fractional share of Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does share of the Company s common stock. However, prior to exercise, a right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including any dividend, voting or liquidation rights. The rights would have expired on the earliest of (i) the close of business on June 2, 2024, which date has been extended to March 31, 2025 by the Board and ratified by the stockholders vote at the Company s annual meeting, (ii) the time at which the rights are redeemed or exchanged under the Section 382 rights plan, (iii) the close of business on the day of repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor statute or (iv) the close of business on the first day of a taxable year of the Company to which the Company s Board determines that no NOLs may be carried forward. subscription rights held, a stockholder was entitled to purchase Unit at the subscription price of . Each Unit consisted of share of newly designated Series C Preferred Stock, par value per share, and shares of the Company s common stock. On October 9, 2020, the Rights Offering expired and, as a result of the sale of all Units, the Company received approximately million in gross proceeds and issued shares of Series C Preferred Stock and shares of common stock such that, following the closing of the Rights Offering, there was an aggregate of shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding and shares of common stock outstanding.

 of the liquidation preference as in effect at such time (initially per share). If the dividend is not so paid in cash, the liquidation preference is adjusted and increased annually by an amount equal to of the liquidation preference per share as in effect at such time, that is not paid in cash to the holders on such date. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights and the Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. The initial liquidation value of the Series C Preferred Stock was per share. At December 31, 2021 the liquidation value of the Series C Preferred Stock was per share, inasmuch as no dividend was declared or paid in cash. On December 29, 2022, the Board declared a cash dividend of on the Series C Preferred Stock, aggregating approximately or per share. Accordingly, the liquidation value of the Series C Preferred Stock was per share on December 31, 2022. The dividend was paid on January 17, 2023 to the holders of record of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock as of January 10, 2023. On December 28, 2023, the Board declared a cash dividend of on the Series C Preferred Stock, aggregating approximately or per share.

The dividend was paid on January 17, 2024 to the holders of record of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock as of January 10, 2024. Since November 1, 2022, the Company is able to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, for an amount based on the liquidation preference per share as in effect at such time. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have the right to demand that the Company redeem their shares in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the Certificate of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock. shares of Series C Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of million. As of December 31, 2021, the Board had not declared a cash dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a increase to the liquidation preference of approximately per share of Series C Preferred Stock, aggregating approximately , for a cumulative liquidation value of approximately per share) as of December 31, 2021. Because a cash dividend of was declared for each of 2023 and 2022, at December 31, 2023 and 2022 there was no change to the liquidation value that was recorded as of December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, the Board had not yet determined whether to declare a cash dividend at the end of 2024. Accordingly, the Company accrued an accretion at for the 2024 nine-month period on a pro rata basis (approximately or per share) and, as a result, the liquidation value of the Series C Preferred Stock was approximately per share) at September 30, 2024. There is no prohibition on the repurchase or redemption of Series C Preferred Shares while there is any arrearage in the payment of dividends. Since the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock is contingently or optionally redeemable, unless and until the Company undertakes a change of control, the Series C Preferred Stock has been classified in mezzanine equity on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Enzon, the Company, we, us, or our and similar terms mean Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended. Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in the following discussion, other than statements that are purely historical, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, potential, anticipates, plans, or intends or the negative thereof, or other variations thereof, or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements are based upon management s present expectations, objectives, anticipations, plans, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, events or developments to be materially different from those indicated in such forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended and include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties: We may be unsuccessful in our strategy to fully utilize our NOLs and other tax assets (which may expire unutilized) and enhance stockholder value as a public company acquisition vehicle. Our sources of revenue are limited and, as a result of our cash reserves, we expect only limited revenue and profitability for the foreseeable future. In prior years, we derived most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in sharp decline in the recent past. Our right to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron in all jurisdictions have expired as of February 2024. Our only remaining right to receive royalties relates to Vicineum for which our licensee has stopped development. We currently do not anticipate any royalties from other sources, but we may acquire new sources of royalty revenues. We have reallocated all employment responsibilities and outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions. We may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our previously conducted clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. Our revenues largely depend on proprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection against the development of competing products. We are party to license agreements whereby we may receive royalties and or milestone payments from products subject to regulatory approval. The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our common stock is low and our stockholders ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, as well as the requirements of the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our fulfillment of the conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock, fluctuating royalty revenues, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.

Table of Contents 
 We have adopted a Section 382 rights plan, which may discourage a corporate takeover. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. The terms of our outstanding Series C Preferred Stock and the issuance of additional series of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of our common stockholders. The interests of our significant stockholders may conflict with the interests of other stockholders. If we experience an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to fully utilize our NOLs on an annual basis will be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the NOLs could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of those benefits. If we experience a Change of Control, as defined in Certificate of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have the right, at such holder s option, to require the Company to redeem at the Liquidation Preference then in effect all or a portion of such holder s shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which would negatively impact our available cash. 
 A more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect results is contained in our filings with the SEC, including in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended and Item 1 A. Risk Factors herein. These risks and uncertainties and other factors should be considered carefully and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. As such, no assurance can be given that the future results covered by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. All information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is as of the date of this report, unless otherwise indicated, and we undertake no duty to update this information. The percentage changes throughout the following discussion are based on amounts stated in thousands of dollars and not the rounded millions of dollars reflected in this section. Overview During 2020, the Company adopted a Section 382 rights plan and completed a Rights Offering, each as further described below. As a result of the successful completion of the Rights Offering, we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and potentially utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholder value. We may acquire businesses, entities or revenue streams that could generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our approximately 101.6 million of federal NOLs. To date, no acquisition candidates have been identified that are in an actionable state and, while we may be successful in realizing the value of our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. Prior to 2017, the primary source of our royalty revenues was derived from sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck. We currently have no clinical operations and limited corporate operations. We have no intention of resuming any clinical development activities. We had no revenues from sales of PegIntron for the year ended December 31, 2023 or the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. We have a marketing agreement with Micromet AG, now part of Amgen, Inc. (the Micromet Agreement ), pursuant to which we may be entitled to certain milestone and royalty payments if Vicineum, a drug that was being developed by Sesen, Inc., (Sesen is approved for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Sesen announced that it had completed a merger with Carisma Therapeutics Inc. Carisma ), had paused further development of Vicineum in the United States, had withdrawn its application to market Vicineum in Europe and that the combined company will focus on the advancement of Carisma s proprietary cell therapy for the treatment of cancer and other disorders and that it intends to seek a partner for any further development of Vicineum. Due to the challenges associated with developing and obtaining approval for drug products, and the lack of our involvement in the development and approval process, there is substantial uncertainty as to whether we will receive any milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Agreement. We will not recognize revenue until all revenue recognition requirements are met. We may be entitled to certain potential future milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory approval-related milestones by third-party licensees. We cannot assure you that we will receive any milestone payments resulting from our agreements with any of our third-party licensees or that any sales of related products will be made. We will not recognize revenue from any of our third-party licensees until all revenue recognition requirements are met.

 Acquisition Activities Our Board and our management are actively involved in pursuing, sourcing, reviewing and evaluating various potential acquisition transactions consistent with our long-term strategy. Our management and Board have made a number of contacts and engaged in discussions with principals of individual companies and financial advisors on behalf of various individual companies, while continuing to evaluate potential transactions. To date, we have not developed any actionable transactions. We will continue to update our stockholders as material developments arise. Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis, the primary focus is on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The percentage changes throughout the following discussion are based on amounts stated in thousands of dollars. Results of Operations Revenues: License Fees: In the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we had no revenue from license fees, and in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we earned approximately 26,000 in license fees. In the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we had no revenue from license fees. Interest and Dividend Income (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Interest and dividend income 654 5 622 1,906 18 1,622 Interest and dividend income is attributable to the interest and dividends received on the invested cash and cash equivalents we received primarily from the 46.6 million of proceeds from our rights offering (See Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest and dividend income increased by approximately 32,000, or 5 , to 654,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 622,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income is attributable to the higher rates of interest in the 2024 period compared to the same period in 2023. Interest and dividend income increased by approximately 284,000, or 18 , to 1,906,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,622,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income is attributable to the higher rates of interest in 2024. Operating Expenses: General and Administrative (in thousands of dollars, except percentages): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 General and administrative 351 56 225 1,028 24 828 General and administrative expenses increased by approximately 126,000, or 56 , to 351,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 225,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense is substantially attributable to an increase in professional fees and insurance. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately 200,000, or 24 , to 1,028,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 828,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense is substantially attributable to an increase in professional fees and insurance.

 Tax Expense : Assuming no acquisition is completed or material changes in results through September 2025, the Company has partially reversed the valuation allowances as of September 30, 2024. Deferred tax expenses of 53,000 and 91,000, respectively were recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) Liquidity and Capital Resources Our current source of liquidity is our existing cash on hand, which includes the approximately 43.6 million of gross proceeds from our Rights Offering and the interest earned on that amount. (See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.) While we no longer have any research and development activities, we continue to retain rights to receive fees, royalties and milestone payments from existing licensing arrangements with other companies and, accordingly, we may be entitled to a share of milestone and royalty payments from our few remaining licensed patents. We believe that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations, at least, through November 2025. Our future royalty revenues are expected to be de minimis over the forseeable future and we cannot assure you that we will receive any royalty, milestone or other revenues. While we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholder value, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in making acquisitions that are profitable and that will enable us to utilize our NOLs. Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted for certain non-cash items including the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 896,000, as compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately 850,000 during the comparable period in 2023. The increase of approximately 46,000 was primarily attributable to the increase in interest and dividend income of approximately 284,000, increasing to approximately 1,906,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 1,622,000 during the comparable period in 2023, partially offset by the increase of approximately 200,000 in general and administrative expenses, increasing to approximately 1,028,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 828,000 during the comparable period in 2023. Cash used in financing activities represents cash dividends of approximately 1,275,000 paid to holders of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock in each of the periods. The net effect of the foregoing was a decrease of cash and cash equivalents of approximately 400,000 from approximately 47.0 million at December 31, 2023 to approximately 46.6 million at September 30, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually limited purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP. All applicable U.S. GAAP accounting standards effective as of September 30, 2024 have been taken into consideration in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Some of those estimates are subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. The following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 
 We base our estimates, to the extent possible, on historical experience. Historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary. Actual results could differ from our estimates. Income Taxes Under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2024, we believe, based on our projections, that a partial reversal of the valuation allowance is necessary. Interest rates may fluctuate throughout 2024 and during the first half of 2025, however, they are not expected to return to low rates of the past creating a projected taxable income position. Therefore, the Company will partially reverse the valuation allowances. We are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and potentially utilize our NOLs. We may acquire businesses, entities or revenue streams that could generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our approximately 101.6 million of federal NOLs. At this time, however, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so. Accordingly, our management will continue to assess the need for this valuation allowance and will make adjustments when appropriate. Additionally, our management believes that our NOLs will not be limited by any changes in our ownership as a result of the successful completion of the Rights Offering (See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain our position. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide information required by this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, consisting of Richard L. Feinstein who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Part II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not currently a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us or our business.
