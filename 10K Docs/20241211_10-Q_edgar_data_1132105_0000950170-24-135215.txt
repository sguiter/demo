 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this 10-Q contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements concern our business, operations and financial performance and condition as well as our plans, objectives and expectations for our business operations and financial performance and condition, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These statements may include words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, can have, could, due, estimate, expect, goal, intend, likely, may, objective, plan, positioned, potential, predict, should, target, will, would and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events or trends. For example, all statements we make relating to our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives and strategies are forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and our management s beliefs and assumptions. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that predicting the impact of known factors is very difficult, and we cannot anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. 
 All of our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: 
 current and future government regulations, in particular regulations relating to the sale of firearms and ammunition, which may impact the supply and demand for our products and our ability to conduct our business; 

our retail-based business model which is impacted by general economic and market conditions and economic, market and financial uncertainties that may cause a decline in consumer spending; 

our concentration of stores in the Western United States which makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region, and could affect our sales and cause our operating results to suffer; 

the highly fragmented and competitive industry in which we operate and the potential for increased competition; 

changes in consumer demands, including regional preferences, which we may not be able to identify and respond to in a timely manner; 

our entrance into new markets or operations in existing markets, including our plans to open additional stores in future periods, which may not be successful; 

our implementation of a plan to reduce expenses in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, including an increased focus on financial discipline and rigor throughout our organization; and 

the impact of general macroeconomic conditions, such as labor shortages, inflation, elevated interest rates, economic slowdowns, and recessions or market corrections. 

The above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, and we cannot predict all of them. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements disclosed under Part I., Item 1A., Risk Factors, appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K and Part I., Item 2., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this 10-Q and otherwise in the context of these risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements we make. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this 10-Q and are not guarantees of future performance or developments and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in many cases beyond our control. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements publicly, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of the Company s leases, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The Company s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The operating lease asset also includes any fixed lease payments made and includes lease incentives and incurred initial direct costs. Operating lease expense for fixed lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those which are discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I., Item 1A. of our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. Also see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I. of this 10-Q. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected or achieved for any future period. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 We are an outdoor sporting goods retailer focused on meeting the everyday needs of the seasoned outdoor veteran, the first-time participant and everyone in between. Our mission is to provide outstanding gear and exceptional service to inspire outdoor memories. 
 Our business was founded in 1986 as a single retail store in Midvale, Utah. Today, we operate 146 stores in 32 states, totaling approximately 5.4 million gross square feet. We also operate an e-commerce platform at www.sportsmans.com. We do not incorporate the information on or accessible through our website into this 10-Q, and you should not consider any information on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this 10-Q. 
 Our stores and our e-commerce platform are aggregated into one operating and reportable segment. 
 Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 Our financial results and operations have been, and will continue to be, impacted by events outside of our control. 
 Global economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including labor shortages, inflation and monetary supply shifts, elevated interest rates, recession risks and potential disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising global political tensions. Our results may also be impacted by the upcoming change in the presidential administration. In fiscal year 2023 and continuing into fiscal year 2024 our business was impacted by consumer inflationary pressures and recession concerns. As a result of our recent performance, we have taken steps to reduce our total inventory, implement cost reduction measures to reflect current sales trends and reduce investments in future new store openings. We currently do not plan to open any new stores for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and we plan to open one new store in fiscal year 2025. 
 
 We continue to actively monitor the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. The extent of the impact of these factors on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected timeframe, will depend on future developments, and the impact on our customers, partners and employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted; however, any continued or renewed disruption resulting from these factors could negatively impact our business. 
 How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are net sales, same store sales, gross margin, selling, general, and administrative expenses, income from operations and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA ).

Table of Contents 

 Net Sales and Same Store Sales 
 
 Our net sales are primarily received from revenue generated in our stores and also include sales generated through our e-commerce platform. When measuring revenue generated from our stores, we review our same store sales as well as the performance of our stores that have not operated for a sufficient amount of time and include each in same store sales. We include net sales from a store in same store sales on the first day of the 13 th full fiscal month following the store s grand opening or acquisition by us. We exclude sales from stores that were closed during the period from our same store sales calculation. We include net sales from e-commerce in our calculation of same store sales. For fiscal years consisting of 53 weeks, we exclude net sales during the 53 rd week from our calculation of same store sales. Some of our competitors and other retailers may calculate same store sales differently than we do. As a result, data regarding our same store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. 
 
 Measuring the change in year-over-year same store sales allows us to evaluate how our retail store base is performing. Various factors affect same store sales, including: 
 macroeconomic factors, political trends, social unrest, inflationary pressures, recessionary trends, labor shortages, monetary supply shifts, elevated interest rates, tightening of credit markets, and potential disruptions from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising global political tensions; 

consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; 

changes or anticipated changes to laws and government regulations related to some of the products we sell, in particular regulations relating to the sale of firearms and ammunition; 

our ability to identify and respond effectively to local and regional trends and customer preferences; 

our ability to provide quality customer service that will increase our conversion of shoppers into paying customers; 

the success of our omni-channel strategy and our e-commerce platform; 

competition in the regional market of a store; 

atypical weather; 

new product introductions and changes in our product mix; and 

changes in pricing and average ticket sales. 

We operate in a complex regulatory and legal environment that could negatively impact the demand for our products, which could significantly affect our operations and financial results. State, local and federal laws and regulations relating to products that we sell may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political, economic or social events. For instance, in November 2022, the State of Oregon passed legislation that will, among other things, impose complex permitting and training requirements for the purchases of firearms. As a result, sales of firearms in Oregon may be halted or substantially diminished until such permitting and training programs are developed by the state, which may take a significant amount of time. If that were to occur, it could result in a substantial decline in our sales of firearms and related products and reduce traffic to our stores in Oregon, which could have a substantial impact on our sales and gross margin. A state court judge in Oregon ruled that the measure violates the Oregon state constitution. This ruling is currently being appealed in the Oregon Court of Appeals. The measure is also being challenged in a related case in federal court and is currently on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We currently operate eight stores in the State of Oregon. 
 
 Opening new stores and acquiring store locations is also an important part of our long-term growth strategy. During fiscal year 2023, we opened 15 new stores. We have not opened any new stores in fiscal year 2024 and do not plan to open any new stores for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. We plan to open one new store in fiscal year 2025. We may deviate from this target if attractive opportunities are presented to open stores or acquire new store locations outside of our target growth rate. 
 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 We also have been scaling our e-commerce platform and increasing sales through our website, www.sportsmans.com . 
 
 We believe the key drivers to increasing our total net sales include: 
 increasing and improving same store sales in our existing markets; 

increasing our total gross square footage by opening new stores and through strategic acquisitions; 

increasing customer visits to our stores and improving our conversion rate through focused marketing efforts and continually high standards of customer service; 

expanding our omni-channel capabilities through larger assortment and inventory, expanded content and expertise and better user experience; and 

growing our loyalty and credit card programs. 

Gross Margin 
 Gross profit consists of our net sales less cost of goods sold. Gross margin measures our gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Our cost of goods sold primarily consists of merchandise acquisition costs, including freight-in costs, shipping costs, payment term discounts received from the vendor and vendor allowances and rebates associated directly with merchandise and shipping costs related to e-commerce sales. 
 
 We believe the key drivers to improving our gross margin are increasing the product mix to higher margin products, particularly apparel and footwear, increasing foot traffic within our stores and traffic to our website, improving buying opportunities with our vendor partners and coordinating pricing strategies among our stores and our merchandise group. Our ability to properly manage our inventory can also impact our gross margin. Successful inventory management ensures we have sufficient high margin products in stock at all times to meet customer demand, while overstocking of items could lead to markdowns in order to help a product sell. During fiscal year 2023, we commenced an effort to reduce our inventory and initiated various strategic promotional efforts as part of this plan, which impacted our gross margins during fiscal year 2023. At the end of fiscal year 2023, we completed our inventory reduction plan. For fiscal year 2024, high inflation has continued to adversely impact our gross margins. We believe that the overall growth of our business can also help improve our gross margins, because increased merchandise volumes will enable us to maintain our strong relationships with our vendors. If we see significant declines in sales or increases in overstocked inventory, we may experience a decline in gross margins as we use promotions to drive traffic and reduce inventory. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 We closely manage our selling, general, and administrative expenses. Our selling, general, and administrative expenses are comprised of payroll, rent and occupancy, depreciation and amortization, acquisition expenses, pre-opening expenses and other operating expenses, including stock-based compensation expense. Pre-opening expenses include expenses incurred in the preparation and opening of a new store location, such as payroll, travel and supplies, but do not include the cost of the initial inventory or capital expenditures required to open a location. 
 Our selling, general, and administrative expenses are primarily influenced by the volume of net sales of our locations, except for our corporate payroll, rent and occupancy and depreciation and amortization, which are generally fixed in nature. We control our selling, general, and administrative expenses through a budgeting and reporting process that allows our personnel to adjust our expenses as trends in net sales activity are identified. 
 Income from Operations 
 Income from operations is gross profit less selling, general, and administrative expenses. We use income from operations as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus interest expense (benefit), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, transition and severance costs related to director and officer transitions, and other gains, losses and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. In evaluating our business, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as additional measurement tools for purposes of business decision-making, including evaluating store performance, developing budgets and managing expenditures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Thirteen Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net Sales and Same Store Sales. Net sales decreased by 16.3 million, or 4.8 , to 324.3 million during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 340.6 million in the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Our net sales decreased primarily due to the continued impact of consumer inflationary pressures on discretionary spending, resulting in a decline in store traffic and lower demand, particularly in ammunition, and across our Apparel and Footwear departments. This decrease was partially offset by net sales growth in our Fishing, Optics, Electronics, Accessories and Other and Camping departments. Stores that have been open for less than 12 months and were, therefore, not included in our same store sales, contributed 4.0 million to net sales. E-commerce driven sales comprised more than 18 of total sales for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. Same store sales decreased by 5.7 during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal year 2023, primarily as a result of inflationary pressures on consumer discretionary spending. 
 
 Our Optics, Electronics, Accessories and Other, Fishing and Camping departments saw net sales increases of 1.7 million, 1.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively, during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023 primarily driven by our reset of fishing inventory and the opening of 1 new store since October 28, 2023. Our Apparel, Footwear and Hunting and Shooting departments saw net sales decreases of 10.3 million, 6.6 million and 2.2 million, respectively, during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Within our Hunting and Shooting department, our ammunition and firearm categories saw decreases of 5.9 million and 0.7 million or 10.7 and 1.1 , respectively, during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. The 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 decreases in the firearm and ammunition categories were primarily due to the impact of consumer inflationary pressures on discretionary spending. This was partially offset by our opening of 1 new store since October 28, 2023. 
 
 With respect to same store sales, during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, our Fishing and Optics, Electronics, Accessories and Other departments saw increases of 3.2 and 2.6 , respectively, compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Our Apparel, Footwear, Hunting and Shooting and Camping departments saw same store sales decreases of 28.3 , 25.4 , 2.0 and 0.4 , respectively, during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. These changes were primarily driven by the items noted above for net sales. As of November 2, 2024, 145 stores were included in our same store sales calculation. 
 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.1 , to 103.1 million during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 103.2 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 31.8 during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 30.3 for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by increased product margins in our Apparel and Footwear departments, partially offset by increased freight and shrink. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.1 , to 100 million during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 100.1 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of decreases in payroll, pre-opening and depreciation expenses of 0.9 million, 0.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. These reductions were primarily related to increased operational efficiencies and the decision to not open new stores during the current fiscal year. The decreases were offset by an increase of 0.9 million in rent expense, primarily as a result of inflation, and a 1.8 million legal settlement during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. 
 
 On a per store basis, our payroll expense decreased approximately 3 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. On a per store basis, our other operating expenses increased approximately 2 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023 as we increased marketing spend to help drive sales. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 30.8 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to 29.4 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, as a result of the factors discussed above. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by 0.6 million, or 15.4 , to 3.3 million during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 3.9 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by decreased gross borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes. We recognized income tax expense of 0.2 million during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of 0.5 million during the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rates during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 were -80.2 and -52.6 , respectively. Our effective tax rate will generally differ from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21.0 , due to state taxes, permanent items, and discrete items relating to stock award deductions. 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 Compared to Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net Sales and Same Store Sales. Net sales decreased by 60.4 million, or 6.6 , to 857.2 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 917.6 million in the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Our net sales decreased primarily due to the continued impact of consumer inflationary pressures on discretionary spending, resulting in a decline in store traffic and lower demand across most product categories. This decrease was partially offset by same store sales growth in our Fishing department and our opening of 1 new store since October 28, 2023. Stores that have been open for less than 12 months and were, therefore, not included in our same store sales, contributed 30.8 million to net sales. E-commerce driven sales comprised more than 19 of total sales for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024. Same store sales decreased by 9.4 during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024

 compared to the corresponding 39-week period of fiscal year 2023, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above that impacted net sales. 
 
 Our Fishing department saw a net sales increase of 7.6 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023 primarily driven by our reset of fishing inventory and the opening of 1 new store since October 28, 2023. Our Hunting and Shooting, Apparel, Footwear, Camping and Optics, Electronics, Accessories and Other departments saw net sales decreases of 31.4 million, 17.3 million, 14.4 million, 3.7 million and 1.2 million, respectively, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Within our Hunting and Shooting department, our ammunition and firearm categories saw decreases of 18.7 million and 12.6 million or 12.9 and 5.9 , respectively, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. The decreases in the firearm and ammunition categories were primarily due to the impact of consumer inflationary pressures on discretionary spending. This was partially offset by our opening of 1 new store since October 28, 2023. 
 
 With respect to same store sales, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, our Fishing department saw an increase of 4.8 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Our Apparel, Footwear, Hunting and Shooting, Camping and Optics, Electronics, Accessories and Other departments saw same store sales decreases of 24.8 , 23.8 , 9.1 , 5.6 and 5.3 , respectively, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. These changes were primarily driven by the items noted above for net sales. As of November 2, 2024, 145 stores were included in our same store sales calculation. 
 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 17.2 million, or 6.0 , to 266.9 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 284 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 31.1 during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 31.0 for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by increased product margins, versus last years Apparel and Footwear clearance events which put pressure on gross margin, partially offset by increased shrink. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 12.7 million, or 4.2 , to 288.7 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 301.5 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of decreases in payroll and pre-opening expenses of 11.6 million and 5.4 million, respectively, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 primarily related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts and decision to not open new stores during the current fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 4.1 million and 2.1 million in rent and depreciation expenses, respectively, during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 primarily as a result of opening 1 new store since October 28, 2023. 
 
 On a per store basis, our payroll and other operating expenses decreased approximately 13 and 5 , respectively, compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 33.6 of net sales during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 32.9 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by lower net sales. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by 0.1 million, or 1.1 , to 9.4 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to 9.5 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by decreased gross borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes. We recognized income tax benefit of 7.4 million during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 6.7 million during the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rates during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 were 23.2 and 24.8 , respectively. Our effective tax rate will generally differ from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21.0 , due to state taxes, permanent items, and discrete items relating to stock award deductions.

 Seasonality 
 Net sales are typically higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters than in our first and second fiscal quarters because of the openings of hunting seasons across the country and consumer holiday buying patterns. We also incur additional expenses in our third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher sales volume and increased staffing in our stores. We anticipate our net sales will continue to reflect this seasonal pattern. 
 The timing of our new retail store openings also may have an impact on our quarterly results. First, we incur certain non-recurring expenses related to opening each new retail store, which are expensed as they are incurred. Second, most store expenses generally vary proportionately with net sales, but there is also a fixed cost component, which includes occupancy costs. These fixed costs typically result in lower store profitability during the initial period after a new retail store opens. Due to both of these factors, new retail store openings may result in a temporary decline in operating profit, in dollars and/or as a percentage of net sales. 
 Weather conditions affect outdoor activities and the demand for related apparel and equipment. Customers demand for our products, and, therefore, our net sales, can be significantly impacted by weather patterns on a local, regional and national basis. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview; Uses and Sources of Cash 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.7 million and working capital, consisting of current assets less current liabilities, of 75.8 million. We also had 148.1 million available for borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility and our term loan facility as of November 2, 2024, calculated based upon certain borrowing base restrictions for each of the revolving credit facility and term loan facility. 
 
 Our primary cash requirements are for seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures related to ongoing operational needs and new system investments. For both the short-term and the long-term, our primary sources of cash are borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility, our term loan facility and operating cash flows. We believe that our cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility will be sufficient to finance our operating activities and meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and beyond. With no new stores planned for the remainder of fiscal year 2024, and only one new store planned for fiscal year 2025, we intend to prioritize the repayment of outstanding debt with any excess cash flow. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations are primarily for general operating expenses and other expenses discussed below. 
 Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery. We or the vendor can generally terminate the purchase orders at any time. These purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled. 
 Operating Lease Obligations. Operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our retail stores, corporate office and distribution center. Our leases often include options which allow us to extend the terms beyond the initial lease term. As of November 2, 2024, our expected operating lease payments for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 are 18.7 million and 72.8 million, respectively. Our total committed lease payments are 471.3 million. Other operating lease obligations consist of distribution center equipment. See Note 6, Leases to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this 10-Q. 
 Capital Expenditures. During the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, we incurred approximately 11.3 million in capital expenditures primarily related to strategic technological investments and general store maintenance. We expect capital expenditures, net of tenant allowances, between 17 million and 20 million for fiscal year 2024 (inclusive of amounts spent during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024) primarily related to strategic 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 technological investments, such as planogramming, merchandising and replenishment and store scheduling tools, and general store fleet maintenance. We intend to fund these capital expenditures with our operating cash flows, cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility. Other investment opportunities, such as potential strategic acquisitions or store expansion rates in excess of those presently planned, may require additional funding. 
 Principal and Interest Payments. We maintain a 350.0 million revolving credit facility and a 45.0 million term loan facility. As of November 2, 2024, 145.7 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and 25.0 million was outstanding under the term loan facility. Assuming no additional repayments or borrowings on our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility after November 2, 2024, our interest payments would be approximately 3.0 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and approximately 12.0 million for fiscal year 2025, in each case, based on the interest rate as of November 2, 2024. As of November 2, 2024, our weighted average interest rate on the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility was 7.02 . See below under Indebtedness for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility and term loan facility, including the interest rates applicable to any borrowing under such facilities. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities are shown in the following table:

Net cash used in operating activities was 18.7 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities was 16.6 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023, an increase of approximately 2.1 million. The increase in our cash flows used in operating activities was primarily driven by reduced net income during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 11.3 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities was 71.2 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023, a decrease of approximately 59.9 million, which was primarily driven by reduced capital expenditures related to the construction of new stores and the refurbishment of existing stores during the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 29.4 million for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities was 88.3 million for the corresponding period of fiscal year 2023, a decrease of approximately 58.9 million. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of decreased incremental borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 Indebtedness 
 We maintain a 350.0 million revolving credit facility, with 145.7 million outstanding as of November 2, 2024. Our revolving credit facility is governed by an amended and restated credit agreement with a consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ). We additionally entered into a term loan credit facility on July 30, 2024 with an aggregate principal amount available of 45.0 million, with 25.0 million outstanding as of November 2, 2024. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation. As of November 2, 2024, we had an aggregate amount of 148.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility, calculated based upon certain borrowing base restrictions, and 2.0 million in stand-by commercial letters of credit. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on either the base rate or Term SOFR (as defined by the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility), at our option, in each case plus an applicable margin. The base rate is the greatest of (1) the floor rate (as defined in the credit agreement as a rate of interest equal to 0.0 (2) Wells Fargo s prime rate, (3) the federal funds rate (as defined in the applicable credit agreement) plus 0.50 or (4) the one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the applicable credit agreement) plus 1.00 . The applicable margin for loans under the revolving credit facility, which varies based on the average daily availability, ranges from 0.25 to 0.50 per year for base rate loans and from 1.35 to 1.60 per year for Term SOFR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which will range from 0.20 to 0.225 per annum, depending on the average daily availability under the revolving credit facility. 
 Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at a rate equal to (i) a specified term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), plus (ii) 0.10 as a SOFR adjustment, plus (iii) the applicable margin as specified in the Term Loan. The applicable margin means either 3.50 or 6.50 depending on the type of term loan. Under the Term Loan, loans may be required to be converted to base rate loans and in such case, the applicable margin rate will increase by 1.0 . 
 Each of the subsidiaries of Holdings is a borrower under the revolving credit facility and the term loan, and all obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan are guaranteed by Holdings. All of the obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan are secured by a lien on substantially all of Holdings assets and assets of all of Holdings subsidiaries, including a pledge of all capital stock of each of Holdings subsidiaries. The lien securing the obligations under the revolving credit facility is a first priority lien as to certain liquid assets, including cash, accounts receivable, deposit accounts and inventory. The lien securing the obligations under the term loan facility is a first priority lien as to equipment, fixtures, intellectual property and equity interests. 
 We may be required to make mandatory prepayments under the revolving credit facility and the term loan in the event of a disposition of certain property or assets, in the event of receipt of certain insurance or condemnation proceeds, upon the issuance of certain debt or equity securities, upon the incurrence of certain indebtedness for borrowed money or upon the receipt of certain payments not received in the ordinary course of business. 
 Our revolving credit facility and term loan facility each require us to maintain a minimum availability at all times of not less than 10 of the gross borrowing base. In addition, the credit agreements governing each of our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit our ability to incur, create or assume certain indebtedness, to create, incur or assume certain liens, to make certain investments, to make sales, transfers and dispositions of certain property and to undergo certain fundamental changes, including certain mergers, liquidations and consolidations. The revolving credit facility and term loan facility also contain customary events of default, including defaults triggered by defaults under the other facility. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreements governing each of our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we are required to make assumptions, make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in Part II., Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In evaluating our business, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus interest expense (benefit), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, transition and severance costs related to director and officer transitions, and other gains, losses and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing expenses. Net loss is the most comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as, for any period, the Adjusted EBITDA for that period divided by the net sales for that period. We consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin important supplemental measures of our operating performance and believe they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Other companies in our industry, however, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as additional measurement tools for purposes of business decision-making, including evaluating store performance, developing budgets and managing expenditures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin allow investors to evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other condensed consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies, and, therefore, it may not be directly comparable to the results of other companies in our industry; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; and 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan carry floating interest rates tied to SOFR, the federal funds rate and the prime rate, and, therefore, our income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates to the extent that we do not have effective hedging arrangements in place. We historically have not used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the interest on our credit facilities. Based on a sensitivity analysis at November 2, 2024, assuming the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan would be outstanding for a full year, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by 1.7 million. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. However, this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 2, 2024. 
 Inherent Limitations in Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) during the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
