The
Company uses the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 260 to determine if-converted loss per share. ASC
260 states that convertible securities should be considered exercised on the latter of the first day of the reporting period s
quarter or the inception date of the debt instrument. Also, the if-converted method shall not be applied for the purposes of computing
diluted EPS if the effect would be anti-dilutive. 

of gross monthly sales payable
in 45 days; the distribution fee is netted against revenue. The Agreement provides for a rebate payable to the Distributor based on annual
sales volume that is retroactively applied. The rebate is estimated under the expected value method and is netted against revenue. Sales
are subject to various right of return provisions; the Company uses an expected value method to estimate returns and has determined that
any returns would be immaterial as of September 30, 2024. As a result, there is no return liability recorded. Shipping and handling costs
are a fulfillment activity and are reported as cost of sales. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized revenue from product sales under the Agreement of 
and , respectively. This represents and of total revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,
respectively. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized revenue from product sales under the Agreement of 
and , respectively. This represents and of total revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Rebate liability 

Distribution fee payable 

The
Company entered into a Distribution Services Agreement (the Covetrus Agreement with Covetrus North America LLC Covetrus on December 18, 2023. Contracts with Covetrus are evidenced by individual executed purchase orders subject
to the terms of the Covetrus Agreement. The contracts consist of a single performance obligation related to the sale of our pet care
products. Product sales occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms in the Covetrus Agreement. Revenue
is recognized upon delivery to the Distributor; payment is due within 60 days. The Covetrus Agreement provides for a rebate payable
to the Distributor based on annual sales volume that is retroactively applied. The rebate is estimated under the expected value
method and is netted against revenue. Sales are subject to various rights of return provisions; the Company uses an expected value
method to estimate returns and has determined that any returns would be immaterial as of September 30, 2024. As a result, there is no
return liability recorded. Shipping and handling costs are a fulfillment activity and are reported as cost of sales. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company did t
recognize revenue from product sales under the Covetrus Agreement. The Company did t
have any Accounts Receivable from Covetrus at September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized revenue from product sales under the Agreement of and
 , respectively. This represents and of total revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

The
guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows: 

Level
 1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 - inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar
 assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs
 that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3 - unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
 or liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and note payable and accrued
interest. The carrying amount of the Company s financial instruments approximates their fair value as of September 30, 2024, and
March 31, 2024, due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the Company s borrowing rate of interest. 

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The valuation
of the Company s note recorded at fair value is determined using Level 3 inputs, which consider (i) time value, (ii) current market,
and (iii) contractual prices. 

The
Company had assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024. 

Expected annual rate of quarterly dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual
term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends. The expected dividend yield is
based on the Company s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected
term of the share options and similar instruments. 

Risk-free rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected
term of the share options and similar instruments. 

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9, an entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable
by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee
achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the
same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with,
or using, the equity instruments. A recognized asset, expense, or sales discount shall not be reversed if a share option and similar
instrument that the counterparty has the right to exercise expires unexercised. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entity s
Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP.
Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded
conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative
scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income
per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
the standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments, which replaces the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected
loss model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, the Company is required to present certain financial assets carried
at amortized cost, such as insurance premium finance loans held for investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement
of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable
and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company adopted this standard in the consolidated
financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The change had no impact on the Company s financial statements. 

All
other newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

Legal
Proceedings 

David
Masters, a former employee, board member, and consultant to the Company, has threatened to file suit against the Company to recover in
excess of million. Masters threatened litigation relates to allegations that the Company promised him additional compensation,
shares, warrants, and future employment while he was associated with the Company. The Company mediated these claims with Masters in 2022
and executed a mediated settlement agreement resolving these claims for a one-time payment of , to be effective upon execution
of a long form agreement containing these and other settlement terms. The parties appointed the mediator as arbitrator to resolve any
disputes arising during the drafting of the long form agreement on commercially reasonable terms. In early 2023, Masters commenced arbitration
to have certain terms in the long form agreement decided. The arbitrator issued an award setting the final terms of the agreement. Soon
thereafter, Masters refused to execute the long form agreement set by the arbitrator; terminated the law firm representing him in the
mediation, negotiations, and arbitration; suggested that the arbitration award was tainted by a conflict of interest; and threatened
the claims set forth above. 

In
September 2023, Masters executed the long-term agreement and the Company recorded a settlement expense of . The settlement was
paid in October 2023.

stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 22, 2020, when it was approved by our stockholders and became effective.
On October 14, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved the PetVivo Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan
(the Amended Plan ), which increased the number of shares of the Company s common stock which may be granted under
the Amended Plan from to . Unless sooner terminated by the Board, the Amended Plan will terminate at midnight on July
10, 2030. The number of shares available to grant under the Plan was at September 30, 2024.

under the Amended Plan. In the case of consultants and advisors, however, their services cannot be in connection with the offer and sale
of securities in a capital-raising transaction nor directly or indirectly to promote or maintain a market for PetVivo common stock. 

The
Amended Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Committee ), which has full power
and authority to determine when and to whom awards will be granted, and the type, amount, form of payment, any deferral payment, and
other terms and conditions of each award. Subject to provisions of the Amended Plan, the Committee may amend or waive the terms and conditions,
or accelerate the exercisability, of an outstanding award. The Committee also has the authority to interpret and establish rules and
regulations for the administration of the Amended Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors may also exercise the powers of the Committee.

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Annually, we make predictive
assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, dividend yield, expected term, and forfeiture rate. The dividend yield assumption
is based on expected annual dividend yield on a grant date. To date, no dividends on common stock have been paid by us. Expected volatility
for grants is based on our average historical volatility over a similar period as the expected term assumption used for our options as
the expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected
term of the options for each option group. We use the simplified method to determine the expected term of the stock option
grants. We utilize this method because we do not have sufficient public company exercise data in which to make a reasonable estimate.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL 

PetVivo
Holdings, Inc. (the Company, PetVivo, we or us) is an emerging biomedical device company
focused on the manufacturing, commercialization, and licensing of innovative medical devices and therapeutics for animals. The Company
has a pipeline of products for the treatment of animals. A portfolio of nineteen patents protects the Company s biomaterials, products,
production processes, and methods of use. The Company began commercialization of its lead product Spryng with OsteoCushion 
Technology, a veterinarian-administered, intraarticular injection for the management of lameness and other joint afflictions such as
osteoarthritis in dogs and horses, in the second quarter of its fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. 

The
Company was incorporated in March 2009 under Nevada law under a different name. The Company operates as one segment from its corporate
headquarters in Edina, Minnesota. 

CURRENT
BUSINESS OPERATIONS 

The
Company is primarily engaged in the business of commercializing and licensing products in the veterinary market to treat and/or manage
afflictions of companion animals such as dogs and horses. Most of our technology was developed for human biomedical applications, and
we intend to leverage the investments already expended in their development to commercialize treatments for horses and companion animals
in a capital and time-efficient way. 

The
Company s initial product, Spryng , and its pipeline products are derived from proprietary biomaterials that simulate a body s
cellular tissue by virtue of their reliance upon natural protein and carbohydrate compositions which incorporate such tissue building
blocks as collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans such as heparin. Since these are naturally-occurring in the body, we believe they
have an enhanced biocompatibility with living tissues compared to synthetic biomaterials such as those based upon alpha-hydroxy polymers
(e.g PLA, PLGA, and the like), polyacrylamides, and other natural biomaterials that may lack the multiple proteins incorporated
into our biomaterials. These proprietary protein-based biomaterials are similar to the body s tissue thus allowing integration
and tissue repair in long-term implantation in certain applications. 

Our
initial product, Spryng , is a veterinary medical device designed to help reinforce and/or augment articular cartilage tissue for
the management of lameness and other joint related afflictions, such as osteoarthritis, in horses and companion animals. Spryng 
is an intra-articular injectable product of biocompatible and insoluble particles that are slippery, wet-permeable, durable, and resilient
to enhance the force cushioning function of the synovial fluid and cartilage. The particles mimic natural cartilage in composition, structure,
and hydration. Multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. Our particles are comprised of collagen, elastin, and heparin, similar
components found in natural cartilage. These particles show an effectiveness to reinforce and/or augment the cartilage, which enhances
the functionality of the joint (e.g. provide cushion or shock-absorbing features to the joint and to provide joint lubricity). 

26 

Osteoarthritis,
a common inflammatory joint disease in both dogs and horses, is a chronic, progressive, degenerative joint disease that is caused by
a loss of synovial fluid and/or the deterioration of joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis affects approximately 14 million dogs and 1 million
horses in the 11 billion companion animal veterinary care and product sales market. 

Despite
the market size, veterinary clinics and hospitals have very few treatments and/or drugs for use in treating osteoarthritis in dogs, horses,
and other pets. As there is no cure for osteoarthritis, current solutions treat symptoms, but do not manage the cause. The current treatment
for osteoarthritis in dogs generally consists of the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or NSAIDs which are
approved to alleviate pain and inflammation but present the potential for side effects relating to gastrointestinal, kidney, and liver
damage and do not halt or slow joint degeneration. The Company offers an alternative to traditional treatments that only address the
symptoms of the affliction. Spryng with OsteoCushion technology addresses the affliction, loss of synovial fluid, and/or
the deterioration of joint cartilage, rather than treating just the symptoms and, to the best of our knowledge, has elicited minimal
adverse side effects in dogs and horses. Spryng -treated dogs and horses have shown an increase in activity even after they no
longer are receiving pain medication or other treatments. Other treatments for osteoarthritis include steroid and/or hyaluronic acid
injections, which are used for treating pain, inflammation and/or joint lubrication, but can be slow acting and/or short lasting. 

We
believe Spryng is an optimal solution to safely improve joint function in animals for several reasons: 

Spryng 
 addresses the underlying problems which relate to deterioration of cartilage causing bones to contact each other and a lack of synovial
 fluid. Spryng provides a biocompatible lubricious cushion to the joint, which establishes a barrier between the bones, thereby
 protecting the remaining cartilage and bone. 

Spryng 
 is easily administered with the standard intra-articular injection technique. Multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. 

Case
 studies indicate many dogs and horses have long-lasting multi-month improvement in lameness after having been treated with Spryng . 

After
 receiving a Spryng injection, many canines are able to discontinue the use of NSAID s, eliminating the risk of negative
 side effects. 

Spryng 
 is an effective and economical solution for treating osteoarthritis. A single injection of Spryng is approximately 600 to
 900 per joint and typically lasts for at least 12 months. 

Historically,
drug sales represent up to 30 of revenues at a typical veterinary practice (Veterinary Practice News). Revenues and margins at veterinary
practices are being eroded because online, big-box, and traditional pharmacies have recently started filling veterinary prescriptions.
Veterinary practices are looking for ways to replace lost prescription revenues with safe and effective products. Spryng is a
veterinarian-administered medical device that should expand practice revenues and margins. We believe that the increased revenues and
margins provided by Spryng will accelerate its adoption rate and propel it forward as the standard of care for canine and equine
lameness related to or due to synovial joint issues. 

We
commenced sales of Spryng in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and plan to increase our commercialization efforts of Spryng 
in the United States through our distribution relationship with MWI Veterinary Supply Co. Distributor or MWI and the use of sales reps, clinical studies, and market awareness to educate and inform key opinion leaders on the benefits of Spryng TM . 

We
entered into a Distribution Services Agreement Distribution Agreement with MWI on June 17, 2022. Pursuant to the
Agreement, we appointed MWI to distribute, advertise, promote, market, supply, and sell the Company s lead product,
Spryng TM on an exclusive basis for two (2) years within the United States (the Territory ), transitioning to
a non-exclusive basis thereafter; provided however that the Company shall extend the exclusivity for an additional one (1) year if
MWI achieves certain performance targets agreed upon by the parties. The Company can continue to sell Spryng within the
Territory to established accounts, which include: (a) customers who have purchased Spryng TM from the Company prior to the
date of the Agreement, (b) customers who require that they deal directly with the Company, (c) governmental agencies, and (d)
customers that order via the internet who are not directly solicited by MWI to purchase Spryng . All customers must be
licensed veterinary practices. 

27 

Spryng 
is classified as a veterinary medical device under the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA rules and pre-market
approval is not required by the FDA. Spryng completed a safety and efficacy study in rabbits in 2007. Since that time, more than
2,000 horses and dogs have been treated with Spryng . We entered into a clinical trial services agreement with Colorado State University
on November 5, 2020. We expect this university clinical study to be completed in March 2024. Additionally, the Company successfully completed
an equine tolerance study in March 2022 and began two canine clinical studies with Ethos Veterinary Health, the first beginning in May
of 2022 with anticipated completion in October 2023, and the second beginning in June of 2023 with an expected completion in October
2024. We anticipate these and other studies that we plan to initiate will be primarily used to expand our distribution outlets since
the large international and national distributors generally require a third-party university study and other third-party studies prior
to including a product in their catalog of products. 

We
manufacture our products in an ISO 7 certified clean room manufacturing facility in Minneapolis using our patented and scalable self-assembly
production process, which minimizes the infrastructure requirements and manufacturing risks to deliver a consistent, high-quality product
while being responsive to volume requirements. A second ISO cleanroom facility is expected to be operational later this year. We believe
that having two manufacturing facilities will help us minimize supply risks, allow for continued scaling of our production capacity,
and expand our research and development facilities. 

We
also have a pipeline of therapeutic devices for both veterinary and human clinical applications. Some such devices may be regulated by
the FDA or other equivalent regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the Center for Veterinary Medicine CVM ).
We anticipate growing our product pipeline through the acquisition or in-licensing of additional proprietary products from human medical
device companies specifically for use in pets. In addition to commercializing our own products in strategic market sectors and in view
of the Company s vast proprietary product pipeline, the Company may establish strategic out-licensing partnerships to provide secondary
revenues. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our 2024 10-K Report and the consolidated financial statements and
related notes in Item 1, Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 10-Q Report ).
 The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ
materially from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are
not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2024 10-K Report under the heading Risk Factors, as updated and
supplemented by risks described in other SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements
for any reason, except as required by law. 

We
are a smaller reporting company and have incurred substantial losses in connection with our operations. We will need substantial capital
to pursue our current plans to commercialize our initial product, Spryng .

We

We expect to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities from time to time for the foreseeable future to

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the United States of America.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe
the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

The
Company has reviewed the FASB issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effective dates during the periods
reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting
principles and do not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial
position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to formal review of the Company s financial
management. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
- Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entity s
Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP.
Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded
conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative
scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income
per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
the standard on the consolidated financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments, which replaces the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected
loss model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, the Company is required to present certain financial assets carried
at amortized cost, such as accounts receivable, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses
is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts
that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company adopted this standard in the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended March 31, 2024. The change had no impact on the Company s financial statements. 

All
other newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures. 

We
maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based
upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures performed as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting. 

There
were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the second quarter ended September 30,
2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

of operations. 

Refer
to Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies, in the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in
Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report, for further information regarding legal contingencies. 

ITEM

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,
Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. The risks discussed in our Annual Report

 and 

(b) 
 Any
 fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
 internal control over financial reporting.
