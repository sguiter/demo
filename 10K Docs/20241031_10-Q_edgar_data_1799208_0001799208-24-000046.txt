The decrease in accounts receivable of million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to seasonal fluctuation, partially offset by the net reduction of the drawn amount related to our accounts receivable facility. 
 
 The decrease in deferred revenue of million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to million of revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2023, largely offset by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations. 
 
 The increase in contract assets of million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to new contract assets recognized, net of new amounts reclassified to receivables during 2024, partially offset by million of contract assets included in the balance at January 1, 2024 that were reclassified to receivable when they became unconditional.

The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily a result of a decrease to our uncertain tax positions as a result of an audit settlement, and a reduced state tax provision as the result of the change in reporting election, partially offset by the impact of Pillar Two introduced by OECD and adopted by certain non-U.S. countries, including countries in which we operate.

billion effective September 16, 2024 through March 27, 2028. For these swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of and will receive the one-month SOFR rate. 
 On August 2, 2024 and August 5, 2024, we entered into interest rate swaps, with a notional amount of million and million, respectively. Both swaps have a forward starting effective date of March 27, 2025 and a maturity date of March 27, 2028 ("forward starting interest rate swaps"). The Company will pay on the million swap and on the million swap, and will receive the one-month SOFR rate for both swaps. 
 Effective August 28, 2023, we amended our interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million that originally matured on March 27, 2024 ("2024 interest rate swaps"). The amendments extend the maturity date to March 27, 2025. Under the amended agreements, the Company pays a fixed rate of and receives the one-month SOFR rate. As a result of the amendment, the 2024 interest rate swaps were de-designated and the unrealized gain of million included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was frozen and had been systematically reclassified to earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the original term of the 2024 interest rate swaps. Additionally, the amended swaps had an aggregate fair value of million at inception and is recorded ratably to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings as an increase to interest expense over the term of the amended interest rate swaps. At the inception of the amended interest rate swaps, we performed a quantitative effectiveness assessment and determined that the swaps qualified for cash flow hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded in OCI, net of tax, and reclassified to earnings in the same line item associated with the hedged item when the hedged item impacts earnings. Additionally, we perform quantitative tests to assess hedging effectiveness over the remaining life of the amended swaps. 
 On February 2, 2023, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million, effective January 27, 2023 through February 8, 2026. For these swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of and received the one-month LIBOR rate through June 27, 2023 and receives the one-month Term SOFR rate after June 27, 2023 for the remainder of the term. On September 12, 2024, we terminated one of the interest rate swaps with a notional amount of billion and received million. The unrealized gain of million included within OCI has been reclassified to earnings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, we modified our Senior Secured Credit Facility to complete the transition of reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR. As a result, our interest rate swap agreements which previously received one-month LIBOR interest were also modified to receive one-month SOFR interest. We utilized the expedients set forth in ASC Topic 848, including those relating to derivative instruments used in hedging relationships. This transition did not result in a financial impact to our consolidated financial statements.

 In addition, we had forward starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million at September 30, 2024. See above for additional detail. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
 Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our international operations. From time to time, we follow a practice of hedging certain balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and net investments in our foreign subsidiaries. We may use short-term, foreign exchange forward and, from time to time, option contracts to execute our hedging strategies. Certain derivatives are designated as accounting hedges. 
 Foreign exchange forward contracts 
 To decrease earnings volatility, we currently hedge substantially all our intercompany balance positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short-term, foreign exchange forward contracts. The underlying transactions and the corresponding foreign exchange forward contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter and the fair value impacts are reflected within Non-operating income (expense) net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 These contracts are denominated primarily in the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Swedish Krona, and the Norwegian Krone. Our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under authoritative guidance and typically have maturities of 12 months or less. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of our foreign exchange contracts were million and million, respectively. 
 Cross-currency interest rate swaps 
 To protect the value of our investments in our foreign operations against adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we hedge a portion of our net investment in one or more of our foreign subsidiaries by using cross-currency interest rate swaps. Cross-currency swaps are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our foreign investments denominated in the non-U.S. dollar currency. The component of the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated foreign operations driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are partly offset by movements in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts. The change in the fair value of the swaps in each period is reported in OCI, net of tax. Such amounts will remain in accumulated OCI until the liquidation or substantial liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. Through the respective maturity dates of each of the swap contracts, we receive monthly fixed-rate interest payments, which are recorded as contra expense within "Interest expense" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). They are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our foreign investments denominated in the Euro currency. 
 On April 16, 2024, we executed tranches of cross-currency swaps with a total notional amount of million million). Two tranches have a notional amount of million each with a term, where we receive USD coupons at fixed rates of and , respectively, and pay EUR coupons of . The remaining tranche has a notional

As a result of the amendment, the cross-currency interest rate swap with the maturity date of July 19, 2024 was de-designated and the unrealized loss of million related to the off-market component included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be systematically reclassified to earnings as a reduction to interest expense through July 19, 2027.

We were in compliance with these non-financial covenants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 (2) The Revolving Facility contains a springing financial covenant requiring compliance with a maximum ratio of first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of .

The financial covenant did not apply at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 On February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement governing its Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities"). Subsequently, the credit agreement has been amended several times. Currently, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of a senior secured term loan facility and a senior secured revolving credit facility. 
 
 On January 29, 2024, we amended our credit agreement related to the then existing million term loan with a maturity date of January 18, 2029 (the "2029 Term Loan"), to reduce its interest rate by , resulting in a margin spread of SOFR plus per annum and to increase the then existing term loan facility by million to establish a new term loan with an aggregate principal amount of million and a maturity date of January 18, 2029 2029 Term Loan B ). The proceeds from the 2029 Term Loan B were used to fully repay the previously existing term loans, including the senior secured term loan with a maturity date of February 8, 2026 (the "2026 Term Loan") and the 2029 Term Loan. As a result, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of million related to the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the then existing 2026 and 2029 Term Loan. The loss was recorded within Non-operating income (expense)-net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Initial debt issuance costs of million related to the 2029 Term Loan B were recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of long term debt and are amortized over the contractual term of the term loan. Concurrently, we also amended our credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility to extend the maturity date to February 15, 2029, and to reduce the applicable margin by basis points, resulting in a margin spread of SOFR plus per annum, subject to a leverage-based pricing grid. The Credit Spread Adjustment under the Revolving Facility was also removed as part of the

million, which is deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement, together with the original unamortized deferred costs. 
 
 Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin over a SOFR or LIBOR for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to interest rate floors, and secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. We completed the transition of reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR in the second quarter of 2023. We utilized the expedients set forth in ASC Topic 848, including those relating to derivative instruments used in hedging relationships. This transition did not result in a financial impact to our consolidated financial statements.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance, such as those contained in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD A"). Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

 when considering extending business loans and trade credit. We are also a leading provider of data and analytics to businesses looking to analyze supplier relationships and more effectively collect outstanding receivables. We believe our proprietary Paydex score, a numerical indicator based on promptness of a business's payments to its suppliers and vendors, is widely relied upon as an important measure of credit health for businesses. We are well positioned to provide accessible and actionable insights and analytics that mitigate risk and uncertainty, and ultimately protect and drive increased profitability for our clients. 
 Our Sales Marketing solutions combine firmographic, personal contact, intent and non-traditional, or alternative data to assist clients in optimizing their sales and marketing strategy by cleansing customer relationship management ("CRM") data and narrowing their focus and efforts on the highest probability prospects. As global competition continues to intensify, businesses need assistance with focusing their sales pipelines into a condensed list so that they can have their best sellers target the highest probability return accounts. We provide invaluable insights into businesses that can help our clients grow their businesses in a more efficient and effective manner. 
 We leverage these differentiated capabilities to serve a broad set of clients across multiple industries and geographies. As of December 31, 2023, we had a global client base of approximately 240,000, including some of the largest companies in the world. Our data and analytics support a wide range of use cases covering nearly all industry verticals, including financial services, technology, communications, government, retail, transportation and manufacturing. In terms of our geographic footprint, we have an industry-leading presence in North America, an established presence in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("U.K."), Northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia and Latvia), Central Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and various other central and eastern European countries) (together as "Europe"), Greater China and India through our majority or wholly-owned subsidiaries and a broader global presence through our Worldwide Network alliances ("WWN alliances"). 
 
 We believe that we have an attractive business model that is underpinned by highly recurring, diversified revenue, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong free cash flow. The proprietary and embedded nature of our data and analytics solutions and the integral role that we play in our clients decision-making processes have historically translated into high client retention and revenue visibility. We also benefit from strong operating leverage given our centralized database and solutions, which allow us to generate strong contribution margins and free cash flow. 
 Segments 
 Our segment disclosure is intended to provide the users of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements with a view of the business that is consistent with management of the Company. 
 We manage our business and report our financial results through the following two segments: 
 North America offers Finance Risk and Sales Marketing data, analytics and business insights in the United States and Canada; and 
 International offers Finance Risk and Sales Marketing data, analytics and business insights directly in the UK, Europe, Greater China, India and indirectly through our WWN alliances. 
 Recent Developments 
 The following developments impact the year-over-year comparability of our results of operations, balance sheet and cash flows: 
 Debt Refinancing 
 On January 29, 2024, we amended our credit agreement related to the existing 451.9 million 2029 Term Loan, to reduce its interest rate by 0.25 resulting in a margin spread of SOFR plus 2.75 per annum and to increase the term loan facility by 2,651.7 million to establish a new term loan with an aggregate principal amount of 3,103.6 million 2029 Term Loan B and a maturity date of January 18, 2029. The proceeds from the 2029 Term Loan B were used to fully repay the existing term loans, including the 2026 Term Loan and the 2029 Term Loan. Concurrently, we also amended our credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility to extend the maturity date to February 15, 2029, and to reduce the applicable margin by 50 basis points, resulting in a margin spread of SOFR plus 2.50 per annum, subject to a leverage-based pricing grid. The Credit Spread Adjustment under the Revolving Facility was also removed as part of the amendment. 
 
 See Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 On April 30, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a three-year stock repurchase program, (the "2024 Stock Repurchase Program"), under which the Company may repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of its common stock. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated transactions through April 30, 2027. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 961,360 shares of common stock for 9.3 million, net of accrued excise tax, at an average price of 9.71 per share. There was no share repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impacts from Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and exposed to global market volatility and uncertainties from the evolving macroeconomic environment and ongoing effects of geopolitical conflicts, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and inflation trends, and potential economic slowdowns. Approximately 30 of our revenues are generated from non-U.S. markets. Fluctuation of U.S. dollar exchange rates against currencies of markets where we operate, in particular the Euro, British Pound and Swedish Krona, may adversely impact our revenue and profits. See further discussion within the revenue section of the MD A. 
 While the U.S. Federal Reserve bank has recently started to reduce interest rates as inflation eases in 2024, the pace of its future rate cuts could slow down, influenced by recent stronger employment data than previously expected. Uncertainty continues to remain in the outlook for U.S. economic growth and economic exposure relating to geopolitical conflicts, including the escalating conflicts in the Middle East and the Russian-Ukraine war, and ongoing global trade tensions. Uncertain economic conditions or an economic downturn could result in cautious commercial spending and lower discretionary spending, and consequently lower demand for our Sales Marketing Solutions. Disruptions in the financial markets could limit the ability or willingness of our clients to extend credit to their customers or cause our clients to constrain budgets, which could adversely impact demand for our data and analytics solutions. 
 
 While our financial performance has not been impacted materially by these events, the broader implications of these macro events on our business are difficult to predict and depend on, among many factors, their ultimate impact to our customers, vendors, and the financial markets. We will remain flexible so that we can adjust to events and uncertainties while we continue to move forward. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements

 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate our North America and International segment revenue primarily through subscription-based contractual arrangements that we enter into with clients to provide data, analytics and analytics-related services either individually, or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services. These arrangements occasionally include offerings from more than one business unit to the same client. 
 We provide Finance Risk solutions that offer clients access to our most complete and up-to-date global information, comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis. We also provide various business information reports that are consumed in a transactional manner across multiple platforms. Clients also use our services to manage supply chain risks and comply with anti-money laundering and global anti-bribery and corruption regulations. 
 
 We generate our Sales Marketing solutions revenue by providing sophisticated analytics and solutions to help our clients increase revenue from new and existing businesses, enabling B2B sales and marketing professionals to accelerate sales, enhance go-to-market activity, engage clients in a meaningful way, close business faster and improve efficiency in advertising campaigns. 
 
 Expenses 
 Cost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 
 
 We define cost of services as those expenses that are directly related to producing our products, services and solutions. These expenses primarily include data acquisition fees, costs related to our databases, service fulfillment costs, call center and 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 technology support costs, hardware and software maintenance costs, telecommunication expenses, personnel-related costs associated with these functions and occupancy costs associated with the facilities where these functions are performed. 
 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel-related costs for sales, administrative and corporate management employees, costs for professional and consulting services, advertising and occupancy and facilities expense of these functions. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation related to investments in property, plant and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and developed software and other intangible assets, principally database and client relationships recognized in connection with historical merger and acquisition transactions, notably the go-private transaction in 2019 as a result of a private equity buyout. 
 
 Non-Operating Income and (Expense) - Net 
 Non-operating income and (expense) - net includes interest expense, interest income, costs associated with early debt repayments, dividends from cost-method investments, mark-to-market expense related to certain derivatives, and other non-operating income and expenses. 
 Provision for Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 
 Provision for income tax expense (benefit) represents international, U.S. federal, state and local income taxes based on income in multiple jurisdictions for our corporate subsidiaries. Additionally, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision (benefit) for income taxes. 
 
 Key Metrics 
 In addition to reporting GAAP results, we evaluate performance and report our results on the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and rating agencies regarding our results, operating trends and performance between periods. These non-GAAP financial measures include organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"), adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net earnings per diluted share. Adjusted results are non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact due to certain acquisition and divestiture related revenue and expenses, such as costs for banker fees, legal fees, due diligence, retention payments and contingent consideration adjustments, restructuring charges, equity-based compensation, transition costs and other non-core gains and charges that are not in the normal course of our business such as costs associated with early debt redemptions, gains and losses on sales of businesses, impairment charges, the effect of significant changes in tax laws and material tax and legal settlements. We exclude amortization of recognized intangible assets resulting from the application of purchase accounting because it is non-cash and not indicative of our ongoing and underlying operating performance. Intangible assets are recognized as a result of historical merger and acquisition transactions. We believe that recognized intangible assets by their nature are fundamentally different from other depreciating assets that are replaced on a predictable operating cycle. Unlike other depreciating assets, such as developed and purchased software licenses or property and equipment, there is no replacement cost once these recognized intangible assets expire and the assets are not replaced. Additionally, our costs to operate, maintain and extend the life of acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property are reflected in our operating costs as personnel, data fees, facilities, overhead and similar items. Management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of recognized intangible assets will recur in future periods until such assets have been fully amortized. In addition, we isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another, both after and before the effects of foreign exchange rate changes. The change in revenue performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting both our prior and current periods foreign currency revenue by a constant rate. As a result, we monitor our revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange rate changes. We believe that these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures provide management and other users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance and comparability of our operating results from period to period. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Table of Contents 

 Our non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax. 
 Organic Revenue 
 
 We define organic revenue as reported revenue before the effect of foreign exchange excluding revenue from acquired businesses, if applicable, for the first twelve months. In addition, organic revenue excludes current and prior year revenue associated with divested businesses, if applicable. We believe the organic measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company s underlying revenue trends by excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Dun Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. excluding the following items: 
 depreciation and amortization; 
 interest expense and income; 
 income tax benefit or provision; 
 other non-operating expenses or income; 
 equity in net income of affiliates; 
 net income attributable to non-controlling interests; 
 equity-based compensation; 
 restructuring charges; 
 merger, acquisition and divestiture-related operating costs; 
 transition costs primarily consisting of non-recurring expenses associated with investments to transform our technology and back-office infrastructure, including investment in the architecture of our technology platforms and cloud-focused infrastructure. The transformation efforts require us to dedicate separate resources in order to develop the new cloud-based infrastructure in parallel with our current environment. These costs, as well as other expenses associated with transformational activities, are incremental and redundant costs that will not recur after we achieve our objectives and are not representative of our underlying operating performance. We believe that excluding these costs from our non-GAAP measures provides a better reflection of our ongoing cost structure; and 
 
 other adjustments include non-recurring charges such as legal expense associated with significant legal and regulatory matters and impairment charges. 
 We calculate adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 We define adjusted net income as net income (loss) attributable to Dun Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. adjusted for the following items: 
 incremental amortization resulting from the application of purchase accounting. We exclude amortization of recognized intangible assets resulting from the application of purchase accounting because it is non-cash and is not indicative of our ongoing and underlying operating performance. The Company believes that recognized intangible assets by their nature are fundamentally different from other depreciating assets that are replaced on a predictable operating cycle. Unlike other depreciating assets, such as developed and purchased software licenses or property and equipment, there is no replacement cost once these recognized intangible assets expire and the assets are not replaced. Additionally, the Company s costs to operate, maintain and extend the life of acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property are reflected in the Company s operating costs as personnel, data fees, facilities, overhead and similar items; 
 equity-based compensation;

 restructuring charges; 
 merger, acquisition and divestiture-related operating costs; 
 transition costs primarily consisting of non-recurring expenses associated with investments to transform our technology and back-office infrastructure, including investment in the architecture of our technology platforms and cloud-focused infrastructure. The transformation efforts require us to dedicate separate resources in order to develop the new cloud-based infrastructure in parallel with our current environment. These costs, as well as other expenses associated with transformational activities, are incremental and redundant costs that will not recur after we achieve our objectives and are not representative of our underlying operating performance. We believe that excluding these costs from our non-GAAP measures provides a better reflection of our ongoing cost structure; 
 merger, acquisition and divestiture-related non-operating costs; 
 debt refinancing and extinguishment costs; 
 non-operating pension-related income (expenses) includes certain costs and income associated with our pension and postretirement plans, consisting of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortized actuarial gains or losses, prior service credits and if applicable, plan settlement charges. These adjustments are non-cash and market-driven, primarily due to the changes in the value of pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and conditions; 
 
 non-cash gain and loss resulting from the modification of our interest rate swaps; 
 
 other adjustments include non-recurring charges such as legal expense associated with significant legal and regulatory matters and impairment charges; 
 tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments; and 
 other tax effect adjustments related to the tax impact of statutory tax rate changes on deferred taxes and other discrete items. 
 Adjusted Net Earnings Per Diluted Share 
 We calculate adjusted net earnings per diluted share by dividing adjusted net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the dilutive effect of common shares potentially issuable in connection with awards outstanding under our stock incentive plan.

 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (88.7) , reflecting a tax benefit of 1.8 million on pre-tax income of 2.1 million, compared to 171.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reflected a tax benefit of 11.2 million on a pre-tax loss of 6.5 million. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily a result of a reduction to the Global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") inclusion in the U.S. in the prior year quarter, and the impact of Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax ("Pillar Two") introduced by The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") and adopted by certain non-U.S. countries, including countries in which we operate, partially offset by a reduced state tax provision as the result of the change in reporting election. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 58.1 , reflecting a tax benefit of 48.9 million on pre-tax loss of 84.2 million, compared to 45.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflected a tax benefit of 40.5 million on a pre-tax loss of 88.9 million. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily a result of a decrease to our uncertain tax positions as a

 result of an audit settlement, and a reduced state tax provision as the result of the change in reporting election, partially offset by the impact of Pillar Two introduced by OECD and adopted by certain non-U.S. countries, including countries in which we operate. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net income (loss) attributable to Dun Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. was a net income of 3.2 million, or a diluted earnings per share of 0.01, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net income of 4.4 million, or a diluted earnings per share of 0.01, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a lower tax benefit of 9.4 million and higher net interest expense of 3.9 million driven by higher amortization loss related to the interest rate swap amendment completed in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher operating income of 10.1 million in the current year quarter (as discussed above in Operating Income (Loss)) and lower miscellaneous non-operating expenses of 2.2 million primarily driven by lower fees related to our Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 Net income (loss) attributable to Dun Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. was a net loss of 36.4 million, or a loss per share of 0.08, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 48.7 million, or a loss per share of 0.11, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement of 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to higher operating income of 39.4 million in the current year period (as discussed above in Operating Income (Loss)) and a larger tax benefit of 8.4 million, partially offset by higher net interest expense of 36.5 million primarily driven by higher debt extinguishment costs in the current year period in connection with the term loan amendment. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Earnings per Diluted Share 
 Adjusted net income was 116.0 million, or adjusted net earnings per diluted share of 0.27, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to adjusted net income of 116.2 million, or adjusted net earnings per diluted share of 0.27, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in adjusted net income was primarily attributable to higher tax expense and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher adjusted EBITDA (as discussed above in Adjusted EBITDA) and lower interest expense in the current year quarter. 
 
 Adjusted net income was 300.1 million, or adjusted net earnings per diluted share of 0.69, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to adjusted net income of 291.8 million, or adjusted net earnings per diluted share of 0.68, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted net income was primarily attributable to higher adjusted EBITDA (as discussed above in Adjusted EBITDA) and lower interest expense in the current year period, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher tax expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flows provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand and our short-term borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Our principal uses of liquidity are working capital, capital investments (including computer software), debt se rvice, business acquisitions and other gene ral corporate purposes. 
 We believe that cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as needed with available financing arrangements, is sufficient to meet our short-term needs for at least the next twelve months, including interest payments, contractual obligations, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, tax liabilities and restructuring charges. We continue to generate substantial cash from ongoing operating activities and manage our capital structure to meet short- and long-term objectives including investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. In addition, we have the ability to use the short-term borrowings from the Revolving Facility to supplement the seasonality in the timing of receipts in order to fund our working capital needs. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict, including the size, timing and structure of any future acquisitions, future capital investments and future results of operations. Our access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of our control, including fluctuation in interest rates, inflation, potential economic slowdowns or recession and the ongoing geopolitical conflicts. Currently, while we do not expect our ability to fund our operating needs to be affected by the current market volatility and uncertainties for the foreseeable future, the ultimate impact will be difficult to predict, and depends on, among many factors, the duration of inflation, the severity of the economic 
 48

 slowdown, the current global geopolitical risks, such as the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine conflicts, and their effects on global market conditions and on our clients and vendors, which continue to be uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted. We actively manage the impact of rising interest rates by reducing debt and entering into interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. 
 Cash Flow Overview 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 288.7 million, excluding restricted cash of 0.4 million, of which 285.1 million was held by our foreign operations. We utilize a variety of planning strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("2017 Act"), a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is no longer subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the United States. However, a portion of our cash held by our foreign operations is still subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax upon repatriation. As a result, we intend to reinvest indefinitely all earnings post 2017 from our China and India subsidiaries. Cash held in our China and India operations totaled 66.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (In millions): 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase (decrease) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 286.9 283.7 3.2 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (160.4) (120.3) (40.1) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (31.2) (139.3) 108.1 Total cash provided during the period before the effect of exchange rate changes 95.3 24.1 71.2 
 
 Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 Higher operating cash flows of 3.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by improvement in collection from accounts receivables, net of payments to our vendors and employees, partially offset by higher payments related to the accounts receivable securitization facility during the current year period. 
 We expect operating cash requirements in 2024 to be primarily related to payments for interest, contractual obligations, tax liability and other working capital needs. A portion of our outstanding debt is subject to the variability of interest rates. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average interest rate would result in an incremental increase or decrease in annual interest expense of approximately 32 million, respectively. We mitigate the exposure from the variation of interest rates by entering into interest rate swap arrangements, and as a result we reduce the net exposure to approximately 5 million. See Note 9 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In addition, we typically have various contractual obligations in our normal course of business, including those recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, and certain purchase commitments that are not recognized, but are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. A significant portion of these contractual obligations are related to payments for enterprise-wide information-technology services. We expect to continue to generate substantial cash from ongoing operating activities. 
 
 Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
 Higher net cash used in investing activities of 40.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher payments of 27.5 million for software development and a payment of 10.0 million to acquire a minority interest holding. 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 We expect capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of 195 million to 205 million. 
 Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 The decrease in net cash used in financing activities of 108.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher net debt issuance proceeds of 3,077.0 million in the current year period, payment of 95.7 million in the prior year period for the purchase of the non-controlling interest of our China operations, higher net proceeds of 4.7 million from borrowings on the Revolving Facility, partially offset by higher term loan repayments of 3,094.7 million, and payments of 9.3 million during the current year period related to our new stock repurchase program. 

Capital Resources and Debt 
 
 In addition to cash generated from our operating activities, we also borrow from time to time from our credit facility and issue long-term debt. 
 Below is a summary of our borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (In millions):

 Contractual Obligations 
 See Notes 6, 8, 11 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we filed on February 22, 2024, for expected payments for our debt, operating leases, pension obligations and vendor commitments, respectively.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements, other than our foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps discussed in Note 9 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our market risks primarily consist of the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities, the impact of changes in the market value of certain of our investments and the impact of changes in interest rates on our borrowing costs and fair value calculations. As of September 30, 2024, no material change had occurred in our market risks, compared with the disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Based upon their evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit with the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
