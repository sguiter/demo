Significant improvements to properties are capitalized, whereas, repairs and maintenance expenses at the Company's properties are expensed as incurred and included in real estate operating expense on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. When an asset is sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gain or loss reflected in the Company's results of operations for the period. Real estate assets will be evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. The Company will consider the following factors when performing its impairment analysis: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset; (2) significant negative industry and economic outlook or trends; (3) expected material costs necessary to extend the life or operate the real estate asset; and (4) its ability to hold and dispose of the real estate asset in the ordinary course of business. A real estate asset is considered impaired when the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the real estate asset over the estimated remaining holding period is less than the carrying value of such real estate asset. An impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the real estate asset over the fair value. When determining the fair value of a real estate asset, the Company makes certain assumptions including, but not limited to, consideration of projected operating cash flows, comparable selling prices and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the real estate asset based upon its estimate of a capitalization rate and discount rate. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had not recorded any impairments on its investments in real estate.

Recognition of premiums and discounts associated with these investments is deferred and recorded over the term of the investment as an adjustment to yield. Upfront costs and fees related to items for which the FVO is elected are recognized in earnings as incurred and are not deferred. Interest income, upfront costs and fees are recorded as components of income from investments in real estate debt on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation formed on September 8, 2021. We were formed to invest primarily in a portfolio of diversified income-oriented commercial real estate in the United States. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life corporation that intends to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We were formed to directly and indirectly acquire real estate and real estate-related assets and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate debt. Our investment objectives are to invest in assets that will enable us to: 
 provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive dividend yield; 

preserve and protect invested capital; 

realize appreciation in net asset value from proactive investment management and asset management; and 

provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate with lower volatility than public real estate companies. 

There can be no assurance that we will achieve our investment objectives. Our investments in primarily a portfolio of diversified institutional quality, income-oriented commercial real estate primarily in the United States will focus on a range of asset types. These may include office, hotel, industrial, multifamily and retail assets, as well as others, including, without limitation, healthcare, student housing, life sciences, hospitality, senior living, data centers, manufactured housing and storage properties. Our real estate debt or real estate-related debt securities investments will focus on non-distressed public and private real estate debt, including, but not limited to, commercial mortgage-backed securities, mortgages, loans, mezzanine and other forms of debt, and may also include preferred equity. 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. We plan to own all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership. 
 Our board of directors will, at all times, have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. However, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors. 
 We have registered with the SEC the Offering of up to 5.0 billion in shares of common stock, consisting of up to 4.0 billion in shares in our primary offering and up to 1.0 billion in shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and ongoing stockholder servicing fees, as well as varying management and performance participation fees. See "Note 11 - Related Party Transactions" to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. As of December 22, 2022, we had

The Operating Partnership has primarily used the net proceeds to make investments in real estate, real estate debt and real estate-related securities, as further described below under "Portfolio". We intend to continue selling shares of our common stock on a monthly basis through the Offering and private offerings.

Table of Contents 

Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue primarily consists of base rent arising from tenant leases at our properties. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, rental revenue was 6.3 million and 1.5 million, respectively. The increase in rental revenue was due to the acquisition of three additional properties subsequent to September 30, 2023. 
 Rental Property Operating Expenses 
 Rental property operating expenses consist of the costs of ownership and operation of our real estate investments. Examples of property operating expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repair and maintenance expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, rental property operating expenses were 1.5 million and 0.2 million, respectively. The increase in rental property operating expenses was due to the acquisition of three additional properties subsequent to September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal fees, accounting fees and fees for other professional services. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 1.4 million and 1.8 million, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven by non-recurring legal costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Management Fee 
 Management fees are earned by our Adviser for providing services pursuant to the Advisory Agreement and are based on the month end NAV for the respective share classes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fees were 2.1 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The increase in management fees was due to the increase in our average NAV from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 which was primarily driven by our capital raise activity and appreciation from our investments. 
 Performance Participation Allocation 
 The performance participation allocation relates to allocations from the Operating Partnership to the Special Limited Partner based on the total return of the Operating Partnership. Total return is defined as distributions paid or accrued plus the change in NAV. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the performance participation allocation was 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, as a result of the hurdle amount being achieved in the share classes subject to the performance participation allocation. In April 2024, approximately 5.2 million Class F-I shares, which are subject to the performance participation allocation, were exchanged for approximately 5.2 million Class A-I shares, which are not subject to the performance participation allocation, driving an overall decrease in the performance participation allocation as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by the values assigned to buildings and in-place lease assets as part of the initial purchase price allocation. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expenses were 2.8 million and 0.6 million, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was due to the acquisition of three additional properties subsequent to September 30, 2023. 
 Income from Investments in Real Estate Debt 
 Income from investments in real estate debt consists of interest income, fees revenue, realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses resulting from the changes in fair value of our investments in real estate debt. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income from investments in real estate debt was 17.4 million and 5.4 million, respectively. The increase in income from investments in real estate debt is due to originations, acquisitions and add-on fundings over the last twelve months resulting in higher interest income and origination fees. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 36 positions in commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and real estate-related securities, compared to 16 positions as of September 30, 2023, and the balance of our investments in real estate debt, at fair value increased from 220.6 million to 728.8 million during the same time period. 
 Other Income 
 Other income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents balance. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income was 1.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively. The decrease in other income was driven by a lower average cash balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs related to our mortgage note and secured debt arrangements. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 4.1 million. There was no interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as we did not have any debt obligations.

 30 

Table of Contents 

1.2 million respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of three additional properties subsequent to September 30, 2023. 
 Income from Investments in Real Estate Debt 
 Income from investments in real estate debt consist of interest income, fees revenue, realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses resulting from the changes in fair value of our investments in real estate debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income from investments in real estate debt was 41.9 million and 9.3 million, respectively. The increase in income from investments in real estate debt is due to originations, acquisitions and add-on fundings over the last twelve months resulting in higher interest income and origination fees. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 36 positions in commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and real estate-related securities, compared to 16 positions as of September 30, 2023, and the balance of our investments in real estate debt, at fair value increased from 220.6 million to 728.8 million during the same time period. 
 Other Income 
 Other income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents balance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income was 4.0 million and 4.6 million, respectively. The decrease in other was driven by a lower average cash balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs related to our mortgage note and secured debt arrangements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 6.7 million. There was no interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as we did not have any debt obligations. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering costs, operating fees and expenses and to make debt service payments on any outstanding indebtedness we may incur. We anticipate our offering and operating fees and expenses will include, among other things, the management fee we will pay to the Adviser, the performance participation allocation that the Operating Partnership will pay to the Special Limited Partner, stockholder servicing fees we will pay to the Dealer Manager, legal, audit and valuation expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to acquiring, financing, appraising and managing our properties. We do not have any office or personnel expenses as we do not have any employees. 
 The Adviser has advanced on our behalf organization and offering costs of 8.0 million and general and administrative expenses of 7.3 million as of September 30, 2024. We will reimburse the Adviser ratably over a 60-month period beginning on December 22, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 142.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 61.2 million of undrawn capacity on our secured debt arrangements. We may also generate incremental liquidity through the sale of our investments in real estate-related securities, which were classified as trading securities and carried at their estimated fair value of 30.7 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Over time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions from operations. We expect our cash needs for acquisitions will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock and through the assumption or incurrence of debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 344.0 million of proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock, including proceeds from our private offerings, and repurchased 4.8 million of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase plan. 
 Potential sources of liquidity include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets, equity issuances by the Operating Partnership or the sale of beneficial interests in specific Delaware statutory trusts holding real properties, including properties placed by the Operating Partnership or affiliates of Apollo. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 652.7 million of unencumbered assets at fair value, consisting of investments in real estate, as well as commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans. 
 Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations 
 We believe funds from operations FFO is a meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. Our condensed consolidated financial statements are presented under historical cost accounting which, among other things, requires depreciation of real estate investments to be calculated on a straight-line basis. As a result, our operating results imply that the value of our real estate investments has decreased evenly over time. However, we believe that the value of our real estate investments will fluctuate over time based on market conditions and, as such, depreciation under historical cost accounting may be less informative as a measure of our performance. FFO is an operating measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT that is broadly used in the REIT industry. FFO, as defined by NAREIT and presented below, is calculated as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) impairment of investments in real estate, (iii) net gains or losses from sales of real estate, and (iv) consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 We also believe that adjusted FFO AFFO is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP disclosure of our operating results. AFFO further adjusts FFO in order for our operating results to reflect the specific characteristics of our business by adjusting for items we believe are not 
 31 

Table of Contents 

related to our core operations. Our adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impact of (i) straight-line rental income and expense, (ii) unrealized gains or losses from changes in the fair value of real estate debt and other financial instruments, (iii) non-cash performance participation allocation, even if repurchased by us, (iv) amortization of restricted stock awards, (v) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, and (vi) similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO is not defined by NAREIT and our calculation of AFFO may not be comparable to disclosures made by other REITs. 
 FFO and AFFO should not be considered to be more relevant or accurate than the GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as indications of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as indications of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO and AFFO are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Consistent with our disclosure in the Prospectus regarding our NAV calculation, our investments in real estate and real estate debt are initially valued at cost. Once we establish new values for our real estate investments, we provide information on key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology and a sensitivity analysis related thereto. The valuations of our real properties as of September 30, 2024, excluding certain newly acquired properties that are held at cost which we believe reflects the fair value of such properties, were provided by the independent valuation advisor in accordance with our valuation procedures. Certain key assumptions that were used by the independent valuation advisor in the discounted cash flow analysis are set forth in the following table based on weighted-averages by property types where we have multiple real estate investments. Once we own more than one retail and one multifamily property, we will include the key assumptions for each such property type.

A change in these assumptions or factors would impact the calculation of the value of our property investments. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, the changes listed below would result in the following effects on our investment values:

The following details the adjustments to reconcile GAAP stockholders' equity to our NAV: 
 The Adviser has agreed that it and/or its affiliates will advance organization and offering expenses on our behalf (including legal, accounting, and other expenses attributable to our organization, but excluding upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and stockholder servicing fees) through December 22, 2023. In addition, the Adviser has agreed that it and/or its affiliates will advance certain general and administrative expenses on our behalf through December 22, 2023. We will reimburse the Adviser and 

33 

Table of Contents 

its affiliates for all such advanced expenses ratably over a 60-month period beginning on December 22, 2024. Under GAAP, organization costs are expensed as incurred and offering costs are charged to equity as such amounts are incurred. For NAV, such costs will be recognized as a reduction of NAV as they are reimbursed to the Adviser. 

Our investments in real estate and mortgage notes, net are presented under historical cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Since these assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair value to determine our NAV the appreciation is a reconciling item above. 

In accordance with GAAP, we depreciate our investments in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities. Such depreciation and amortization are not recorded for the purposes of calculating NAV. 

Accrued stockholder servicing fees represent the accrual for the cost of the stockholder servicing fee for Class S shares, Class D shares, Class F-S shares and Class F-D shares. Under GAAP, we accrued the full cost of the stockholder servicing fees payable over the life of each share (assuming such share remains outstanding the length of time required to pay the maximum stockholder servicing fee) as an offering cost at the time we sold the Class S shares, Class D shares, Class F-S shares and Class F-D shares. For purposes of calculating NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fees as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis when such fees are accrued. 

Distributions 
 Beginning in April 2023, we have declared monthly distributions for each class of our common stock and Operating Partnership units, which are generally paid 20 days after month-end. Each class of our common stock and Operating Partnership units received the same aggregate gross distribution per share, however, the net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable fees for such class. The table below details the net per share distribution for each of our share classes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents

(10,794) 

Cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately 32.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increased cash flows from income related to our investments in real estate and real estate debt. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased by approximately 185.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 184.0 million in investments in commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans and real estate-related securities and a net increase of 5.1 million in acquisitions of real estate. This was offset by an increase of 3.9 million of repayments from real estate-related securities. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities increased by approximately 210.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 188.6 million of proceeds from secured debt arrangements, net of financing costs, and a net increase of 42.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. This was offset by an increase of 14.9 million in cash distributions, an increase of 4.7 million in share repurchases and an increase in offering costs paid of 0.8 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion concerning recent accounting pronouncements. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt we may use to maintain liquidity, fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares of our common stock and expand our investment portfolio and operations. Market fluctuations in real estate financing may affect the availability and cost of funds needed to expand our investment portfolio. In addition, restrictions upon the availability of real estate financing or high interest rates for real estate loans could adversely affect our ability to dispose of real estate in the future. We will seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets. Also, we will be exposed to both credit risk and market risk. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 728.8 million of investments in real estate debt, including real estate debt securities. Our investments in real estate debt are primarily floating-rate and indexed to SOFR, thereby exposing us to interest rate risk resulting in increases or decreases to net income depending on interest rate movements. While we cannot predict factors that may or may not affect interest rates, a 50bps increase or decrease in the SOFR would have resulted in an increase or decrease to income from investments in real estate debt of 0.9 million and 2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our other target assets. We seek to mitigate this risk by seeking to acquire high quality assets, at appropriate prices given anticipated and unanticipated losses, and by deploying a value-driven approach to underwriting and diligence, consistent with the Adviser s historical investment strategy, with a focus on current cash flows and potential risks to cash flow. The Adviser seeks to enhance its due diligence and underwriting efforts by accessing the Adviser s knowledge base and industry contacts. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 
 Market Risk 
 35 

Table of Contents 

Our investments in real estate debt are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; pandemics; natural disasters and other acts of god. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans or loans, as the case may be, which could also cause us to suffer losses.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Co-Chief Executive Officer ("Co-CEO") and Interim Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-CEO and CFO. Based upon this evaluation, our Co-CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-CEO and Interim CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal action arising in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any material legal proceedings. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act. As described in Note 11 - Related Party Transactions to our condensed consolidated financial statements, the Adviser is entitled to an annual management fee payable monthly in cash, shares of common stock, or Operating Partnership units, in each case at the Adviser's election. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Adviser elected to receive its management fee in Class E shares and Class E units. In connection with the Adviser's election, we issued 81,893 Class E shares and 13,219 Class E units to the Adviser during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in satisfaction of the management fee from June 2024 to August 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold and issued 16,274 Class E shares to certain of Apollo's affiliates, employees and our directors pursuant to a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of 0.3 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued four Class E shares in lieu of cash for the dividends paid for a total value of approximately 80. These issuances were made in reliance upon the exemption from the registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, all unitholders of the Operating Partnership elected to reinvest their dividends. In connection with such dividend reinvestment, we issued 69,522 and 1,672 Class A-I units and Class E units, respectively, to the unitholders of the Operating Partnership in lieu of cash for the dividends paid during the three months ended September 30, 2024. These issuances were made in reliance upon the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 Use of Offering Proceeds 
 On June 29, 2022, the Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-264456) for the Offering was declared effective under the Securities Act. The offering price for each class of our common stock is determined monthly and is made available on our website and in prospectus supplement filings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 785.3 million from the Offering. The following table summarizes certain information about the Offering proceeds therefrom (in thousands):

We primarily used the net proceeds of the Offering along with the unregistered sales towards the acquisition of 279.2 million in real estate, 698.0 million in commercial real estate loans, and 30.4 million in net real estate-related securities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 6,078 Class F-I shares, 7,485 Class A-I shares and 62,290 Class A-II shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan for 1.6 million. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 We have adopted a share repurchase plan, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. We may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular month, in our discretion, subject to any limitations in the share repurchase plan. The aggregate NAV of total repurchases of Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares, Class F-S shares, Class F-D shares, Class F-I shares, Class A-I shares, Class A-II shares, Class A-III shares and Class E shares is limited to 2 of the aggregate NAV per month and 5 of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter. Shares are repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and have established limitations on the amount of funds we may use for repurchases during any calendar month and quarter. Further, our board of directors may modify or suspend the share repurchase plan. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased Class F-I shares, Class A-I shares and Class A-II shares in the following amounts:
