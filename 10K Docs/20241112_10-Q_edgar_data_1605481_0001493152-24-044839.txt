 NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED 

 CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR
THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED 

 SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 AND 2023 

 (UNAUDITED) 

on . On July 6,
2016, the Company changed its name from Tech Foundry Ventures, Inc. to Nevada Canyon Gold Corp. On December 15, 2021, the Company incorporated
two subsidiaries, Nevada Canyon LLC and Canyon Carbon LLC. Both subsidiaries were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada.
The Company is involved in acquiring and exploring mineral properties and royalty interests in Nevada and Idaho. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America US GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the business of acquiring and exploring mineral properties and royalty
interests and has not generated or realized any revenues from these business operations. The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s management has assessed the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
assessment is based on various factors, including historical and projected financial performance, liquidity, and other relevant circumstances.
As of the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, the Company has sufficient cash to meet its working
capital requirements and fund its exploration programs and general day-to-day operations for at least the next 12 months. This assessment
takes into account the Company s current cash balances as a result of the sale of the Company s common shares under offering
statement on Form 1-A (the Offering ), and expected future cash inflows from the Offering and future financing the management
is planning to undertake. 

While
the Company believes it has the financial resources to continue its operations for the next 12 months, it is important to note that there
are inherent uncertainties in projecting future cash flows, and there can be no assurance that these projections will be realized. The
Company continues to closely monitor its financial position, market conditions, and other factors that may impact its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s assessment is based on the information available as of the date of this report. If unforeseen
events, adverse market conditions, or other factors negatively affect the Company s financial position in the future, there may
be a need to adjust the going concern assessment. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. In the event that the Company s ability to continue as a going concern becomes doubtful, adjustments
to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as additional disclosures, would be necessary. 

at September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company s diluted EPS is calculated by dividing its net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings per share includes any additional dilution from common stock
equivalents, such as stock options, warrants, and convertible instruments, if the impact is not antidilutive. At September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, all of the Company s outstanding warrants and undistributed restricted stock awards are excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation because their impact would be anti-dilutive.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations 

Forward-looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
in Item 2 of Part I of this report include some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally
identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, 
 possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, 
 will, would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does
not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis
of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

Examples
of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding our ability
to generate operating cash flows and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Important assumptions relating
to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our future products, the timing and cost of
capital expenditures, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe
that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward-looking
statements include: 

management s
 plans, objectives and budgets for its future operations and future economic performance; 

capital
 budget and future capital requirements; 

meeting
 future capital needs; 

our
 dependence on management and the need to recruit additional personnel; 

limited
 trading for our common stock; 

the
 level of future expenditures; 

impact
 of recent accounting pronouncements; 

the
 outcome of regulatory and litigation matters; and 

the
 assumptions described in this report underlying such forward-looking statements. 

Actual
results and developments may materially differ from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements due to a number of factors, including: 

those
 described in the context of such forward-looking statements; 

future
 product development and marketing costs; 

the
 markets of our domestic operations; 

the
 impact of competitive products and pricing; 

the
 political, social and economic climate in which we conduct operations; and 

the
 risk factors described in other documents and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Registration
 Statement on Form S-1/A (SEC File No. 333-196075). 

We
operate in an extremely competitive environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict all of those
risks, nor can we assess the impact of all of those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor may cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable.
However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to
update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is provided as a supplement
to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

In
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Company, the Company, us, and our refer to
Nevada Canyon Gold Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Nevada Canyon LLC and Canyon Carbon LLC, incorporated in Nevada, unless the
context requires otherwise. 

We
intend the following discussion to assist in the understanding of our financial position and our results of operations for the three-
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. You should refer to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related
Notes in conjunction with this discussion. 

General 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on February 27, 2014. On December 15, 2021, we incorporated two subsidiaries,
Nevada Canyon LLC and Canyon Carbon LLC. Both subsidiaries were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada. 

We
are a US-based natural resource company headquartered in Reno, Nevada. The Company has a large, strategic land position and royalties,
in multiple projects, within some of Nevada s highest-grade historical mining districts. As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly
report on Form 10-Q our mineral property and royalty interests are comprised of the Lazy Claims Property, the Loman Property, and the
Agai-Pah Property located in Mineral County, Nevada, the Swales Property located in Elko County, Nevada, and the Belshazzar Property
located in Quartzburg mining district, Boise County, Idaho. In addition, we acquired a 1 production royalty on the Olinghouse Project,
located in the Olinghouse Mining District, Washoe County, Nevada, 2 net smelter returns royalty NSR on the Palmetto
Project located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, 2 NSR on the Lapon Canyon Project, 1 NSR on 36 Sleeper claims included in the Lapon Canyon
Project, and 2 NSR on the Pikes Peak Project which are located in Mineral County, Nevada. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP and are presented in US dollars. GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions,
judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense
amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information
regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to
GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with notes thereto,
which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent audited consolidated financial statements on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Revenues 

We
had no revenues for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the exploration rather than the production
nature of our business, we do not expect to have significant operating revenue in the foreseeable future. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included investor awareness and marketing
expenses, director and officer compensation, consulting fees, professional fees, transfer agent and filing fees, exploration expenses,
and general and administrative expenses. 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, our operating expenses increased by 259,595 or 39 , to 922,695 as compared to 663,100
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was associated with 304,958 we incurred in investor awareness and marketing
expenses, which during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased by 256,122, from 48,836 we incurred during the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023. Our consulting fees increased by 25,625, from 121,042 for the three-month period ended September 30,
2023, to 146,667 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. These increases were in part offset by a 13,303 decrease in general
and administrative expenses from 21,086 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 7,783 for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2024; and a 9,899 decrease in professional fees from 23,794 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 13,895
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Other
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included 423,468 in director and officer compensation for the vesting
of shares that we issued to our three directors on December 30, 2021 and with shares we granted to our VP of Operations on February 24,
2023 (2023 - 424,150), exploration expenses of 22,288 (2023 - 21,023), and transfer agent and filing fees of 3,636 (2023 
 3,169). 

18 

On
a year-to-date basis, our operating expenses increased by 1,145,211 or 66 , to 2,871,785 as compared to 1,726,574 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. This change was associated with 1,082,600 we incurred in investor awareness and marketing expenses, which
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased by 985,246, from 97,354 we incurred during the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. Our consulting fees increased by 94,778, from 300,535 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 395,313
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Our director and officer compensation increased by 117,346 from 1,147,656 we incurred
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 1,265,002 we incurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024;
the director and officer compensation was associated with the shares that we issued to our three directors on December 30, 2021, and
with shares we granted to our VP of Operations on February 24, 2023. Our transfer agent and filing fees increased by 7,151 from 11,759
we incurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 18,910 we incurred during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024; and our exploration expenses increased by 732 from 21,556 we incurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023,
to 22,288 we incurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

These
increases were in part offset by a 58,504 decrease in professional fees from 100,114 for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, to 41,610 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1,042 gain on fair value of investments in equity securities (2023
 20,206 loss). The gain resulted from revaluation of WRR Shares and, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was caused only as a result of fluctuation of exchange
rates between the US and Canadian dollars, as the price of the WRR shares remained unchanged from period to period. In addition, we
earned 92,735 in interest income, which increased in comparison to 8,082 we earned during the three months ended September 30,
2023, as a result of larger cash balances from capital raise. 

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 19,716 gain on fair value of investments in equity securities (2023 
 115,168 loss). The gain resulted from revaluation of WRR Shares and was caused mainly by increased market price of WRR Shares
from CAD 0.145 per share at December 31, 2023, to CAD 0.20 per share at September 30, 2024, and to a smaller degree from fluctuation
of exchange rates between the US and Canadian dollars. In addition, we earned 318,384 in interest income, which increased in comparison
to 21,895 we earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of larger cash balances from capital raise. 

Net
Loss 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net loss of 828,915, as compared to net loss of 675,228 we incurred during the
three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This change mainly resulted from increased investor awareness and marketing expenses which
were in part offset by increased interest income and decreased professional fees. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net loss of 2,533,689, as compared to net loss of 1,819,847 we incurred during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This change mainly resulted from increased investor awareness and marketing expenses
which were in part offset by increased interest income and decreased professional fees.

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 7,399,434 and working capital of 6,640,168 with cash flows used in operations totaling
 824,134 for the nine-month period then ended. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operations were funded with cash
on hand. The cash that we had on hand at September 30, 2024, was generated from the issuance of 12,499,343 Units under the offering statement
on Form 1-A (the Offering for net cash proceeds of 9,598,012, which we closed during the year ended December 31, 2023,
and from exercise of Warrants we issued as part of the Offering. 

Due
to the exploration rather than the production nature of our business, our operating activities do not generate cash flows, and cannot
satisfy our cash requirements. However, we believe that the cash we were able to generate from the Offering will allow us to support
our operations including our planned exploration programs and the general day-to-day business activities for the next 12-month period.
We will continue to look for opportunities to generate additional cash through future equity or debt financings.

accrued liabilities. These uses of cash were in part offset by a 22,966 decrease in prepaid expenses.

Going
Concern 

At
September 30, 2024, we had a working capital surplus of 6,640,168 and cash on hand of 7,399,434, which is sufficient to support our
current plan of operations including exploration programs for the next 12-month period. Our investment in equity security is represented
by 511,750 WRR Shares valued at 75,821. 

To
support our operations beyond the 12-month period, we are planning to continue actively pursuing other means of financing our operations
including equity and/or debt financing. On October 3, 2024, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor Investor which provides that the Company may sell to Investor up to 25,000,000 of our
common stock for the duration of the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration
Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC covering the resale of shares of Common Stock that would be issued to Investor under the Purchase Agreement.
The Company filed a preliminary registration statement on Form S-1, on October 25, 2024. 

Given
the current market and industry conditions, we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue successfully procuring additional funding.
If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control) delay our realization of revenues or cash flows from
operations, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan. Moreover, if our resources from obtaining additional capital
or cash flows from operations, once we commence them, do not satisfy our operational needs or if unexpected expenses arise due to unanticipated
pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan beyond its currently anticipated level or otherwise, we will require additional
financing to fund our operations, in addition to anticipated cash generated from our operations. Additional financing might not be available
on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund
our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures
would be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund our operations or to remain in business, which
could result in a total loss of our stockholders investment. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible
debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities might have rights,
preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.

of Inflation

believe that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past fiscal quarter.
