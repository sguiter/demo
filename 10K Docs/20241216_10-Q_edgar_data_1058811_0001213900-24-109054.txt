million. At the end of each reporting period, equity related to Barnes Noble Education that is attributable to Immersion and the other owners is rebalanced to reflect Immersion s and the other owners ownership in Barnes Noble Education. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the applicable articles of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, in conformity with U.S. GAAP and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of only normal and recurring items necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented have been included. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 
 Due to their nonhomogeneous operations, our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the month ended July 31, 2024 and the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, separately present the operating assets, liabilities, and operations of Immersion s business from the operating assets, liabilities and operations of Barnes Noble Education's business. All of the assets of Barnes Noble Education, reported on the balance sheet, can be used only to settle obligations of Barnes Noble Education. None of the liabilities of Barnes Noble Education have recourse to the general credit of Immersion Corporation. 

reportable segments, Immersion and Barnes Noble Education. 

Significant Accounting Policies Related to Barnes Noble Education 
 
 A summary of the new significant accounting policies as a result of our acquisition of Barnes Noble Education is as follows: 

million, comprised of million in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the C ondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to segregated funds for commission due to Lids for logo merchandise sales as per the Lids service provider merchandising agreement and million in Other assets-noncurrent in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to amounts held in trust for future distributions related to employee benefit plans. The restricted cash was part of net assets acquired as part of the Transactions (defined below). 

million in the merchandise inventory, measured at fair value, as part of the Transactions (defined below). 

million in rental textbook inventory, measured at fair value, as part of the Transactions (defined below). 

Revenue from the sale of digital textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is recognized when the customer accesses the digital content as product sale in Barnes Noble Education's condensed consolidated financial statements. A software feature is embedded within the content of Barnes Noble Education's digital textbooks, such that upon expiration of the term the customer is no longer able to access the content. While the sale of the digital textbooks allow the customer to access digital content for a fixed period of time, once the digital content is delivered to customers, the performance obligation is complete. 
 Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer and is recognized as rental income in Barnes Noble Education's condensed consolidated financial statements. Rental periods are typically for a single semester and are always less than in duration. Barnes Noble Education offers a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented physical textbook at the end of the rental period if the customer desires to do so. It records the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and pays the buyout option price which is determined at the time of the buyout. In these instances, Barnes Noble Education accelerates any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale. 
 Revenue recognized for the BNC First Day offerings is consistent with Barnes Noble Education's policies outlined above for product, digital and rental sales, net of an anticipated opt-out or return provision. Given the growth of BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from Barnes Noble Education's school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day affordable textbook access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in Barnes Noble Education's third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and its quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. 
 Barnes Noble Education estimates returns based on an analysis of historical experience. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded. 
 For sales and rentals involving third-party products, Barnes Noble Education evaluates whether it is acting as a principal or an agent. This determination is based on Barnes Noble Education's evaluation of whether it controls the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether Barnes Noble Education controls the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer, including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. For those transactions where Barnes Noble Education is the principal, it records revenue on a gross basis, and for those transactions where Barnes Noble Education is an agent to a third-party, it records revenue on a net basis. 
 As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by Lids and Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC Fanatics , collectively, F/L Relationship), Barnes Noble Education recognizes commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Barnes Noble Education does not have gift cards or customer loyalty programs. Barnes Noble Education does not treat any promotional offers as expenses. Sales tax collected from Barnes Noble Education's customers is excluded from reported revenues. Barnes Noble Education's 

Service and other revenue 
 Service and other revenue is primarily derived from brand marketing services which include promotional activities and advertisements within Barnes Noble Education's physical bookstores and web properties performed on behalf of third-party customers, shipping and handling, and revenue from other programs. 
 Brand marketing agreements often include multiple performance obligations which are individually negotiated with Barnes Noble Education's customers. For these arrangements that contain distinct performance obligations, Barnes Noble Education allocates the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price SSP of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. The revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, typically at a point in time for brand marketing service and over time for advertising efforts as measured based upon the passage of time for contracts that are based on a stated period of time or the number of impressions delivered for contracts with a fixed number of impressions. 

. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Barnes Noble Education conducted a rights offering (the Rights Offering ), whereby Barnes Noble Education distributed at no charge to the holders of its common stock BNED Common Stock non-transferable subscription rights Rights to purchase up to an aggregate of new shares of BNED Common Stock (the Offered Shares at a subscription price of per share (the Subscription Price ). On the Closing Date, Barnes Noble Education issued the Offered Shares, which generated million in gross proceeds, including approximately million of Offered Shares purchased by Toro 18 Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Immersion, Investor pursuant to the Backstop Commitment (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment, Immersion through Investor, purchased shares of BNED Common Stock. Barnes Noble Education reimbursed Immersion, through Investor, for reasonable legal and other expenses in connection with the Transactions in the amount of million. Barnes Noble Education also paid an amount equal to million to Immersion, through Investor, as payment in consideration for its Backstop Commitment. 
 
 In addition to the Rights Offering, Immersion, through Investor, purchased from Barnes Noble Education an aggregate of new shares of BNED Common Stock at the Subscription Price for a purchase price of million (the PIPE Transaction , and together with the Rights Offering, the Transactions ). 
 
 As a result of the Transactions, Barnes Noble Education received a total of million in gross proceeds, of which million was used to reduce its outstanding debt. 
 
 In connection with the closing, Barnes Noble Education appointed Eric Singer, William C. Martin, Emily S. Hoffman, and Elias Nader to serve as members of the board of directors of BNED (the BNED Board following the Closing. Messrs. Singer, Martin and Nader and Ms. Hoffman are current members of our Board. In addition, at the closing, Sean Madnani was appointed to the Barnes Noble Education Board along with existing directors, Kathryn Eberle Walker and Denise Warren who will each continue to serve on the BNED Board following the Closing. 
 
 As part of the Transactions, we acquired of all outstanding common shares of Barnes Noble Education, as well as control over Barnes Noble Education through the Immersion-appointed board seats. The total consideration transferred was approximately million, consisting of million in cash consideration paid to Barnes Noble Education less million in transaction costs incurred by Immersion but reimbursed by Barnes Noble Education. For the six months ended October 31, 2024 , Immersion incurred costs related to this acquisition of million, inclusive of the expenses reimbursed by Barnes Noble Education, that were expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The acquisition aims to expand Immersion's offerings, increase its customer reach, and diversify into the education sector. 
 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the total purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values on the acquisition date with the excess recorded as goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of the net assets acquired as of the Closing Date while the measurement period remains open, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition will be applied retrospectively to the Closing Date. 
 
 The fair value of the noncontrolling interest of million on the Closing Date was calculated using the acquisition-date fair value of per share multiplied by the number of noncontrolling interest shares.

Customer relationships consist of distinct values associated with Barnes Noble Education s large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty across a diverse customer base. 

We used the assistance of a third-party firm to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. We used an income approach to estimate the fair values of the trade names and customer relationships . The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods. The major assumptions used to estimate the values of identifiable intangible assets include management s estimates of future revenue, adjusted for growth and attrition based on historical data and management's forward-looking expectations. These cash flows were discounted at a rate of , which reflects our cost of equity. The useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flow. 
 Goodwill generated from this acquisition is primarily attributed to the value of Barnes Noble Education s assembled workforce. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our entire goodwill balance is associated with the Barnes Noble Education reporting unit. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 

We acquired a deferred tax asset of million, recorded and a deferred tax liability of million, recorded under Deferred tax liabilities, net noncurrent, as part of this business combination, as shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
 We also used the assistance of a third-party valuation firm to estimate the fair value of the property and equipment, and inventory acquired. The fair value as of the Closing Date reflects a step-up in basis due to the highly depreciable nature of the property and equipment. No material fair value adjustments for inventory were identified, as there are minimal costs associated with procurement. 
 
 Most of the net tangible assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fair values. The leases acquired were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. 
 The acquired entity s results of operations were included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, June 10, 2024, as adjusted for specific fair value adjustments discussed above. For the month ended July 31, 2024, the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 , Barnes Noble Education contributed net operating revenue of million, million and million, respectively, which is reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations . 
 
 The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the acquisition of Barnes Noble Education as if it was consummated on January 1, 2023 (the beginning of the comparable prior reporting period), and includes pro forma adjustments related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and direct and incremental transaction costs reflected in the historical financial statements. Specifically, the following nonrecurring adjustments were made: 

For the six months ended October 31, 2024 , our direct and incremental acquisition-related expenses of million and one -time severance payment of million are excluded from the pro forma condensed combined net income.

Effective tax rate 
 
 () 

Provision for income taxes for the month ended July 31, 2024, and the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 resulted primarily from estimated domestic and foreign taxes included in the calculation of the effective tax rate. 
 We provided no valuation allowance for federal deferred tax assets, whose future realization is more likely than not and continue to maintain full valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets in the United States as well as federal tax assets in Canada. Changes in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from the change in income from continuing operations across various tax jurisdictions. 
 In the event that we determine the deferred tax assets are realizable based on an assessment of relevant factors, an adjustment to the valuation allowance may increase income in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance does not impact our ability to utilize the underlying net operating loss carryforwards. We also maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740 Income Taxes of approximately million, all of the million could be payable in cash. In addition, interest and penalty of million could also be payable in cash in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is million. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax provision. We do not expect to have any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. 
 
 Barnes Noble Education 
 Barnes Noble Education recorded an income tax provision of million on pre-tax loss of million during the period of May 1, 2024, to October 31, 2024, which represented an effective income tax rate of ) . 
 In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized. As of October 31, 2024, Barnes Noble Education determined that it was more likely than not that it would not realize all deferred tax assets and its tax rate for the current fiscal year reflects this determination. Barnes Noble Education will continue to evaluate this position. 
 
 Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change (generally defined as a cumulative change in our ownership by 5 -percent shareholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three -year period), the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating losses and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. As a result of the rights offering, backstop commitment, private investment, and debt term loan conversion completed on June 10, 2024, Barnes Noble Education may have experienced an ownership change as defined by Sections 382 and 383 . Barnes Noble Education intends to perform a study to determine if an ownership change has occurred. If it is determined that an ownership change has occurred under Section 382 and 383 , Barnes Noble Education expects any corresponding annual limitations to severely impact the future utilization of its tax attributes including its million NOL carryforward.

The appellate case is in progress at the Seoul High Court and the first and the second hearings took place on November 30, 2023, and February 1, 2024, respectively. However, the next hearing will be set at a later date. 
 
 On April 25, 2023, we received notice from LGE requesting us to reimburse LGE with respect to withholding tax imposed on LGE by the Korean tax authorities following a recent tax audit of LGE for the years 2018 through 2022 . Pursuant to an agreement reached with LGE, on June 2, 2023, we provided a provisional deposit to LGE in the amount of KRW (approximately million) representing the amount of such withholding tax that was imposed on LGE, which provisional deposit would be returned to us to the extent we ultimately prevail in the appeal in the Korean courts. In the second quarter of 2023 , we recorded this deposit in Long-term deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets . On June 29, 2023, on behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Tax Tribunal regarding their findings with respect to the withholding taxes related to the 2018 to 2022 period. On August 7, 2023, the Korean tax authority submitted its answer against the tax appeal. On September 8, 2023, on behalf of LGE, the Company submitted its rebuttal brief in response thereto. On September 25, 2023, the Korean tax authority submitted an additional response brief, and on November 23, 2023, the Korea Tax Tribunal rendered a decision against LGE, dismissing the claims of the Company on the grounds that its claims are without merit. In response thereto, on behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Administrative Court on December 29, 2023. On July 23, 2024, the Korea Tax Tribunal rendered a decision against LGE, and the deadline for the court appeal of the local income claim is October 21, 2024. In addition, the Korea Administrative Court scheduled a hearing date of August 29, 2024, which was cancelled and will be rescheduled at a later date. On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a complaint and a brief with the Korea Administrative Court for the local income tax appeal. This case has been reassigned due to its significance and the Korean tax authority filed its answer on November 27, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, we have accrued million of withholding taxes, interest and penalties related to the 2018 to 2022 period for which the Korean tax authorities have recently assessed LGE. These withholding taxes have been reclassified and reported as an impairment reduction to the Long-term deposit made in the third quarter of 2023 in order to present the deposit at its estimated recoverable value. 

Based on th e developments in these cases, we regularly reassess the likelihood that we will prevail in the claims from the Korean tax authorities with respect to the LGE case. To the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that we will prevail against the claims from the Korean tax authorities, then no additional tax expense is provided for in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (loss) . In the event that we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not prevail against the claims from the Korean tax authorities, or a portion thereof, then we would estimate the anticipated additional tax expense associated with that outcome and record it as additional income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the period of the new determination. If the additional income tax expense was related to the periods assessed by Korean tax authorities and for which we recorded a Long-term deposit on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , then the additional income tax expense would be recorded as an impairment to the Long-term deposits . If the additional income tax expense was not related to the periods assessed by Korean tax authorities and for which we recorded in Long-term deposits on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets , then the additional income tax expense would be accrued as an Other current liabilities . 
 In the event that we do not ultimately prevail in our appeal in the Korean courts with respect to this case, the applicable deposits included in Long-term deposits would be recorded as additional income tax expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operation and Comprehensive Income (loss) , in the period in which we do not ultimately prevail.

 COMPANY OVERVIEW 
 Immersion Corporation Immersion was incorporated in 1993 in California and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999 . In this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the terms the Company, us, we, or our refer to Immersion and its consolidated subsidiaries. Immersion generates license and royalty revenues from a wide range of IP that more fully engage users sense of touch when operating digital devices. We focus on the following target application areas: mobile devices, wearables, consumer, mobile entertainment and other content; console gaming; automotive; medical; and commercial.

On June 10, 2024, we acquired a controlling interest in Barnes Noble Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation Barnes Noble Education or BNED ), refer to Note 2 . Business Combination for more information. The financial results of Barnes Noble Education have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date of June 10, 2024. 
 Following the closing of the Transactions (as defined in Note 2 . Business Combination) with Barnes Noble Education we operate our business in two operating segments: Immersion and Barnes Noble Education. 
 In order to more closely align with Barnes Noble Education s fiscal year end, on September 27, 2024, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a change of our fiscal year from the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 to the period beginning on May 1 and ending on April 30. As a result of the change in fiscal year end, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-QT for the transition period from January 1, 2024, through April 30, 2024, on November 8, 2024. The change in quarterly reporting from the old to the new fiscal year resulted in the one month period ended July 31, 2024 not being covered by a separate report on Form 10-Q. As this period is not covered in the transition report, it is included in this first initial report on Form 10-Q for the newly adopted fiscal year. The financial results for the month ended July 31, 2024, did not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operation. 
 Our fiscal year begins on May 1 and ends on April 30. Our new fiscal quarters end on July 31, October 31, January 31 and April 30. Therefore, the financial results of certain fiscal quarters may not be comparable to the financial results of prior fiscal quarters. References throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to fiscal 2025 with respect to Immersion refer to the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025. 
 The financial information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes the financial information of Barnes Noble Education for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended October 26, 2024. 
 
 We did not recast the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended October 31, 2023, because the financial reporting processes in place at that time included certain procedures that were completed only on a quarterly basis. Consequently, to recast this period would have been impractical and would not have been cost-justified. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, are presented as the most nearly comparable quarter of the earlier year.

Immersion 
 Immersion generates license and royalty revenues from a wide range of IP that more fully engage users sense of touch when operating digital devices. We focus on the following target application areas: mobile devices, wearables, consumer, mobile entertainment and other content; console gaming; automotive; medical; and commercial. 
 We have adopted a business model under which we offer licenses to our patented technology to our customers and offer our customers enabling software, related tools and technical assistance related to integrate our patented technology into our customers products or enhance the functionality of our patented technology. Our licenses enable our customers to deploy haptically-enabled devices, content and other offerings, which they typically sell under their own brand names. We and our wholly-owned subsidiaries hold more than 800 issu ed or pending patents worldwide as of October 31, 2024 . Our patents cover a wide range of digital technologies and ways in which touch-related technology can be incorporated into and between hardware products and components, systems software, application software, and digital content. We believe that our IP is relevant to many of the most important and cutting-edge ways in which haptic technology is and can be deployed, including in connection with mobile interfaces and user interactions, in association with pressure and other sensing technologies, as part of video and interactive content offerings, as related to virtual and augmented reality experiences, and in connection with advanced actuation technologies and techniques. Our portfolio includes numerous patents and patent applications that we believe may become essential to emerging standards in development by Standards Development Organizations SDOs including media standards in development by ISO/IEC Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG) and software and system standards in development at IEEE-SA.

Revenues 
 Immersion revenue is primarily derived from fixed fee license agreements and per-unit royalty agreements. Royalty and license revenue is composed of per unit royalties earned based on usage or net sales by licensees and fixed payment license fees charged for our IP and software. 
 Fixed fee license revenue increased by 9.4 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 , primarily due to 9.7 million increase in mobility license revenue following the new license agreements we entered into in the first half of fiscal 2025 . 
 Per-unit royalty revenue decreased by 2.3 million, or 40 , in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 , primarily due to a 2.4 million decrease in royalties from mobility licensees. 
 Geographically, revenues generated in Asia, North America and Europe for the three months ended October 31, 2024 represented 90 , 5 , and 5 , respectively, of our total revenue as compared to 14 , 83 , and 3 , respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 .

Fixed fee license revenue increased by 53.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 , primarily due to a 53.8 million increase in mobility license revenue following the new license agreements we entered into in the first half of fiscal 2025 . 
 
 Per-unit royalty revenue decreased by 5.1 million, or 44 , in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 , primarily due to a 2.9 million decrease in royalties from mobility licensees, a 1.4 million decrease in royalties from gaming licensees and a 0.9 million decrease in royalties from other licensees. 
 
 Geographically, revenues generated in Asia, North America and Europe for the six months ended October 31, 2024 represented 96 , 3 , and 1 , respectively, of our total revenue as compared to 9 6 , 1 , and 3 , respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 .

Selling and administrative expenses - Our selling and administrative expenses primarily consisted of employee compensation and benefits including stock-based compensation; legal and other professional fees; external legal costs for patents; office expense; travel; and facilities costs. 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.3 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a 0.8 million increase in compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs partially offset by a 0.5 million decrease in legal costs. The increase in compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs is largely attributable to higher stock-based compensation expense resulting from new equity grants partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation. 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased 9.9 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to a 5.1 million increase in legal costs and a 4.9 million increase in compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs. The increase in legal costs was due to an increase from legal costs related to the new license agreements and Barnes Noble Education Transactions. The increase in compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs were largely driven by increases in variable compensation and higher stock-based compensation.

 BNC First Day Affordable Textbook Programs 
 Barnes Noble Education provides product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. Barnes Noble Education offers its BNC First Day affordable textbook access programs, consisting of First Day Complete and First Day, which provide faculty required course materials to students on or before the first day of class at below market rates, as compared to the total retail price for the same course materials if purchased separately (a la carte), and students are billed the below market rate directly by the institution as a course charge or included in tuition. 
 First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes all or the majority of undergraduate classes (and on occasion graduate classes), providing students with both physical and digital materials. In addition to providing numerous benefits to students, faculty and administrators, the First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sales and sell-through for the bookstore. 
 First Day is adopted by a faculty member for a single course, and students receive primarily digital course materials through their school's learning management system ("LMS").

Offering course materials through the BNC First Day affordable textbook access programs, First Day Complete and First Day, is an important strategic initiative to meet the market demands of reduced pricing for students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing Barnes Noble Education's market share, revenue and relative gross profits of course material sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. These affordable textbook access programs have allowed Barnes Noble Education to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines, which has been observed at those schools where such programs have been adopted. Barnes Noble Education is moving quickly to accelerate its First Day Complete strategy. Many institutions have already adopted First Day Complete, and Barnes Noble Education plans to continue to scale the number of schools adopting First Day Complete in fiscal 2025 and beyond. 
 Seasonality 
 Barnes Noble Education's business is highly seasonal, particularly with respect to textbook sales and rentals, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Barnes Noble Education's quarterly results also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods. 
 Given the growth of BNC First Day affordable textbook access programs, the timing of cash collection from the school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts Barnes Noble Education's BNC First Day affordable textbook access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in the third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and Barnes Noble Education's quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. As a higher percentage of Barnes Noble Education's sales shift to BNC First Day affordable textbook access offerings, Barnes Noble Education is focused on efforts to better align the timing of its cash outflows to course material vendors and cash inflows from collections from schools. As the concentration of digital product sales increases, revenue will be recognized earlier during the academic term as digital textbook revenue is recognized when the customer accesses the digital content compared to: (i) the rental of physical textbooks where revenue is recognized over the rental period, and (ii) a la carte courseware sales where revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of products by Barnes Noble Education customers for products ordered through its websites and virtual bookstores.

Interest and Other Income (loss) - Interest and other income consists primarily of interest and dividend income from cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt and equity securities, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on our marketable equity securities and derivative instruments and realized gains (losses) on our marketable debt securities. 
 Interest and other income, net decreased 3.2 million during the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 , primarily due to a 4.2 million decrease in net gains from investments in marketable equity securities and derivative instruments and a 0.5 million increase in interest income. 
 Interest and other income, net increased 0.4 million during the six months ended October 31, 2024 , compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 0.9 million increase in interest income partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in net gains from investments in marketable equity securities and derivative instruments. 
 Interest expense - Interest expenses primarily consisted of the interest charges related to Barnes Noble Education's credit facility . 
 Provision for income taxes - The changes in the provision for income taxes are described below. 
 Immersion 
 
 Provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 resulted primarily from estimated domestic and foreign taxes included in the calculation of the effective tax rate. We maintain no valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and maintain a valuation allowance against certain our U.S. state and Canadian federal deferred tax assets. The change in the estimated effective tax rate was mainly driven by higher U.S. taxable income which was a result of higher U.S. passive income. 
 The year-over-year change in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from the change in income from continuing operations across various tax jurisdictions. 
 In the event that we determine the deferred tax assets are realizable based on an assessment of relevant factors, an adjustment to the valuation allowance may increase income in the period such determination is made. The valuation allowance does not impact our ability to utilize the underlying net operating loss carryforwards. 
 We also maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions. As of October 31, 2024, we had unrecognized tax benefits under ASC 740 Income Taxes of approximately 7.6 million, all of the 7.6 million could be payable in cash. In addition, interest and penalty of 0.2 million could also be payable in cash in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is 7.6 million. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax provision. We do not expect to have any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. 

 Barnes Noble Education 
 
 Barnes Noble Education recorded an income tax provision of 1.3 million on pre-tax loss of 48.5 million during the period of May 1 st, 2024 to October 31, 2024, which represented an effective income tax rate of 2.6 . 
 
 In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized. As of October 31, 2024, Barnes Noble Education determined that it was more likely than not that it would not realize all deferred tax assets and its tax rate for the current fiscal year reflects this determination. Barnes Noble Education will continue to evaluate this position.

Any stock repurchases may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions, at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10 b 5 - 1 trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10 b 5 - 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, marketable securities and derivative instruments, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
 
 Business Combination 
 
 The results of a business acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, which may be considered preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
 
 We perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocate the purchase price to the respective assets and liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates and selection of comparable companies. We engage the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in concluding fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The resulting fair values and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. 
 
 These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset, an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities, or an impairment of some or all of the goodwill. 
 
 Goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of Barnes Nobel Education was 14.2 million. Barnes Noble Education is a separate reporting unit, and all goodwill was allocated to this reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed for impairment at least annually at year-end, and when triggering events occur between annual impairment tests. 
 
 The identified intangible assets arising from the Barnes Noble acquisition were trade names and customer relationships 95.0 million in aggregate fair value. We determined the fair values of the acquired intangible assets using an income approach with estimated indefinite useful life for the trade name and 13 years for customer relationships. The noncontrolling interest in Barnes Noble Education was valued based on the closing price of Barnes Noble Education s common stock as of June 10, 2024. We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets, or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we assess the likelihood of recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible asset over its remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to an estimated fair value.

Barnes Noble Education 
 
 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue 
 
 Product sales and rentals 
 The majority of Barnes Noble Education's revenue is derived from the sale of products through its bookstore locations, including virtual bookstores, and its bookstore affiliated e-commerce websites, and contains a single performance obligation. Revenue from sales of products is recognized at the point in time when control of the products is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. 
 Product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of its products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by customers for products ordered through websites and virtual bookstores. Product revenue shipped from wholesale operations are recognized upon shipment of physical textbooks at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. Additional revenue is recognized for shipping charges billed to customers and shipping costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs within cost of sale. 
 Revenue from the sale of digital textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is recognized when the customer accesses the digital content as product revenue in Barnes Noble Education's condensed consolidated financial statements. A software feature is embedded within the content of digital textbooks, such that upon expiration of the term the customer is no longer able to access the content. While the sale of the digital textbook allows the customer to access digital content for a fixed period of time, once the digital content is delivered to the customer, our performance obligation is complete. 
 Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer and is recognized as rental income in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Rental periods are typically for a single semester and are always less than one year in duration. Barnes Noble Education offers a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented physical textbook at the end of the rental period if the customer desires to do so. It records the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and pays the buyout option price which is determined at the time of the buyout. In these instances, Barnes Noble Education accelerates any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale. 
 Revenue recognized for our BNC First Day offerings is consistent with Barnes Noble Education's policies outlined above for product, digital and rental sales, net of an anticipated opt-out or return provision. Given the growth of BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in Barnes Noble Education's third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. 
 Barnes Noble Education estimates returns based on an analysis of historical experience. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold in the period that the related sales are recorded. 
 For sales and rentals involving third-party products, we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent. Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. For those transactions where we are the principal, we record revenue on a gross basis, and for those transactions where we are an agent to a third-party, we record revenue on a net basis.

Effective in April 2021, as contemplated by the F/L Relationship related merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of our logo general merchandise sales to Lids and Fanatics. As the logo general merchandise sales are fulfilled by Lids and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo general merchandise sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to the transition. 
 Barnes Noble Education does not have gift cards or customer loyalty programs. Barnes Noble Education do not treat any promotional offers as expenses. Sales tax collected from its customers is excluded from reported revenues. Barnes Noble Education's payment terms are generally 30 days and do not extend beyond one year. 
 Service and other revenue 
 Service and other revenue is primarily derived from brand marketing services which includes promotional activities and advertisements within Barnes Noble Education's physical bookstores and web properties performed on behalf of third-party customers, shipping and handling, non-return rental penalty fees, and revenue from other programs. 
 Merchandise Inventories 
 Merchandise inventories, which consist of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market value of the inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation. 
 Cost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method. Barnes Noble Education's textbook and trade book inventories are valued using the LIFO method and the related reserve was not material to the recorded amount of our inventories. 
 Reserves for non-returnable inventory are based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory. Reserve calculations are sensitive to certain significant assumptions, including markdowns, sales below cost , inventory aging and expected demand. Barnes Noble Education does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the non-returnable inventory reserve. However, if assumptions based on its history of liquidating non-returnable inventory are incorrect, Barnes Noble Education may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 
 For our physical bookstores, we also estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date. Shortage rates are estimated and accrued based on historical rates and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Barnes Noble Education does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate shortage rates. However, if our estimates regarding shortage rates are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 
 Textbook Rental Inventories 
 Physical textbooks out on rent are categorized as textbook rental inventories. At the time a rental transaction is consummated , the book is removed from merchandise inventories and moved to textbook rental inventories at cost. The cost of the book is amortized down to its estimated residual value over the rental period. The related amortization expense is included in cost of goods sold. At the end of the rental period, upon return, the book is removed from textbook rental inventories and recorded in merchandise inventories at its amortized cost. Barnes Noble Education does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate rental cost of goods sold. However, if our estimates regarding residual value are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, and Barnes Noble Education's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 27, 2024 for a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require the management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 . Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 herein, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

 Not applicable. 
 Item 4 . Control and Procedures 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on their evaluation as of October 31, 2024 , our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13 a- 15 (e) and 15 d- 15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 On June 10, 2024, we completed the Transactions with Barnes Noble Education which were accounted for as a business combination. We are currently in the process of assessing Barnes Noble Education s internal controls over financial reporting and integrating Barnes Noble Education with our existing controls over financial reporting. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. Other than incorporating Barnes Noble Education s controls, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Immersion, have been detected.

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Immersion Corporation vs. Xiaomi Group 
 On or about March 3, 2023, the Company initiated patent infringement lawsuits against several companies of the Xiaomi-Group in Germany, France and India (the Xiaomi Litigation ). Immersion filed complaints against Xiaomi-Group companies and their agents in the D sseldorf Regional Court in Germany, the Tribunal judiciaire de Paris (Paris First Instance Civil Court) in France, and the High Court of Delhi, at New Delhi, in India. The complaints alleged that the Xiaomi-Group s devices, including the Xiaomi 12, infringed Immersion's patents that cover various uses of haptic effects in connection with such devices. 
 On June 12, 2024, the Company entered into a Patent License Agreement (the Xiaomi License Agreement with the Xiaomi Group, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to terms for resolving the Xiaomi Litigation and the Xiaomi Group will license, on a non-exclusive basis, the Company s patent portfolio for use in its products. The Xiaomi Litigation was dismissed in October 2024. 
 
 LGE Korean Withholding Tax Matter 
 
 On October 16, 2017, we received a letter from LG Electronics Inc. LGE requesting that we reimburse LGE with respect to withholding tax imposed on LGE by the Korean tax authorities following an investigation where the tax authority determined that LGE failed to withhold on LGE s royalty payments to Immersion Software Ireland Limited from 2012 to 2014. Pursuant to an agreement reached with LGE, on April 8, 2020, the Company provided a provisional deposit to LGE in the amount of KRW 5,916,845,454 (approximately 5.0 million) representing the amount of such withholding tax that was imposed on LGE, which provisional deposit would be returned to us to the extent we ultimately prevail in the appeal in the Korea courts. 
 
 On November 3, 2017, on behalf of LGE, we filed an appeal with the Korea Tax Tribunal regarding their findings with respect to the withholding taxes related to the 2012 to 2017 period. The Korea Tax Tribunal hearing took place on March 5, 2019. On March 19, 2019, the Korea Tax Tribunal issued its ruling in which it decided not to accept our arguments with respect to the Korean tax authorities assessment of withholding tax and penalties imposed on LGE. On behalf of LGE, the Company filed an appeal with the Korea Administrative Court on June 10, 2019. The Company has had numerous hearings before the Korea Administrative Court in the years 2019 through 2022. The Company had a hearing on April 27, 2023, and the Korea Administrative Court rendered a decision on this matter on June 8, 2023, in which it ruled that the withholding taxes and penalties which were imposed by the Korean tax authorities on LGE should be cancelled with litigation costs to be borne by the Korean tax authorities. In connection with the Korea Administrative Court s decision, the Korean tax authorities filed an appeal on June 28, 2023, with the Seoul High Court to seek the cancellation of the lower court s decision. The appellate case is in progress at the Seoul High Court and the first hearing and the hearing took place on November 30, 2023 and February 1, 2024, respectively. However, the next hearing will be set at a later date 
 
 On April 25, 2023, the Company received notice from LGE requesting the Company to reimburse LGE with respect to withholding tax imposed on LGE by the Korean tax authorities following a recent tax audit of LGE for the years 2018 through 2022. Pursuant to an agreement reached with LGE, on June 2, 2023, the Company provided a provisional deposit to LGE in the amount of KRW 3,024,877,044 (approximately 2.3 million) representing the amount of such withholding tax that was imposed on LGE, which provisional deposit would be returned to the Company to the extent the Company ultimately prevails in the appeal in the Korean courts. On June 29, 2023, on behalf of LGE, the Company filed an appeal with the Korea Tax Tribunal regarding their findings with respect to the withholding taxes related to the 2018 to 2022 period. On August 7, 2023, the Korean tax authority submitted its answer against the tax appeal. On September 8, 2023, on behalf of LGE, the Company submitted its rebuttal brief in response thereto. On September 23, 2023, the Korean tax authority, on behalf of LGE, the Company submitted an additional response brief, and on November 23, 2023, the Korea Tax Tribunal rendered a decision against LGE, dismissing the claims of the Company on the grounds that its claims are without merit. In response thereto, on behalf of LGE, the Company filed an appeal with the Korea Administrative Court on December 29, 2023. On July 25, 2024, the Korea Tax Tribunal rendered a decision against LGE, and the deadline for the court appeal of the local income claim is October 21, 2024. In addition, the Korea Administrative Court scheduled a hearing date of August 29, 2024, which was cancelled and will be rescheduled at a later date. On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a complaint and a brief with the Korea Administrative Court for the local income tax appeal. This case has been reassigned due to its significance and the Korean tax authority filed its answer on November 27, 2024.

Immersion Corporation vs. Valve Corporation Valve 
 On May 15, 2023, we filed a complaint against Valve in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, except as set forth below. You should carefully consider the risk factors described in Barnes Noble Education, Inc. s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q which are filed with the SEC and are available at www.sec.gov. 
 
 Our consolidated subsidiary, Barnes Noble Education, is a public company which may expose us to additional costs, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. 
 
 On June 10, 2024, we acquired ownership of approximately 42.0 of the common stock of Barnes Noble Education and as a public company, with a consolidated subsidiary that is also a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies. Many of our personnel and other resources are devoted to ensuring we, and Barnes Noble Education, comply with requirements applicable to public companies. These further exhausts management and other personnel resources that could be used for other revenue-generating activities. 
 
 Changes in Barnes
 Noble Education s relationships with significant clients and suppliers,
including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could
have a material adverse impact on its business. 
 
 The products that Barnes Noble Education sells originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. During fiscal 2024, Barnes Noble Education s four largest retail suppliers, excluding its wholesale business which fulfills orders for all its physical and virtual bookstores, accounted for approximately 28 of its merchandise purchased, with the largest supplier accounting for approximately 7 of its merchandise purchased. Barnes Noble Education s wholesale business sources over 95 of its inventory from two primary channels, approximately 55 from third-party suppliers and approximately 40 from retail bookstores (including its retail bookstores). Suppliers may modify the terms of these relationships due to general economic conditions or otherwise or, especially with respect to wholesale inventory, publishers could terminate distribution to wholesalers, including Barnes Noble Education s wholesale business. 
 
 Barnes Noble Education does not have long-term arrangements with most of its suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content or services, particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. If Barnes Noble Education s current suppliers were to stop selling merchandise, content or services to it on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions or refusal by such suppliers to ship products to us due to delayed or extended payment windows as a result of Barnes Noble Education s own liquidity constraints, Barnes Noble Education may be unable to procure the same merchandise, content or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, delayed or incomplete publisher shipments of physical textbook orders, or delays in receiving digital courseware access codes, could have an adverse impact on sales, including Barnes Noble Education s BNC First Day Complete equitable access program, which relies upon timely receipt of inventory in advance of class start dates each academic term. 
 
 Furthermore, certain of Barnes Noble Education s merchandise is sourced indirectly from outside the United States. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics, and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond its control and could disrupt its supply of foreign-sourced merchandise.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On December 29, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program of up to 50.0 million of our common stock for a period of up to twelve months (the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program ), which terminated and superseded the stock repurchase program that had been approved by the Board on February 23, 2022. Any stock repurchases may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions, at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, including pursuant to one or more Rule 10 b 5 - 1 trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10 b 5 - 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended. Additionally, the Board authorized the use of any derivative or similar instrument to effect stock repurchase transactions, including without limitation, accelerated share repurchase contracts, equity forward transactions, equity option transactions, equity swap transactions, cap transactions, collar transactions, naked put options, floor transactions or other similar transactions or any combination of the foregoing transactions. The December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program was implemented as a method to return value to our stockholders. The timing, pricing and sizes of any repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock and general market and economic conditions. The December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On August 8, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to extend the expiration date of the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program that was set to expire on December 29, 2023, to December 29, 2024. On August 27, 2024, the Board approved an amendment to extend the expiration date of the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program that was set to expire on December 29, 2024, to December 29, 2025. 
 During 2023 , we repurchased 1,217,774 shares of our common stock for 8.3 million at an average purchase price of 6.77 per share. We did not repurchase any stock during the six months ended October 31, 2024. As of October 31, 2024 , we had 41.7 million available for repurchase under the December 2022 Stock Repurchase Program.
