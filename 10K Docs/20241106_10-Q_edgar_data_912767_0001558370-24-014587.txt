 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of the issued equity of that entity, and the remaining of the issued equity is owned by the previous owners Sellers ). The investment in Dempsey is an unconsolidated variable interest entity and we have accounted for it using the equity method of accounting because we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity. Per the contracts, the Sellers have a put right to sell their equity interest to us for million and we have a call right to purchase the Seller s equity interest for million, which are both first exercisable in June 2025 and expire in June 2030. As of September 28, 2024, the carrying value of our investment in Dempsey is million and is recorded in Other Assets. Our maximum exposure to loss consists of our investment amount and any contingent loss that may occur in the future as a result of a change in the fair value of Dempsey relative to the strike price of the put option. In our opinion, the Financial Statements contain all material adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements, and footnotes thereto, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Seasonality has a significant impact on our working capital from March to August, which historically results in negative or modest cash flows from operations in our first and second quarters. Conversely, we experience a substantial decrease in working capital from September to February which typically results in significant cash flow from operations in our third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, we have included the September 30, 2023 balances in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," which is intended to enhance the transparency, decision usefulness and effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require a public entity to disclose a tabular tax rate reconciliation, using both percentages and currency, with specific categories. A public entity is also required to provide a qualitative description of the states and local jurisdictions that make up the majority of the effect of the state and local income tax category and the net amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and also disaggregated by individual jurisdictions. The amendments also remove certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. Although the ASU only modifies our required income tax disclosures, we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation concentrated around the delivery of goods to the carrier, Free On Board (FOB) shipping point. Therefore, revenue is recognized when this performance obligation is satisfied. Generally, title and control passes at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, the customer takes title when the shipment arrives at the destination. However, our shipping process is typically completed the same day. Certain customer products that we provide require installation by the Company or a third party. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion. If we use a third party for installation, the party will act as an agent to us until completion of the installation. Installation revenue represents an immaterial share of our total net sales.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UFP Industries, Inc. is a holding company with subsidiaries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia that design, manufacture, and supply products made from wood, wood and non-wood composites, and other materials to three segments: retail, packaging, and construction. Our business segments are functionally interdependent and are supported by common corporate services, such as accounting and finance, information technology, human resources, marketing, purchasing, transportation, legal and compliance, among others. We regularly invest in automation and implement best practices to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities across each of the segments. The results and improvements from these investments are shared among the segments. This exchange of ideas drives faster innovation for new products, processes, and product improvements. While the majority of our facilities serve only one business segment, many of our larger facilities serve two or more segments. We believe that our operating structure allows us to better evaluate market conditions and opportunities and more effectively allocate capital and resources to the appropriate segments and business units. Also, we believe our diversification and manner in which we operate our business provide an inherent hedge against the business cycles our end markets experience and over which we have limited control. Accordingly, we have the ability to provide more stable earnings and cash flows to our shareholders. Our diversification and operating practices also mitigate the impact that more volatile lumber market conditions have on traditional lumber companies. We are headquartered in Grand Rapids, Mich. This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, that are based on management s beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about the markets we serve, the economy and the Company itself. Words like anticipates, believes, confident, estimates, expects, forecasts, likely, plans, projects, should, variations of such words, and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. These statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, events, or assumptions that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. Actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements are the following: fluctuations in currency and inflation; fluctuations in the price of lumber; adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve; concentration of sales to customers; vertical integration strategies; excess capacity or supply chain challenges; our ability to make successful business acquisitions; government regulations, particularly involving environmental and safety regulations; adverse or unusual weather conditions; inbound and outbound transportation costs; alternatives to replace treated wood products; cybersecurity breaches; tariffs on import and export sales; and potential pandemics. Certain of these risk factors as well as other risk factors and additional information are included in our reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. OVERVIEW Our results for the third quarter of 2024 include the following highlights: Our net sales decreased 10 compared to the third quarter of 2023, which was comprised of a 7 decrease in selling prices and a 3 decrease in unit sales. The overall decrease in our selling prices is primarily due to lower lumber prices and a more competitive pricing environment in certain of our business units. Unit sales declines consisted of 6 in our retail segment, 3 in our packaging segment, and a 1 decrease in our construction segment. Our gross profits decreased by 66 million, or 18.1 , compared to the same period of the prior year. By segment, gross profits decreased by 33 million in Construction, 23 million in Packaging, and 12 million in Retail. The overall decrease in our gross profits is primarily due to the decline in unit sales and unfavorable cost variances resulting from fixed manufacturing costs, and more competitive pricing in certain business units. 

 17 

Table of Contents UFP INDUSTRIES, INC. 
 Our operating profits decreased 47 million, or 28.3 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The overall decrease is a result of the decline in gross profits mentioned above offset by a decrease in selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses. Our SG A declined primarily due to our incentive compensation plans which are tied to profitability and return on investment. Our decremental operating margin was 26.6 , which is calculated by dividing the decrease in our earnings from operations by the decrease in our net sales. In other words, for every dollar decrease in sales from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024, our operating profits decreased 26.6 cents. The decremental operating margin is intended to provide investors additional visibility into expected operating profits during periods of declining sales and pricing. In a declining business cycle, the Company s management uses this metric to evaluate a change in its profitability resulting from a reduction in sales volume while considering the impact of product pricing changes, changes in product sales mix, its ratio of variable and fixed costs, and anticipated cost saving measures, among other factors. Our decremental operating margin was higher this quarter than we ve experienced in other recent down cycles primarily due to more competitive pricing and a cautious approach to reducing our cost structure and capacity as a result of uncertainty about the timing of a rebound in demand. Our cash flows from operations was 498 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 712 million during the first nine months of 2023. The 214 million decline resulted from a decrease in net earnings and non-cash expenses of 50 million and a decline in net working capital since year end that was 164 million lower in the first nine months of 2024 than it was in 2023. In the first nine months of 2023, net working capital declined more significantly as demand normalized from the peak of the pandemic period. Our Cash and cash equivalents at the end of September 2024 was 1.2 billion compared to 957 million at the end of September 2023. Our unused borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities and a shelf agreement with certain lenders along with our cash resulted in total liquidity of approximately 2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024.

A change in lumber prices impacts profitability of products sold with fixed and variable prices, as discussed below. IMPACT OF THE LUMBER MARKET ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS We generally price our products to pass lumber costs through to our customers so that our profitability is based on the value-added manufacturing, distribution, engineering, and other services we provide. As a result, our dollar sales levels (and working capital requirements) are impacted by the lumber costs of our products. Lumber costs were 38.6 and 38.9 of our sales in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross margins are impacted by (1) the relative level of the Lumber Market (i.e. whether prices are higher or lower from comparative periods), and (2) the trend in the market price of lumber (i.e. whether the price of lumber is increasing or decreasing within a period or from period to period). Additionally, as explained below, product categories can be priced differently. Some of our products have fixed selling prices, while the selling prices of other products are indexed to the reported Lumber Market with a fixed dollar adder to cover conversion costs and profits. Consequently, the level and trend of the Lumber Market impact our products differently. Below is a general description of the primary ways in which our products are priced. Products with fixed selling prices. These products include value-added products, such as manufactured items, sold within all segments. Prices for these products are generally fixed at the time of the sales quotation for a specified period of time. In order to reduce any exposure to adverse trends in the price of component lumber products, we attempt to lock in costs with our suppliers or purchase necessary inventory for these sales commitments. The time period limitation eventually allows us to periodically re-price our products for changes in lumber costs from our suppliers.

 Products with selling prices indexed to the reported Lumber Market with a fixed dollar adder to cover conversion costs and profit. These products primarily include treated lumber, panel goods, other commodity-type items, and trusses sold to the manufactured housing industry. For these products, we estimate customers needs and carry appropriate levels of inventory. Because lumber costs are incurred in advance of final sale prices, subsequent increases or decreases in the market price of lumber impact our gross margins. We believe our sales of these products are at their highest relative level in our second quarter, primarily due to pressure-treated lumber sold in our retail segment. 
 For each of the product pricing categories above, our margins are exposed to changes in the trend of lumber prices. As a result of the balance in our net sales to each of our end markets, we believe our gross profits are more stable than those of our competitors who are less diversified. The greatest risk associated with changes in the trend of lumber prices is on the following products: Products with significant inventory levels with low turnover rates, whose selling prices are indexed to the Lumber Market. In other words, the longer the period of time these products remain in inventory, the greater the exposure to changes in the price of lumber. This includes treated lumber, which comprised approximately 22 of our total net sales in the first nine months of 2024. This exposure is less significant with remanufactured lumber, panel goods, other commodity-type items, and trusses sold to the manufactured housing market due to the higher rate of inventory turnover. We attempt to mitigate the risk associated with treated lumber through managed inventory programs with our vendors. We estimate that 18 of our total purchases for the first nine months of 2024 were transacted under these programs. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our annual report on form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Products with fixed selling prices sold under long-term supply arrangements, particularly those involving multi-family construction projects. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our purchasing practices and longer vendor commitments. 
 In addition to the impact of Lumber Market trends on gross margins, changes in the level of the market cause fluctuations in gross margins when comparing operating results from period to period. This is explained in the following example, which assumes the price of lumber has increased from period one to period two, with no changes in the trend within each period. 

Period 1 Period 2 Lumber cost 300 400 Conversion cost 50 50 = Product cost 350 450 Adder 50 50 = Sell price 400 500 Gross margin 12.5 10.0 As is apparent from the preceding example, the level of lumber prices does not impact our overall profits but does impact our margins. Gross margins and operating margins are negatively impacted during periods of high lumber prices; conversely, we experience margin improvement when lumber prices are relatively low. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET PURCHASES We completed one business acquisition in fiscal 2023. The annual historical sales attributable to this acquisition is approximately 38 million. This business combination was not significant to our quarterly results individually or in aggregate and thus pro forma results for 2024 and 2023 are not presented. See Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note F, Business Combinations for additional information.

As a result of the impact of the level of lumber prices on the percentages displayed in the table above (see Impact of the Lumber Market on Our Operating Results), we believe it is useful to compare our change in units sold with our change in gross profits, selling, general, and administrative expenses, and operating profits as presented in the following table.

We believe this ratio provides an enhanced view of our effectiveness in managing these costs given our strategies to enhance our capabilities and improve our value-added product offering and recognizing the higher relative level of SG A these strategies require. This ratio also mitigates the impact of changing lumber prices. The increase in the ratio of SG A as a percentage of gross profit from the prior year is attributable to SG A costs within our Packaging, Construction, and Corporate segments.

 Expanding geographically in our core businesses , domestically and internationally. Increasing our sales of value-added products and enhancing our product offering with new or improved products. Value-added products generally consist of fencing, decking, lattice, and other specialty products sold in the Retail segment; structural and protective packaging and machine-built pallets sold in the Packaging segment; engineered wood components, customized interior fixtures, manufactured and assembled concrete forms sold in the Construction segment; and wood alternative products. Engineered wood components include roof trusses, wall panels, and floor systems. Wood alternative products consist of products manufactured with wood and non-wood composites, metals and plastics sold in each of our segments. Although we consider the treatment of dimensional lumber and panels with certain chemical preservatives a value-added process, treated lumber is not presently included in the value-added sales totals. Remanufactured lumber and panels that are components of finished goods are also generally categorized as commodity-based products. We estimate that approximately 81 of our sales consist of products we manufacture at our locations, while 19 of our sales consist of products manufactured by suppliers that we inventory and distribute to customers.

 Developing new products. We define new products as those that will generate sales of at least 1 million per year within 4 years of launch and are still growing and gaining market penetration and meet our internal definition of value-added products. New product sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 decreased 15 and 11 respectively, primarily due to a decline in unit sales in our structural packaging business unit. Approximately 140.5 million of new product sales for the first nine months of 2023, while still sold, were sunset in 2024 and excluded from the table below because they no longer meet the definition above. Our short-term goal is to achieve annual new product sales of at least 510 million in 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, new product sales totaled 388 million. Our long-term goal is for new products to comprise at least 10 of our total net sales.

Retail Segment Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 13 compared to the same period of 2023 due to a 7 decline in selling prices, a 2 decrease due to the transfer of certain sales to the Construction and Packaging segments, and a 4 decline in units. Unit changes within this segment consisted of decreases of 3 in Deckorators, 4 in UFP Edge, and 5 in ProWood. Our selling prices of variable-priced products declined due to lower lumber prices. The selling prices of these products are indexed to the lumber market at the time they are shipped. Additionally, our unit sales to big box customers, which we believe are more closely correlated with repair and remodel activity, decreased approximately 3 , while unit sales to independent retailers, which we believe are more closely correlated to new housing starts, decreased approximately 8 . Within our Deckorators business unit, our sales of wood-plastic composite decking, mineral-based-composite decking (sold under our new Surestone tradename) and railing systems increased 4 .

 Gross profits decreased by 11.6 million, or 11.1 to 93.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit was attributable to the following : 
 The gross profit of our ProWood business unit decreased by 6.7 million, primarily due to a sequential decline in lumber prices during the quarter which adversely impacted the selling prices of our variable priced products, a decline in unit sales, and fixed manufacturing costs. The products sold by this business unit consist primarily of pressure treated lumber sold at a variable price indexed to the lumber market at the time they are shipped. The gross profit of our Deckorators business unit decreased by 2.9 million due to a decline in unit sales and fixed manufacturing costs. The gross profit of our UFP Edge business unit decreased by 1.0 million, due to a decline in unit sales and fixed manufacturing costs. 
 SG A decreased by approximately 2.9 million, or 5.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accrued bonus expense, which varies with the overall profitability of the segment and return on investment, decreased approximately 1.1 million from the third quarter of 2023 and totaled approximately 12.0 million for the quarter. Sales incentive compensation decreased by 1.2 million compared to last year and was partially offset by an increase in medical benefits. Earnings from operations for the Retail reportable segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 by 4.9 million, or 10.4 , as a result of the factors mentioned above. Net sales in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 15 compared to the same period of 2023, due to a 7 decrease in selling prices, a 2 decrease due to the transfer of certain sales to the Construction and Packaging segments, and a 6 decline in units. Unit changes within this segment consisted of decreases of 2 in Deckorators, 9 in UFP Edge, and 9 in ProWood. Our selling prices of variable-priced products declined due to lower lumber prices. The selling prices of these products are indexed to the lumber market at the time they are shipped. Additionally, unit sales to big box customers decreased approximately 5 , while unit sales to independent retailers decreased approximately 7 . Within our Deckorators business unit, our sales of wood-plastic composite decking, mineral-based-composite decking and railing systems increased 6 . Gross profits decreased by 1.8 million, or 0.6 to 320.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. Our decrease in gross profit was attributable to the following: The gross profits of our ProWood business unit increased 1.5 million in spite of a decline in unit sales and a sequential decline in lumber prices during the year. The products sold by this unit consist primarily of pressure treated lumber sold at a variable price indexed to the lumber market at the time they are shipped. The adverse impact of the decline in lumber prices and lower unit sales was more than offset by favorable results from improvements in inventory management, SKU rationalization, and other operating improvements including the integration of recently acquired businesses. Despite lower unit sales, the gross profit of our Deckorators business unit remained flat compared to last year primarily due to various operating improvements. 
 
 The gross profit of our UFP Edge business unit increased by 0.8 million in spite of lower unit sales primarily due to operating improvements. 
 SG A increased by approximately 2.4 million, or 1.4 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accrued bonus expense, which varies with the overall profitability of the segment and return on investment, increased approximately 4.7 million and totaled approximately 44.7 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales incentive compensation of 1.8 million and several modest decreases in other SG A accounts.

 Earnings from operations for the Retail reportable segment were flat in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of the factors mentioned above and an increase in foreign exchange gains compared to the same period of 2023. Packaging Segment Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 11 compared to the same period of 2023, due to an 8 decrease in selling prices and a 5 decrease in unit sales, partially offset by a 2 increase due to the transfer of sales from the Retail segment. Unit changes consist of a decrease of 10 in structural packaging, primarily due to a decline in demand, partially offset by unit growth of 2 in PalletOne and 4 in Protective Packaging due to market share gains. The decline in prices is due to competitive price pressure as well as lower lumber costs. Gross profits decreased by 22.7 million, or 24.2 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit was attributable to the following: The gross profit of our structural packaging business unit decreased by a total of 18.2 million, in spite of the transfer of certain sales from the Retail segment. The decline in gross profit is attributable to competitive price pressure due to lower demand as well as lower unit sales and resulting unfavorable cost variances due to fixed manufacturing costs. The gross profit of our PalletOne business unit decreased by 4.5 million primarily due to competitive price pressure which more than offset the favorable impact from unit sales growth. The gross profit of our protective packaging business unit was flat compared to last year. 
 SG A decreased by approximately 3.2 million, or 6.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accrued bonus expense, which varies with the overall profitability of the segment and return on investment, decreased approximately 4.9 million relative to the third quarter of 2023, and totaled 8.5 million for the quarter. Sales incentives also decreased this quarter. These decreases were partially offset by increases in wages, benefits, and professional fees. Earnings from operations for the Packaging reportable segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 by 19.6 million, or 47.2 , due to the factors discussed above. Net sales in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 11 compared to the same period of 2023, due to an 8 decrease in selling prices and a 6 decrease in unit sales, partially offset by a 3 increase due to the transfer of sales from the Retail segment. Unit changes consist of decreases of 11 in structural packaging and 7 in protective packaging, primarily due to a decline in demand. These declines were partially offset by 7 unit growth in PalletOne due to market share gains. The decline in prices is due to competitive price pressure as well as lower lumber costs. Gross profits decreased by 92.7 million, or 27.8 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in gross profits was attributable to the following. The gross profit of our structural packaging business unit decreased by a total of 68.7 million, in spite of the transfer of certain sales from the Retail segment. The decline in gross profit is attributable to competitive price pressure due to lower demand as well as lower unit sales and resulting unfavorable cost variances due to fixed manufacturing costs. The gross profit of our PalletOne business unit decreased by 21.5 million primarily due to competitive price pressure which more than offset the favorable impact from unit sales growth. The gross profit of our protective packaging business unit decreased by 2.5 million due to a decline in unit sales and fixed manufacturing costs.

 SG A decreased by approximately 23.9 million, or 13.2 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accrued bonus expense, which varies with the overall profitability of the segment and return on investment, decreased approximately 15.4 million, and totaled 29.8 million for the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, our sales incentive compensation decreased by 8.6 million. Earnings from operations for the Packaging reportable segment decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 by 70.4 million, or 46.0 , due to the factors discussed above. Construction Segment Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 8 compared to the same period of 2023 and consists of a unit decrease of 1 and a 7 decrease in selling prices. We experienced unit declines of 6 in commercial construction, 7 in concrete forming, and 8 in site built, primarily due to softer demand. These declines were substantially offset by an 11 increase in factory-built, primarily due to an increase in industry production. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we estimate that our backlog of orders in our site-built construction business unit were 80 million and 91 million, respectively. The decline in pricing was primarily due to competitive price pressure. Gross profits decreased by 33.1 million, or 22.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease in our gross profit was comprised of the following: 
 The gross profit of our site-built construction business unit decreased by 29.0 million, primarily due to a decline in unit sales, unfavorable cost variances due to fixed manufacturing costs and competitive price pressure. The gross profit of our concrete forming business unit decreased by 0.8 million due to lower unit sales. The gross profit of our commercial construction business unit decreased by 2.0 million as a result of lower unit sales. The gross profit of our factory-built business unit decreased by 1.3 million in spite of higher unit sales primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix. 
 SG A decreased by approximately 6.2 million, or 8.3 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accrued bonus expense declined by 6.0 million and totaled 13.6 million for the quarter. In addition, declines in sales and certain other incentives were offset by increases in wages and benefit costs. Earnings from operations for the Construction reportable segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 by 27.2 million, or 39.0 , due to the factors mentioned above. Net sales in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 1 compared to the same period of 2023, consisting of a 7 decrease in selling prices partially offset by a 5 unit increase and a 1 increase due to the transfer of certain sales from the Retail segment. The unit increase was comprised of increases of 14 in factory-built, primarily due to an increase in industry production, and 4 in site-built, primarily due to market share gains resulting from capacity expansion and new products. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 7 in commercial construction and 10 in concrete forming due to lower demand. Gross profits decreased by 52.1 million, or 12.9 , for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease in our gross profit was comprised of the following: 
 The gross profit of our site-built construction business unit decreased by 46.9 million, primarily due to reduced margins on multi-family construction projects, which were impacted by lower lumber pricing this year, and more competitive price pressure.

 The gross profit of our concrete forming business unit decreased by 6.2 million in spite of the transfer of sales from the Retail segment due to lower unit sales and a more competitive pricing. The gross profit of our commercial construction business unit decreased by 3.4 million as a result of lower unit sales. The above decreases were offset by an increase in the gross profit in factory-built of 4.4 million as a result of increased unit sales and favorable cost variances resulting from fixed manufacturing costs, as well as the transfer of sales from the Retail segment. 
 SG A decreased by approximately 5.2 million, or 2.4 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accrued bonus expenses, which varies with the overall profitability and return on investment of the segments, decreased by 7.2 million and totaled 43.9 million for the first nine months of 2024. In addition, sales and other incentives decreased by 6.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in wages and benefits of 7.4 million and professional fees of 2.0 million. Earnings from operations for the Construction reportable segment decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 by 46.0 million, or 24.8 , due to the factors mentioned above. All Other Segment Our All Other reportable segment consists of our International and Ardellis (our insurance captive) segments that are not significant. Corporate The corporate segment consists of over (under) allocated costs that are not significant. INCOME TAXES Effective tax rates differ from statutory federal income tax rates, primarily due to provisions for foreign, state and local income taxes and permanent tax differences. Our effective tax rate was 24.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 22.7 in the same period of 2023 and was 22.3 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 23.3 for the same period in 2023. The increase in our effective tax rate for the third quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit we recognized for an R D tax credit in the quarter. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in our tax deduction from stock-based compensation accounted for as a permanent difference. OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS We have no significant off-balance sheet transactions.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The table below presents, for the periods indicated, a summary of our cash flow statement (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, 2024 2023 Cash from operating activities 497,662 711,803 Cash used in investing activities (177,488) (187,548) Cash used in financing activities (245,683) (126,224) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (5,179) 3,199 Net change in all cash and cash equivalents 69,312 401,230 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 1,122,256 559,623 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period 1,191,568 960,853 In general, we fund our growth through a combination of operating cash flows, our revolving credit facility, and issuance of long-term notes payable at times when interest rates are favorable. We have not issued equity to finance growth except in the case of a large acquisition that occurred many years ago. We manage our capital structure by attempting to maintain a targeted ratio of debt to equity and debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe this is one of many important factors to maintaining a strong credit profile, which in turn helps ensure timely access to capital when needed. Seasonality has a significant impact on our working capital due to our primary selling season which occurs during the period from March to September. Consequently, our working capital typically increases during our first and second quarters resulting in negative or modest cash flows from operations during those periods. Conversely, we tend to experience a substantial decrease in working capital once we move beyond our peak selling season which typically results in significant cash flows from operations in our third and fourth quarters. Due to the seasonality of our business and the effects of the Lumber Market, we believe our cash cycle (days of sales outstanding plus days supply of inventory less days of payables outstanding) is a good indicator of our working capital management. As indicated in the table below, our cash cycle decreased to 59 days from 62 days during the third quarter of 2024 and decreased to 59 days from 65 days during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period. 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Days of sales outstanding 36 37 35 36 Days supply of inventory 36 38 36 41 Days of payables outstanding (13) (13) (12) (12) Days in cash cycle 59 62 59 65 The decrease in our days supply of inventory for the quarter and first nine months of 2024 is due to improvements in inventory turns in our Construction and Packaging segments. The decrease in our days of sales outstanding is primarily due to improvements in our Construction segment. We continue to focus on past due account balances with customers, and the percentage of our accounts receivable that are current was 93 and 94 at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the first nine months of 2024, our cash flows from operations were 498 million and were comprised of net earnings of 349 million, 134 million of non-cash expenses, and a 14 million increase in working capital since the end of December 2023. Our cash flows from operations decreased by 214 million compared to the same period of last year primarily due to the decrease in our investment in net working capital since year end, which was 164 million lower in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023 our net working capital declined significantly as a result of demand normalizing from the peak of the pandemic period.

Table of Contents UFP INDUSTRIES, INC. 
 Purchases of property, plant, and equipment of 165 million comprised most of our cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024. Net purchases of investments totaled 34.3 million while total proceeds from the sale of investments totaled 13.8 million. Outstanding purchase commitments on existing capital projects totaled approximately 163 million on September 28, 2024. Capital spending primarily consists of several projects to expand capacity to manufacture new and value-added products, primarily in our Packaging segment and Site-Built, Deckorators and ProWood business units, achieve efficiencies through automation in all segments, and make improvements to a number of facilities. We intend to fund capital expenditures and purchase commitments through our operating cash flows for the balance of the year. Cash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 primarily consisted of the following: We repurchased 1,399,944 shares of our common stock for 159.0 million for the year at an average price of 113.55 per share. Of this amount, 154,196 shares were repurchased in order to settle tax withholding obligations of long-term stock incentive plan participants awards which vested in February. The shares were purchased at an average price of 115.69 per share, totaling 17.8 million. Dividends paid during the first nine months of 2024 were 60.7 million 0.33 per share). Contingent consideration payments of 4.8 million. Distributions to noncontrolling interests of 11.8 million. Purchase of remaining noncontrolling interest of subsidiary of 4.9 million. Debt repayment on behalf of an investee of 6.3 million. 
 On September 28, 2024, we had 2.0 million outstanding on our 750 million revolving credit facility, and we had approximately 711 million in remaining availability after considering 37 million in outstanding letters of credit. Financial covenants on the unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured notes include minimum interest tests and a maximum leverage ratio. The agreements also restrict the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur and the amount of assets which may be sold. We were in compliance with all our covenant requirements on September 28, 2024. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, we had approximately 2.4 billion in total liquidity, consisting of our cash, remaining availability under our revolving credit facility, and a shelf agreement with certain lenders providing up to 535 million in remaining borrowing capacity. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND REGULATIONS See Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, Note E, Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. We continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures. There have been no material changes in our policies or estimates since December 30, 2023.

 FORWARD OUTLOOK Our long-term financial goals include: Growing our annual unit sales by 7-10 . We anticipate smaller tuck in acquisitions will continue to contribute toward this goal; Achieving and sustaining a 12.5 adjusted EBITDA margin by continuing to enhance our capabilities and grow our portfolio and sales of value-added products and by achieving operating improvements; Earning an incremental return on new investment over our cost of capital; and Maintaining a conservative capital structure. 
 We believe effectively executing our strategies will allow us to achieve long-term goals in the future. However, demand in the markets we serve has contracted, which will impact our results and vary depending on the severity and duration of this cycle. The following factors should be considered when evaluating our future prospects: Lumber prices, which impact our cost of goods sold and selling prices, have normalized due to additional sawmill capacity and demand falling from peak levels. We anticipate lumber prices will remain at lower levels until there is a change in the balance of supply and demand. Recent curtailments in production capacity by sawmills and impact of severe storm activity may contribute to an improvement in the balance in supply and demand in 2025. Retail sales accounted for 40 of our net sales for the first nine months of 2024. When evaluating future demand for the segment, we analyze data such as the same-store sales growth of national home improvement retailers and forecasts of home remodeling activity. Based on this data, we currently anticipate market demand for our products to be down mid-single digits for the balance of 2024. Market share gains may help offset some of the impact of weaker demand. Packaging sales accounted for 24 of our net sales for the first nine months of 2024. When evaluating future demand, we consider a variety of metrics, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), durable goods manufacturing, and U.S. real GDP. We currently believe overall demand for our products in the markets we serve to be down mid to high-single digits for the balance of 2024. Market share gains may help offset some of the impact of weaker demand. Construction sales accounted for 31 of our net sales for the first nine months of 2024. - The site-built business unit accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales for the first nine months of 2024. Approximately one-third of site-built customers are multifamily builders. Independent forecasts of housing starts have recently been revised downward and generally range from a low to a mid-single digit decline. Market share gains may help offset some of the impact of weaker demand. - The factory-built housing business unit accounted for 12 of our net sales for the first nine months of 2024. When evaluating future demand, we analyze data from production and shipments of manufactured housing. Early in the year, the National Association of Home Builders and John Burns Real Estate Consulting forecast the manufactured home shipments in 2024 to be flat to slightly up . Manufactured housing is expected to continue to benefit from broader economic trends, including demand for affordable housing options, and we expect market demand for our products that serve manufactured housing to be up mid- to high-single digits for the balance of 2024. Market share gains may contribute to unit growth. - The commercial construction and concrete forming business units accounted for approximately 6 of our net sales for the first nine months of 2024. When evaluating future demand, we analyze data from non-residential construction spending. We currently anticipate overall demand in these business units to be slightly down for the balance of 2024 .

 Capital Allocation: We believe the strength of our cash flow generation and conservative capital structure provide us with sufficient resources to grow our business and also fund returns to our shareholders. We plan to continue to pursue a balanced and return-driven approach to capital allocation across dividends, share buybacks, capital investments and acquisitions. Specifically: On October 23, 2024, our board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.33 per share, which represents a 10 year over year increase. This dividend is payable on December 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on December 2, 2024. We continue to consider our payout ratio and yield when determining the appropriate dividend rate and have a long-term objective of increasing our dividend in line with our earnings growth. On July 24, 2024, our board authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million worth of our shares through July 31, 2025. This share authorization supersedes and replaces our prior share repurchase authorizations. Our objective is to repurchase our stock at sufficient amounts to offset issuances under our share-based compensation plans. In addition, we will opportunistically buy shares when the price trades at pre-determined levels. Through September 28, 2024, no shares were repurchased pursuant to this authorization. Our targeted range for capital expenditures for 2024 is 250- 300 million, which will continue to be impacted by extended lead times required for most equipment and rolling stock as well as the time required for site selection in the case of investments in new locations. Priority continues to be given to projects that enhance the working environments of our plants and take advantage of automation opportunities, expand our transportation capacity, and drive strategies that have strong long-term growth potential for new and value-added products. Approximately 295 million in capital projects have been approved in 2024 and another 55 million are pending approval We continue to pursue a healthy pipeline of acquisition opportunities of companies that are a strong strategic fit and enhance our capabilities while providing higher margin, return, and growth potential. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which consists of a revolving credit facility and industrial development revenue bonds. We do not currently enter into any material interest rate swaps, futures contracts or options on futures, or other types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value, but not earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value, but do affect future earnings and cash flows. We do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity, and as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance it. We are subject to fluctuations in the price of lumber. We experience significant fluctuations in the cost of commodity lumber products from primary producers (the Lumber Market ). A variety of factors over which we have no control, including government regulations, transportation, environmental regulations, weather conditions, economic conditions, and natural disasters, impact the cost of lumber products and our selling prices. While we attempt to minimize our risk from severe price fluctuations, substantial, prolonged trends in lumber prices can affect our sales volume, our gross margins, and our profitability. We anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in the future. (See Impact of the Lumber Market on Our Operating Results. Our international operations have exposure to foreign currency rate risks, primarily due to fluctuations in their local currency, which is their functional currency, compared to the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, certain of our operations enter into transactions that will be settled in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar. We may enter into forward foreign exchange rate contracts in the future to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk. Historically, our hedge contracts have been immaterial to the financial statements.
