CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements contained in this Current Report on Form 10-Q other than historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, as such, may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of ExchangeRight Income Fund, d/b/a the ExchangeRight Essential Income REIT (the Company to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For these statements, the Company claims the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may , will , should , estimates , projects , anticipates , believes , expects , intends , future , and words of similar import, or the negative thereof. Forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 10-Q include information about possible or assumed future events, including, among other things, discussion and analysis of our future financial condition, results of operations, our strategic plans and objectives, occupancy, leasing rates and trends, liquidity and ability to meet future obligations, anticipated expenditures of capital and other matters. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this Form 10-Q is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Any such forward-looking statements are subject to unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which in some cases are beyond our control, and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, provide distributions to shareholders, and maintain the value of our real estate properties, may be significantly hindered. 
 
 Factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: 
 
 risks inherent in the real estate business, including tenant defaults, illiquidity of real estate investments, potential liability relating to environmental matters and potential damages from natural disasters; 

general business and economic conditions; 

the accuracy of our assessment that certain businesses are e commerce resistant and recession resilient; 

the accuracy of the tools we use to determine the creditworthiness of our tenants; 

concentration of our business within certain tenant categories; 

ability to renew leases, lease vacant space or re lease space as existing leases expire; 

our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategies; 

the degree and nature of our competition; 

inflation and interest rate fluctuations; 

failure, weakness, interruption or breach in security of our information systems; 

our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness; 

continued volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets and broader financial markets; 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust REIT for federal income tax purposes; 

our limited operating history as a REIT, which may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders; 

current loans, or future loans, may be subject to certain unfavorable provisions or may not be able to be refinanced; 

changes in, or the failure or inability to comply with, applicable laws or regulations; and 

future sales or issuances of our common shares or other securities convertible into our common shares, or the perception thereof, could cause the value of our common shares to decline and could result in dilution. 

The foregoing list is only a summary of the principal risks that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The foregoing should be read in conjunction with the complete discussion of risk factors we face, which are set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2024.

Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities 

The valuation of the liability for the Company s interest rate swap, which is measured on a recurring basis, was determined to be Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy and was based on independent values provided by a financial instrument valuation specialist. Such valuation was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of the derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual term of the swap, including the period to maturity, and user-observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves significant other observable inputs ). The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. The Company has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the fair value associated with the significant unobservable inputs relating to the Company s risk of non-performance was insignificant to the overall fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and, as a result, the relevant inputs for purposes of calculating the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, in their entirety, were based upon significant other observable inputs .

 The Company has elected and is qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2019. The Company is the sole general partner and a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on January 9, 2019. Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through the Operating Partnership. The Trust Properties are owned and controlled by the Company and are managed by the Property Manager and the Asset Manager, which are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of ExchangeRight, pursuant to executed management agreements with each respective entity. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment continued, driven by concerns over geopolitical conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the aggregate effects of inflation generated over the last three years, continued elevated interest rate levels, and uneven economic growth. While overall inflation rates have moderated on a year-over-year basis during 2024, the aggregate effects of the elevated inflation levels experienced from 2021 to 2023 compared to historical norms in many major economies around the world has continued to create economic pressures in the U.S. and many other nations. While the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, there remains uncertainty as to what extent the Federal Reserve and other central banks will continue to ease monetary policy over the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, if at all. 
 
 Substantially all of the Company s tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes or insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. The Company has not been materially impacted in the current period by elevated interest rate levels as all of its mortgage debt is currently effectively fixed-rate financing as of September 30, 2024. To the extent the Company utilizes its revolving credit facilities in the future, it may be impacted by fluctuating interest rates as the interest on the revolving credit facility is not fixed. Further inflation rate increases or elevated interest rates over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent events and any future changes in interest rates or inflation. 
 
 Highlights for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 The September 2024 distribution marked the 66 th consecutive month of providing stable distributions to our investors. We have increased the distribution we pay five times since our inception. The Company declared distributions totaling 31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cumulative inception-to-date cash flows from operating activities have funded 100 of our cumulative inception-to-date distributions. The Company s current 
 21 

distributions represent a 6.37 annualized return, based on the 0.1449 per share distribution rate and 27.29 NAV per share as of September 30, 2024. The following table details the annualized distribution rate based on the 0.1449 per share distribution rate in effect as of September 30, 2024 and current offering price of the Company s common shares:

(a) The annualized distribution rate is calculated by the September 30, 2024 distribution rate in effect of 0.1449 per share divided by the offering price per share in connection with the Company s September 30, 2024 NAV declaration. The Company believes the annualized distribution rate is a useful measure of our overall investment performance. 

(b) Total return is calculated as the change in NAV per share at the end of the respective period versus the respective share class offering price per share at the beginning of the respective period plus any distributions per share declared during the period. The Company believes total return is a useful measure of the overall investment performance of our shares. 

Leasing 
 
 The Company s portfolio is 98.5 leased and its weighted average lease term as of September 30, 2024 is 6.1 years. The Company executed 13 lease renewals during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with average lease extensions of 60 months and average new rents over rents prior to the renewal of 6.8 for the period. The Company also executed 2 new leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with an average lease term of 73 months. 
 
 Capital 
 
 On May 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership (as the borrower) and the Company entered into a credit agreement which provides the Company with a revolving credit facility of up to a maximum amount of 75.0 million with a maturity date of May 30, 2027. The revolving credit facility may be increased to 400.0 million, upon request of the Operating Partnership, subject to, among other things, the receipt of commitments for the increased amount. On July 23, 2024, the Operating Partnership and the Company increased the revolving credit facility in the amount of 25.0 million pursuant to an incremental revolving commitment from an additional lender under the terms of the credit agreement. The additional commitment increased the Company s borrowing capacity under the credit agreement s revolving credit facility to 100.0 million. The Operating Partnership will have the option to select loans as either a (i) base rate loan, (ii) term SOFR loan (with a one, three or six months tenor), or (iii) daily simple SOFR loan (as in effect from time to time), each of which is subject to an applicable margin that varies based on a ratio of the total indebtedness and total asset value of the Company as defined within the agreement. Interest on base rate loans and daily simple SOFR loans shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month. Interest on term SOFR loans will be payable at the end of each interest period, and in the case of interest periods longer than three months, quarterly. The entire outstanding principal and any accrued interest thereon will be due and payable on the maturity date. The Operating Partnership is also required to pay an unused commitment fee on the difference between committed amounts under the revolving credit facility and the amounts actually used under the revolving credit facility, which is (i) 0.25 per annum when usage of the revolving credit facility is less than 50 , and (ii) 0.15 per annum when usage of the revolving credit facility is greater than or equal to 50 . The credit facility contains financial covenants including, but not limited to, maximum debt leverage, maximum secured debt, minimum fixed charge coverage, and minimum net worth. In addition, the facility contains restrictions including, but not limited to, limits on indebtedness, certain investments and distributions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has borrowed 44.0 million under this credit facility and is in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 
 The Company has not had a material immediate term impact from the current elevated interest rate environment as all of its outstanding mortgage loans payable are effectively fixed as of September 30, 2024. The Company has experienced regular net inflows of shareholder capital. All redemption requests, representing approximately 5.0 of inception-to-date total equity raised through September 30, 2024, have been fully satisfied.

(a) NN or Double Net means leases where landlord will have some obligations for roof, parking lot, and/or building structure but where the tenant remains obligated for operating costs of property taxes, insurance, and property maintenance. 

(b) NNN or Triple Net means leases where the tenant is obligated pursuant to its lease for the costs of property taxes, insurance, and property maintenance, often including both repairs and replacements. 

(c) GLA means gross leasable area. 

(d) Annualized base rent per square foot is calculated as the aggregate, annualized contractual minimum rent for all occupied spaces divided by the aggregate GLA of all occupied spaces as of September 30, 2024. Tenant concessions and abatements are reflected in this measure. Furthermore, from time to time, a limited number of short-term (generally one to three months) free rent concessions may be provided to tenants prior to initial occupancy or upon a renewal extension. As of September 30, 2024, no tenants were in a free rent concession period.

For a description of the material terms of the credit agreement and revolving credit facility thereunder, see Capital above.

 Common Shares and Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 On May 30, 2024, the Company classified and designated a new class of common shares of beneficial interest, 0.01 par value per share of the Company designated as Class ER Common Shares. Each Class ER Common Shareholder will have the right, upon the seventh anniversary of the closing date of a shareholder s purchase of Class ER Common Shares (subject to three one-year extensions in the Trustee s discretion), to require the Company to redeem the Class ER Common Shares, in whole or in part, held by such shareholder, as well as the right to convert such Class ER Commons Share to Class I Common Shares on 
 26 

a 1:1 basis. Each Class ER Common Shareholder desiring to exercise the redemption rights must give written notice of redemption to the Company at least 15 calendar days prior to the scheduled redemption date. Subject to applicable law, the Company will effect any redemption by paying cash for each Class ER Common Share to be redeemed equal to the original purchase price per share paid by the redeeming shareholder for the Class ER Common Shares. The Class ER Common Shares have no other redemption rights and are not eligible for repurchase or redemption under the Company s share repurchase program. 
 
 The Class ER Common Shares are subject to conversion under certain circumstances. First, the Class ER Common Shares are subject to mandatory conversion upon a conversion event, which is generally defined as a listing of the Common Shares on a national securities exchange or a change in control transaction involving the Operating Partnership or the Company. In this regard, each Class ER Common Share will automatically and without any action on the part of the shareholder convert into an equal number of Class I Common Shares of the Company, on a 1:1 basis, upon a conversion event, unless, at least five days before the effective date of such conversion event, the Trustee determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such conversion shall not occur in connection with such conversion event. Any such determination will not preclude the conversion of Class ER Common Shares into Class I Common Shares in connection with the occurrence of any successive conversion event. 
 
 The Class ER Common Shares are also subject to the optional conversion rights of the Company. In this regard, from and after the fifth anniversary of the closing date of a Class ER Common Shareholder s purchase of Class ER Common Shares, the Trustee, on behalf of the Company, will have the right to cause each Class ER Common Shareholder, without any action on the part of the shareholder, to convert any or all of such holder s Class ER Common Shares into an equal number of Class I Common Shares, on a 1:1 basis. The Trustee will provide written notice to the affected shareholder of its intent to exercise the conversion rights described in the preceding sentence no less than 30 calendar days prior to any such conversion date. 
 
 Except as otherwise specifically set forth above, the Class ER Common Shares have the same preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications, and terms and conditions as the Class A Common Shares, Class I Common Shares and Class S Common Shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has issued 64,404 Class ER Common Shares.

Rental revenues consist of base rents, tenant reimbursables, straight-line rent adjustments, above and below market lease amortization, net and lease termination income. Rental revenues increased 0.5 million, or 2.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of one property on May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023. The rental revenues associated with these properties were 1.4 million and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was offset by a decrease in lease termination income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest income on notes receivable from affiliates includes interest earned from (1) outstanding advances under the RSLCA which bears interest at a rate equal to 12.0 per annum in addition to an Unused Facility Fee and an Annual Access Fee, (2) a 3.6 million real estate note receivable from an affiliated party and (3) a 2.4 million note receivable from an affiliated party. Interest income from the RSLCA increased 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the Amendment to the RSLCA agreement entered into on September 18, 2024 in which the Company now earns an Unused Facility Fee and an Annual Access Fee. 
 
 Property operating expenses decreased 0.1 million, or 2.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in property operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in general repairs and maintenance costs. These decreases were offset by an increase in property operating expenses due to the acquisition of one property on May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023. 
 
 Management fees to affiliates decreased 0.3 million, or 61.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Asset management fees decreased 0.4 million and property management fees remained consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Asset management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 0.5 million of earned fees per the management agreement, net of 0.4 million of fees which were irrevocably waived by the asset manager. Property management fees consisted of 0.2 million of earned fees per the management agreement. 
 
 General and administrative expenses remained consistent, totaling 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of audit, tax and legal fees. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization remained consistent, totaling 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Depreciation and amortization during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was impacted by the acquisition of one property on May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023. The depreciation and amortization increases associated with these properties totaled 0.8 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of certain intangible assets being fully depreciated. 
 
 Interest expense increased 0.9 million, or 12.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of (1) an increase in interest expense of 0.9 million related to the Company s borrowings under its revolving lines of credit, (2) the assumption of a 43.5 million mortgage loan payable in connection with the acquisition of 15 properties via a merger agreement with one former 1031-exchangeable portfolio on August 31, 2023, and (3) an increase of 0.5 million in amortization of below market debt associated with the assumption of mortgage loans payable. These increases were offset by an 0.8 million decrease in interest expense on certain mortgage debts that were paid off upon maturity.

Rental revenues consist of base rents, tenant reimbursables, straight-line rent adjustments, above and below market lease amortization, net and lease termination income. Rental revenues increased 2.6 million, or 4.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of one property on May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023. The rental revenues associated with these properties were 4.0 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was offset by a decrease in lease termination income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest income on notes receivable from affiliates includes interest earned from (1) outstanding advances under the RSLCA which bears interest at a rate equal to 12.0 per annum in addition to an Unused Facility Fee and an Annual Access Fee, (2) a 3.6 million real estate note receivable from an affiliated party and (3) a 2.4 million note receivable from an affiliated party. Interest income from the RSLCA was 0.2 million lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of an approximate 5.6 million decrease in the average daily outstanding balance of the RSLCA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was slightly offset by an increase in interest income from the RSLCA as a result of the Amendment to the RSLCA agreement entered into on September 18, 2024 in which the Company now earns an Unused Facility Fee and an Annual Access Fee. 
 
 Property operating expenses increased 0.4 million, or 5.3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in property operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the acquisition of one property on May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023 as well as an increase in taxes in certain jurisdictions. These increases were offset by decreases in general repairs and maintenance. 
 
 Management fees to affiliates decreased 1.2 million, or 67.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Asset management fees decreased 1.1 million and property management fees decreased 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Asset management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 1.4 million of earned fees per the management agreement, net of 1.2 million of fees which were irrevocably waived by the asset manager. Property management fees consisted of 0.6 million of earned fees per the management agreement, net of 0.2 million of fees which were irrevocably waived by the property manager. 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 million, or 39.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in audit, tax and legal fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred additional audit and legal fees in connection with its Form 10 registration statement. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 0.4 million, or 2.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to the acquisition of one property on 
 29 

May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023. The depreciation and amortization associated with these properties totaled 2.3 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of certain intangible assets being fully depreciated. 
 
 Provision for impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the impairment of one property. The estimation and evaluation of this impairment charge relies on judgments and assumptions made by management in determining the impairment charge to record. It is possible that such judgments and/or estimates will change; if this occurs, we may recognize additional impairment charges for this property or other properties owned by the Company. 
 
 Interest expense increased 2.6 million, or 12.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of (1) the assumption of a 43.5 million mortgage loan payable from the acquisition of 15 properties via merger agreements with one former 1031-exchangeable portfolios on August 31, 2023, (2) an increase in interest expense of 1.6 million related to the Company's borrowings under its revolving lines of credit, and (3) an increase of 0.6 million in amortization of below market debt associated with the assumption of mortgage loans payable. These increases were offset by a slight decrease in interest expense on the Company s mortgage debt as certain mortgage debt was paid off upon maturity. 
 
 Gain on land condemnation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the receipt of funds related to an easement at one of the Company s properties. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company has historically funded, and expects to continue to fund, short-term liquidity requirements, including debt service and distributions to our shareholders and distributions to holders of noncontrolling interests, from its operations. The Company funds acquisitions and certain capital expenditures primarily from the sale of shares of its Class I, Class A, and Class ER Common Shares, the issuance of additional OP Units, and through the assumption or incurrence of debt. The Company believes that its current liquidity position is sufficient to meet its expected acquisition activity. We expect to fund our current liquidity requirements from a combination of cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations, secured financings or a line of credit. 
 
 The Company s strategy targets properties with net leases to insulate our shareholders from rising costs and surprise repair costs that affect other types of real estate investments. Longer lease terms primarily with investment-grade national tenants successfully operating in historically recession-resilient sectors are also intended to provide stable income that can help bridge economic cycles. 
 
 The Company has invested in the ExchangeRight Mezz Loans for the DST programs under the RSLCA. The loan agreement, as amended, matures on April 4, 2027 and bears interest at a rate equal to 12.0 per annum, while outstanding. On September 18, 2024, the Company entered into the Amendment to the Restated and Uncommitted Senior Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with ExchangeRight. For a description of the Amendment, see RSLCA Notes Receivable from Related Party above. 
 
 ExchangeRight structured the RSLCA, including the 12.0 interest rate, as a way to provide an enhanced risk-adjusted return to the Company. The current capacity under the RSLCA is a maximum of 250.0 million outstanding at any time. ExchangeRight had net borrowings of 19.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increasing the balance of the RSLCA notes receivable to 42.0 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company s notes receivable under the RSLCA are secured by interests in an entity that indirectly owns net-leased necessity-based retail properties similar to the Company s acquired properties, as well as a pledge agreement and subordination agreement provided by ExchangeRight. As a result, the risk profile of an investment in this program is intended to be similar to ownership of the Company s acquired properties while providing liquidity and an enhanced risk-adjusted return over investments with similar liquidity. 
 
 In order to continue qualifying as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income , as defined in the Code. The Company paid monthly distributions relating to its common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While the Company intends to continue paying regular monthly distributions, future distribution declarations will continue to be at the discretion of the Trustee, and will depend on the cash flow and financial condition of the Company, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Trustee may deem relevant. 
 30 

On May 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership (as the borrower) and the Company entered into a credit agreement which currently provides the Company with a revolving credit facility of up to a maximum amount of 100.0 million with a maturity date of May 30, 2027.

 In January 2021, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit agreement, as amended in December 2023, had a maturity date of January 15, 2025, and bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate currently in effect with an interest rate floor of 6.00 , while outstanding. The unsecured revolving line of credit required monthly interest only payments, while outstanding. On January 16, 2024, the Company borrowed 15.0 million on its unsecured revolving line of credit, which was repaid in full on May 31, 2024. Upon this repayment, this unsecured revolving line of credit was terminated. 
 
 On May 19, 2021, ExchangeRight entered into a revolving line of credit in which the Company has access to utilize available capacity under this revolving line of credit. The Company is legally responsible for the specific borrowings related to the Company, whereas ExchangeRight is the guarantor on all outstanding borrowings in relation to this revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit agreement, as amended in December 2023, now has a maturity date of December 22, 2026, with a maximum aggregate amount being borrowed by the Company and ExchangeRight totaling 80.0 million outstanding at any time and requires monthly payments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this secured revolving line of credit and ExchangeRight had 12.1 million outstanding, resulting in 67.9 million available for borrowing by the Company and ExchangeRight as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The interest only period bore interest at a rate equal to the prime rate. The amortization principal period required payments at the current interest rate.

(b) Mortgage bears interest at a variable-rate of 1.70 in excess of SOFR and concurrent with the closing of the mortgage, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted the variable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage. Accordingly, this mortgage has been presented as a fixed-rate mortgage. 

(c) The Company repaid the 16.9 million mortgage loan payable by its contractual maturity date of October 1, 2024.

(a) The Company repaid the 16.9 million mortgage loan payable by its contractual maturity date of October 1, 2024 . 

The mortgage loans payable mature at various dates from October 2024 through January 2031. The Company intends to repay the mortgage debt maturing in 2025 with either available cash, proceeds from repayments under the RSLCA, secured debt financing, unsecured debt financing, or a combination of these options. Mortgage loans payable may require the Company to deposit certain replacement and other reserves with its lenders. Such restricted cash is generally available only for property-level requirements for which the reserves have been established and is not available to fund other property-level or Company-level obligations. The Company had 11.6 million in restricted cash as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The sources and uses of cash reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 

Nine months ended September 30,

(17,876,000) 

Financing activities 

(2,219,000) 

(28,797,000) 

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash from operating activities was 33.0 million and 30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased 2.1 million, or 6.8 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the results for the acquisition of one property on May 30, 2024 and 15 properties on August 31, 2023. This increase was offset by an increase in cash paid for interest of 1.5 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities were primarily the result of the advances and repayments on the RLSCA, a property acquisition, and leasehold improvements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had 19.8 million in net advances under the RSLCA, acquired a property for a total cash outlay of 10.2 million, and incurred expenditures of 0.6 million for improvements of real estate. These cash outflows were offset by 0.1 million in proceeds received from the sale of real estate as a result of a condemnation settlement at one property. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had 7.5 million in net repayments under the RSLCA, acquired 16 properties for a total cash outlay of 24.6 million, and incurred expenditures of 0.7 million for improvements of real estate. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had balloon mortgage loan repayments of 28.8 million, redemptions of 17.5 million of Class A and Class I Common Shares, distributions of 18.0 million to the holders of Class I, Class A, and Class ER Common Shares, distributions of 10.0 million to the holders of OP Units, and financing costs of 1.2 million relating to revolving line of credit entered into in May 2024, which was offset by net borrowings of 44.0 million 
 32 

from its revolving credit facilities, net proceeds of 27.6 million from the issuance of Class I Common Shares, Class A Common Shares, and Class ER Common Shares and pending trade deposits of 1.7 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had net repayments of 73.3 million from its revolving credit facilities, distributions of 19.6 million to the holders of Class A and Class I Common Shares, distributions of 9.8 million to the holders of OP Units, mortgage loans payable repayments of 14.3 million, redemptions of 8.4 million of Class A and Class I Common Shares and financing costs of 0.8 million relating to the two mortgage loans payable entered into in February 2023, which was offset by proceeds of 65.4 million relating to two mortgage loans payable entered into in February 2023, proceeds of 31.1 million from the issuance of Class A and Class I Common Shares and pending trade deposits of 1.2 million. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 The amount of distributions payable to the Company s shareholders is determined by the Trustee and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, the Company s financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain its status as a REIT. Our distribution policy is for our inception-to-date cash flow from operations to always exceed our distributions that have been declared or paid, rather than making distributions out of investor equity or financing, subject only to REIT qualification requirements or to avoid incurring federal income tax. The Trustee has authorized, and the Company has declared, distributions through September 30, 2024. The distributions are payable on approximately the 15th day following each month end to shareholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the prior month. Distributions in the aggregate amount of 3.5 million were declared but not yet paid as of September 30, 2024. The unpaid distributions as of September 30, 2024 were paid in cash or settled in common shares under the Company s Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Share Purchase Plan DRIP during October 2024. 
 
 The following table provides a summary of the monthly distributions declared and paid per Class A Common Share, Class I Common Share, and Class ER Common Share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

Related and Affiliated Party Transactions and Agreements 
 
 The Company has entered into agreements with ExchangeRight and its affiliates whereby we have paid, and may continue to pay, certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, ExchangeRight or its affiliates for acquisition fees and actual incurred out-of-pocket expenses, but specifically excluding reimbursement related to employee compensation. The Company is also subject to a fee arrangement with ExchangeRight and its affiliates for organization and offering costs and asset and property management fees. 
 
 ExchangeRight incurs certain organization and offering costs in connection with the Company s current private securities offering of its common shares and the organization of the Company. These costs include, but are not limited to, fees related to special purpose entity formation, legal and accounting fees, valuation fees related to any expansion of the offering, marketing expenses and other costs and expenses directly related to the offering and organization of the Company. All of these expenses are paid by ExchangeRight or its affiliates. ExchangeRight earns a percentage of the gross proceeds from the offering which is expected to offset the organizational and offering costs incurred described above. This amount is equal to 1.00 of the net transaction price of sales of common shares. Offering costs of 0.1 million and 0.3 million were included in total equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for which the Company was obligated to reimburse ExchangeRight. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 34 

Other than the items disclosed in the Contractual Obligations section above, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company s most critical accounting policies are summarized below. Other accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2024. There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 
 The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries and any single member limited liability companies or other entities which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company consolidates variable interest entities VIEs when it is the primary beneficiary. Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (1) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk (a) lack the power through voting or similar rights to make decisions about the entity s activities that significantly impact the entity s performance, (b) have no obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (c) have no right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately fewer voting rights. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current values, performance of real estate held by these VIEs, and general market conditions. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the useful lives of real estate assets, lease accounting, real estate impairment assessments and allocation of fair value of purchase consideration. These estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes revisions to these estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Investment in Real Estate 
 
 Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Assets are recognized at fair value at acquisition date. 
 
 The Company evaluates each acquisition transaction to determine whether the acquired asset meets the definition of a business and therefore accounted for as a business combination or if the acquisition transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition. Under Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ASU 2017-01 ), an acquisition does not qualify as a business when substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets or the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. Transaction costs related to acquisitions that qualify as asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost basis of the acquired assets, while transaction costs for acquisitions that are deemed to be acquisitions of a business are expensed as incurred. 
 
 The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties accounted for as asset acquisitions to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their relative fair values. Tangible assets may include land, buildings, site improvements and tenant improvements. Intangible assets include the value of in-place leases and above-market leases and 
 35 

intangible liabilities include below-market leases. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the relative fair value of the tangible assets. The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions as well as costs to execute similar leases based on the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. The Company estimates the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in-place leases, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. 
 
 The values of acquired above-market and below-market leases are recorded based on the present values (using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of the acquisitions. Such valuations include consideration of the noncancelable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values associated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company s experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The values of the above-market and below-market leases are amortized over the term of the respective leases, including certain renewal options (as applicable), as an adjustment to rental revenue on the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The value of other intangible assets (including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, etc.) is amortized to expense over the applicable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources and also considers information and other factors including market conditions, the industry that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate; e.g., location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates; tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business. Additionally, the Company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. The Company s methodology for measuring and allocating the fair value of real estate acquisitions includes both observable market data (categorized as level 2 on the three-level valuation hierarchy of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement), and unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own internal assumptions (categorized as level 3 under ASC Topic 820). Given the significance of the unobservable inputs the Company believes the allocations of fair value of real estate acquisitions should be categorized as level 3 under ASC Topic 820. 
 
 Management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable. The review of recoverability of real estate investments held for use is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition. These cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, capital expenditures, competition and other factors. If an impairment event exists due to the projected inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company considers the period of future benefit of each respective asset to determine its appropriate useful life. The estimated useful lives of the Company s real estate assets by class are generally as follows: 

Description 
 
 Depreciable life 

Buildings 
 
 39 years 

Building and site improvements 
 
 Ranging from 5 to 20 years 

Tenant improvements 
 
 Shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life 

Intangible lease assets and liabilities 
 
 Term of the related lease 

Expenditures for improvements that substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and betterments that do not substantially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Revenue Recognition and Receivables 
 
 Management has determined that predominantly all of the Company s leases with its various tenants are operating leases. The Company recognizes minimum rent, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases when collectability is reasonably assured and records amounts expected to be received in later years as deferred rent receivable. Deferred rent receivable represents rent earned in 
 36 

excess of rent received as a result of straight-lining rents over the terms of the leases, in accordance with the guidance and is included in receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred rent liability represents rent received in excess of rent earned as a result of straight-lining rents over the terms of the leases. The Company records property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred. 
 
 A limited number of operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay, as additional rent, a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount. The Company defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified sales targets are met. Revenues also may include items such as lease termination fees, which tend to fluctuate more than rents from year to year. Termination fees are fees that the Company has agreed to accept in consideration for permitting certain tenants to terminate their lease prior to the contractual expiration. The Company recognizes lease termination income when the following conditions are met: (1) the lease termination agreement has been executed, (2) the lease termination fee is determinable, (3) all the Company s landlord services pursuant to the terminated lease have been rendered, and (4) collectability of the lease termination fee is assured. 
 
 If the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or by the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is typically not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. 
 
 When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to: 
 
 whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; 

whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates; 

whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; 

whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and 

whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease. 

Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 The Company presents noncontrolling interests, which represents OP Units, and classifies such interests as a component of equity, separate from the Company s shareholders equity. Noncontrolling interests were created as part of contribution and merger agreements with former 1031-exchangeable portfolios that were previously managed by ExchangeRight on behalf of investors and recognized at fair value as of the date of the transaction. The holders of OP Units have the right to exchange their OP Units for the same number of the Company s Class I Common Shares. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company has elected and is qualified to be taxed as a REIT, as it complies with the related provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, the Company generally is not and will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset, income and share ownership tests are met. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must annually distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders and meet certain other requirements. Under certain circumstances, federal income and excise taxes may be due on its undistributed taxable income. The Company may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes. If the Company fails to meet these requirements, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distributions to its shareholders. Application of tax laws and regulations to various types of transactions is susceptible to varying interpretations. Therefore, amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements could be changed at a later date upon examination and final determination by the taxing authorities. No such examinations by taxing authorities are presently in process. 
 
 The Company provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from the Company s estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 37 

Inflation 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment continued, driven by concerns over geopolitical conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the aggregate effects of inflation generated over the last three years, continued elevated interest rate levels, and uneven economic growth. While overall inflation rates have moderated on a year-over-year basis during 2024, the aggregate effects of the elevated inflation levels experienced from 2021 to 2023 compared to historical norms in many major economies around the world has continued to create economic pressures in the U.S. and many other nations. While the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, there remains uncertainty as to what extent the Federal Reserve and other central banks will continue to ease monetary policy over the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, if at all. Any resurgence of inflation levels could prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to pause, and potentially reverse, their monetary easing policies. 
 
 Substantially all of the Company s tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes or insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. The Company has not been materially impacted in the current period by elevated interest rate levels as all of its mortgage debt is currently effectively fixed-rate financing as of September 30, 2024. Further inflation rate increases or elevated interest rates over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent events and any future changes in interest rates or inflation. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 FFO and Adjusted FFO 
 
 FFO is a widely recognized supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the financial performance of a REIT. The Company presents FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). NAREIT generally defines FFO as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of real estate properties, impairment write-downs on real estate properties directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for partnerships and joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company considers FFO to be an appropriate measure of its financial performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other depreciable assets. 
 
 The Company also considers Adjusted Funds From Operations Adjusted FFO to be an additional meaningful financial measure of financial performance as it provides supplemental information concerning our operating performance, exclusive of certain non-cash items and other costs. The Company believes Adjusted FFO further assists in comparing the Company s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding such items. 
 
 FFO and Adjusted FFO should be reviewed with net (loss) attributable to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, when trying to understand the Company s operating performance. FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders or to cash flow from operating activities. The Company s computations of FFO and Adjusted FFO may differ from the computations utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such REITs.

Net Asset Value 
 
 The Company calculates NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines that have been approved by our Trustee. Our Trustee has adopted valuation procedures, as amended from time to time, that contain a comprehensive set of methodologies to be used in connection with the calculation of our NAV. To calculate our NAV for the purpose of establishing a purchase and redemption price for our shares, our Trustee has adopted a model which adjusts the value of certain of our investments in real estate assets from historical cost to fair value. Our Trustee oversees the process of determining our estimated NAV per share, which includes considering estimated values of our commercial real estate assets and investments, including related liabilities, based upon, in certain instances, reports of the discounted cash flows generated by the underlying real estate provided by an independent valuation firm. The Trustee, upon its receipt and review of such valuation report, will determine a reasonable range for our estimated NAV per share and an estimated NAV per share. The independent valuation firm is not responsible for, and does not prepare, our NAV per share. The final determination of our NAV per share is made by our Trustee. The estimated NAV per share will represent approximately the mid-point of the range of values reflecting the effect of using different discount rates and terminal capitalization rates in the sensitivity analysis. Such NAV may be declared prior to the finalization, and ultimate issuance, of our quarterly or annual financial statements which may result in an immaterial variance in the declared NAV per share to the final reconciliation of NAV per share after the review and issuance of such financial statements is completed. If any such variance was ever determined to be material, our Trustee would declare a revised NAV per share for the quarter. Our Trustee has used the mid-point of the independent valuation firm s real estate value range in setting the NAV per share since our formation. 
 
 We will cause our real property portfolio to be valued quarterly by an independent valuation firm, which will apply the fair value methodologies detailed within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. An independent valuation firm will review information provided by our Trustee regarding the properties we own as of the end of the quarter including location, building size, tenancy, lease rates, lease term and various other relevant metrics. The independent valuation firm will also research and analyze market data and valuation benchmarks in connection with 
 39 

each quarterly valuation. The independent valuation firm will utilize the income approach (i.e., discounted cash flow) to value and may perform the following actions in connection with its quarterly valuations: 
 
 Hold interviews with the employees of our Trustee regarding historical valuation methodology, expertise of the portfolio, and industry expertise; 

Independently research comparable portfolio transactions and individual property transactions; 

Review third-party market reports; and 

Independently review tenant leases for the subject properties. 

In performing each quarterly valuation, our Trustee will provide the independent valuation firm with certain data, including but not limited to the following: 
 
 Real property listing: a master list of all leased properties including all relevant details of each such property including location, lease terms, and other relevant factors. 

Leases and lease amendments: the lease files provide data such as property type, address, lease terms and rent details for the leased real property. 

Estoppels and move-in notices: the documents utilized to verify commencement of leases for build-to-suit properties. 

Property surveys: the documents that verify the size of each leased premise. 

The Company s total NAV presented in the following tables includes the NAV of our Class A, Class I, Class S, and Class ER Common Shares, as well as the OP Units as of September 30, 2024 and per share/unit is identical for Class A, Class I, Class S, and Class ER Common Shares and OP Units.

NAV

643,114,000 

The Company s investments in real estate are presented under historical cost in our consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of the Company s investments in real estate are not recorded in the Company s GAAP results other than in the event of an impairment or upon a sale. The Company s mortgage loans payable and revolving credit facilities are valued at GAAP carrying value in the Company s NAV calculation for any financings that are anticipated to be held to maturity. In addition, because the Company plans to utilize interest rate hedges to stabilize interest payments (i.e. to fix all-in interest rates through interest rate swaps or to limit interest rate exposure through interest rate caps) on individual loans and intends to hold each interest rate hedge until maturity, each interest rate hedge will be valued at par and thus its market value in accordance with GAAP will be excluded from the calculation of NAV. The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement concurrent with the closing of the 26.9 million mortgage entered into in February 2023. At September 30, 2024, 707,000 is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities relating to the fair value of this interest rate swap agreement, which was not included for the calculation of NAV. 
 
 While the Company believes that the independent valuation firm s assumptions and inputs are reasonable, a change in these assumptions and inputs may significantly impact the fair value of the real estate properties and the Company s estimated NAV per share. For purposes of determining the Company s NAV, the Company s investments in real estate as of (1) September 30, 2024 are recorded at fair value using a weighted average discount rate of 6.55 with a range of 6.45 to 6.65 and weighted average exit capitalization rate of 5.75 with a range of 5.65 to 5.85 and (2) December 31, 2023 are recorded at fair value using a weighted average discount rate of 6.60 with a range of 6.50 to 6.70 and weighted average exit capitalization rate of 5.75 with a range of 5.65 to 5.85 . Assuming all other factors remain unchanged, the tables below present the estimated increase or decrease to the Company s September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 NAV for the changes in the weighted average discount and exit capitalization rate.

 ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 Private Offering of Class I, Class A, Class S and Class ER Common Shares 
 
 On February 28, 2019, we commenced private placement offerings of our Class I and Class A Common Shares, the terms of which have been updated from time to time, including the addition of Class S and Class ER Common Shares to the offering (as so updated, the Private Offering ). Upon the receipt of investment proceeds from the offering of our common shares, we transfer the net investment proceeds to our Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units to be held by the Company. The offerings had an initial aggregate offering amount of 100,000,000, which has since been increased by the Trustee to the current aggregate offering amount of 2.165 billion. The common shares are being sold only for cash. The offering does not have a defined expiration date and will be left open to investors until the Trustee determines to terminate the offering. We also have offered the common shares at various offering prices, as determined by the Trustee, effective at various intervals. From the inception of the Private Offering until July 5, 2023, we offered the common shares in the Private Offering in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Commencing on July 6, 2023, we began conducting the Private Offering under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D and began accepting subscriptions for investments under those terms for purchases closing on or after August 1, 2023. As of that date, subscriptions will be accepted solely from accredited investors, as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, whose accredited investor status has been verified by us. Under Rule 506(c), general solicitation and advertisement of offerings is permitted, however all purchasers in the offering must be accredited investors and the Company must take reasonable steps to verify the accredited investor status of each purchaser, among other requirements. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold common shares in the Private Offering, as set forth in the following table:

We have engaged broker-dealers who are registered with the SEC and members of the FINRA to act as our exclusive placement agents in connection with the Private Offering. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid aggregate selling commissions to these placement agents in connection with the Private Offering of 302,000, allocable among the various classes of our common shares as follows: 4,000 with respect to the Class I Common Shares, 188,000 with respect to the Class A Common Shares, and 110,000 with respect to Class ER Common Shares. 
 
 Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Share Purchase Plan 
 
 On October 19, 2023, the Trustee approved the DRIP, which generally permits shareholders of the Company to elect to have some or all of their cash distributions in respect of the shareholder s common shares to be automatically reinvested in additional common shares. Any cash dividends attributable to the class of common shares owned by participants in the DRIP will be reinvested in common shares on behalf of the participant on the business day such dividend would have been paid to such investor. In addition, holders of the Class I and Class A 721 OP Units in the Operating Partnership and the Class ER Common Shares of the Company may elect to reinvest their cash distributions from the Operating Partnership and Company, as applicable, and make optional cash purchases of our Class I Common Shares. Participants may elect to have their cash dividends or distributions reinvested in additional common shares at a 1 discount to the NAV per common share applicable to the class of shares being purchased on the distribution date. The Company will not pay selling commissions on shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP. In addition, ExchangeRight Real Estate, LLC, the sponsor of the Company, will not charge participants for organizational and offering costs in connection with the DRIP. Shares offered under the DRIP have the same rights as the corresponding class of common shares offered to prospective investors in the Company s Private Offering. The offering of the common shares under the DRIP is being conducted in reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D, Rule 506(b), thereunder.

Issuance of Common Shares to OP Unitholders 
 
 The holders of the Operating Partnership s Class I, Class ER and Class A 721 Common Units have the right to cause their units to be redeemed by the Operating Partnership for cash, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to purchase such units in exchange for Class I, Class ER, or Class A Common Shares of the Company, as applicable and corresponding to the class of OP units being redeemed, issuable on a 1:1 basis, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Company currently intends to elect to pay the redemption price for all OP units tendered for redemption in the form of Common Shares of the Company corresponding to the class of OP units being redeemed. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, holders of 15,134 Class I Common Units elected to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem their Class I Common Units, and the Company elected to purchase those units in exchange for the issuance of 15,134 Class I Common Shares. The Company did not pay any selling commissions in connection with the issuance of those common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 The Company has a share repurchase program to provide eligible shareholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell shares back to the Company, subject to restrictions and applicable law, if such repurchases do not impair the capital or operations of the Company. The Company is structured to provide partial liquidity to investors through redemptions on a quarterly basis of up to 5 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares per fiscal year pursuant to the share repurchase program. Affiliates may seek to have their shares repurchased on the same terms and limitations as the common shareholders. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, ExchangeRight s 15.0 million investment in Class I Common Shares is not eligible for redemption pursuant to the share repurchase program. All shareholder requests to the Company for repurchases have been 
 43 

honored since the inception of the Company. The Class ER Common Shares are not eligible for repurchase under the share repurchase program.
