 Senior Secured Credit Facility In March 2024, the Company amended its senior secured credit facility (the "facility") with a -basis point reduction in the term loan B ("term loan") interest rate. As a result, borrowings under the million term loan bear interest, at the Company's election, at (i) the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus percent, or (ii) the bank s base rate plus percent. Related to the debt amendment there were million of costs. The Company accounted for the debt amendment as a modification and, accordingly, these costs were expensed as incurred. There was an insignificant amount of previously capitalized costs that were written off. Borrowings under the million revolving credit facility (the "revolver") bear interest, at the Company's election, at (i) SOFR plus a basis points adjustment plus to percent, or (ii) the bank s base rate plus to percent, depending on leverage levels. A commitment fee of to percent is payable on the undrawn portion of the revolver. The facility is subject to various restrictive covenants including, when amounts are drawn under the revolver, a maximum ratio of senior secured debt to trailing-twelve-months of lender-defined consolidated EBITDA of to 1, which was to 1 at September 30, 2024. The facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and at September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.

OVERVIEW 
 
 ASGN provides information technology ("IT") services and solutions across the commercial and government sectors. ASGN operates through two segments, Commercial and Federal Government. The Commercial Segment, which is the largest segment, provides consulting, creative digital marketing, and permanent placement services primarily to Fortune 1000 and large mid-market companies. The Federal Government Segment provides advanced IT solutions to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and federal civilian agencies. Virtually all of the Company's revenues are generated in the United States. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the quarter were 1.0 billion, down 7.7 percent year-over-year. The table below shows our revenues by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions). 
 of Total 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Commercial Assignment 433.8 508.2 (14.6 42.1 45.5 (3.4 Consulting 285.0 274.2 3.9 27.6 24.6 3.0 718.8 782.4 (8.1 69.7 70.1 (0.4 Federal Government 312.2 334.4 (6.6 30.3 29.9 0.4 Consolidated 1,031.0 1,116.8 (7.7 100.0 100.0 
 
 From an industry perspective, the Company operates in six broad industry verticals. Commercial Segment revenues (69.7 percent of total revenues) were down 8.1 percent year-over-year and are categorized in five verticals: (i) Financial Services, (ii) Consumer and Industrial, (iii) Technology, Media, and Telecom ("TMT"), (iv) Healthcare, and (v) Business Services. The TMT industry vertical had double-digit growth, while Consumer and Industrial was up low single digits year-over-year. The remaining three industry verticals declined year-over-year. Federal Government Segment revenues (30.3 percent of total revenues), the sixth industry vertical, were down 6.6 percent year-over-year, reflecting lower third-party software licenses revenues compared with the prior year. 
 
 Total IT consulting revenues were 597.2 million (57.9 percent of total revenues), down 1.9 percent year-over-year. Commercial Segment consulting revenues were 285.0 million, up 3.9 percent year-over-year. Federal Government Segment revenues, which are all consulting revenues, were 312.2 million, down 6.6 percent year-over-year as stated above. Assignment revenues, which totaled 433.8 million (42.1 percent of total revenues), were down 14.6 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued softness in the portions of the Commercial Segment business that are more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic cycles (i.e., more cyclical). 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 The table below shows gross profit and gross margin by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions). 
 
 Gross Profit Gross Margin 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Commercial 235.8 254.2 (7.2 32.8 32.5 0.3 Federal Government 64.6 68.2 (5.3 20.7 20.4 0.3 Consolidated 300.4 322.4 (6.8 29.1 28.9 0.2 

11 

Gross profit is comprised of revenues less costs of services, which consist primarily of compensation for our contract professionals, other direct costs, and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
 Consolidated gross profit declined 6.8 percent year-over-year on a revenue decline of 7.7 percent. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 29.1 percent, an expansion of 20 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin for the Commercial Segment was up 30 basis points, reflecting a higher mix of consulting revenues as well as margin expansion in these revenues. Gross margin for the Federal Government Segment was up 30 basis points due to lower third-party software licenses revenues, which carry lower margins. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our field operations and corporate staff, information systems, rent, public company expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. SG A expenses were 207.5 million, compared with 206.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The higher SG A expenses reflected higher legal settlement expenses and depreciation and amortization of capitalized cloud implementation costs. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets was 14.0 million, compared with 17.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to the accelerated amortization method of certain acquired intangibles, which have high amortization rates at the beginning of their useful lives. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net, which consists primarily of cash-based interest expense, amortization and adjustments to deferred loan costs, and interest income, was 16.0 million, down from 18.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease is attributable to 2.3 million of costs in the prior year period that related to the August 2023 amendments to the senior secured credit facility. The weighted-average outstanding borrowings and cash-based interest rate in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 1.0 billion and 6.0 percent for both periods. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 15.4 million, down from 20.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to lower income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24.5 percent, down from 25.8 percent in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income was 47.5 million, down from 59.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED WITH THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the first nine months of the year were 3.1 billion, down 7.8 percent year-over-year. The table below shows our revenues by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions).

 Commercial Segment revenues (69.9 percent of total revenues) were down 10.3 percent year-over-year. The TMT industry vertical had low single-digit growth. The remaining four industry verticals declined year-over-year. Federal Government Segment revenues (30.1 percent of total revenues), the sixth industry vertical, were down 1.3 percent year-over-year. 
 
 Total IT consulting services revenues were 1.8 billion (57.2 percent of total revenues), up 0.3 percent year-over-year. Commercial Segment consulting revenues were 843.5 million, up 2.0 percent year-over-year. Federal Government Segment revenues, which are all consulting revenues, were 938.7 million, down 1.3 percent year-over-year as stated above. Assignment revenues, which totaled 1.3 billion (42.8 percent of total revenues), were down 16.7 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued softness in the more cyclical portions of the Commercial Segment business.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 The table below shows gross profit and gross margin by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions). 
 
 Gross Profit Gross Margin 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Commercial 706.9 777.5 (9.1 32.5 32.1 0.4 Federal Government 190.8 197.6 (3.4 20.3 20.8 (0.5 Consolidated 897.7 975.1 (7.9 28.8 28.9 (0.1 

Consolidated gross profit declined 7.9 percent year-over-year on a revenue decline of 7.8 percent. Gross margin was 28.8 percent, a compression of 10 basis points from the first nine months of 2023. The compression mainly related to business mix, including a higher mix of revenues from the Federal Government Segment, which have a lower gross margin than Commercial Segment revenues. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 
 SG A expenses were 623.3 million, down from 640.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily related to lower compensation-related expenses. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets was 44.2 million, compared with 53.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was due to the accelerated amortization method of certain acquired intangibles, which have high amortization rates at the beginning of their useful lives. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net was 49.4 million, down from 49.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of higher interest income and lower debt amendment fees (related to refinancing the senior secured credit facility in both periods), partially offset by higher interest expense on the senior secured credit facility. The weighted-average outstanding borrowings for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 1.05 billion and the cash-based interest rate was 6.1 percent and 5.8 percent (excluding costs related to debt amendments), respectively. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 48.0 million, down from 62.0 million in the first nine months of 2023 due to lower income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 26.5 percent, down from 26.8 percent in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income was 132.8 million, down from 169.0 million in the first nine months of 2023.

Commercial Segment - Consulting Metrics 
 
 Commercial consulting bookings are the value of new contracts entered into during a specified period, including adjustments for the effects of changes in contract scope and contract terminations ("Bookings"). The underlying contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties. Measuring Bookings involves the use of estimates and judgments and there are no independent standards or requirements governing the calculation of Bookings. Information regarding Bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of reported revenues. The book-to-bill ratio for our commercial consulting revenues is the ratio of Bookings to commercial consulting revenues for a specified period. The average duration of commercial consulting projects is one year.

Federal Government Segment Metrics 
 
 Contract backlog for our Federal Government Segment represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under awarded contracts, including task orders and options, at a point in time ("Contract Backlog"). These estimates are subject to change and may be affected by the execution of new contracts, the extension or early termination of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts. The timing of the execution of new contracts and other changes are affected by the funding cycles of the government and can vary from quarter to quarter. New contract awards are the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under contracts awarded during a specified period, including adjustments to estimates for contracts awarded in previous periods New Contract Awards ). Information regarding New Contract Awards is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of reported revenues. Due to variability, New Contract Awards are presented on a trailing-twelve-months TTM basis. The book-to-bill ratio for our Federal Government Segment is the ratio of New Contract Awards to revenues for a specified period. Contract Backlog coverage ratio is calculated as total Contract Backlog divided by TTM revenues.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our working capital, which is current assets less current liabilities, at September 30, 2024 was 503.7 million, and our cash and cash equivalents were 166.6 million. Our cash flows from operating activities have been our primary source of liquidity and have been sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. At September 30, 2024, we had full availability under the 500.0 million revolving credit facility. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, expected operating cash flows, and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fulfill our obligations, working capital requirements, and capital expenditures for the next 12 months. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 299.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 340.5 million in the same period of 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was 245.0 million, compared with 286.6 million in the same period of 2023. Net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was 54.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 53.9 million in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 24.0 million and 33.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and primarily related to capital expenditures. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 283.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 and included 283.3 million to repurchase the Company's common stock. Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of the prior year was 231.6 million and included 197.7 million to repurchase the Company's common stock, net repayments of borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaling 31.5 million, and the effects of the August 2023 amendments to the Company's senior secured credit facility which generated net proceeds of 8.0 million that were offset by related amendment costs. 
 
 For details on the Company s senior secured credit facility, comprised of a revolving credit facility and term loan B, and unsecured senior notes, see Note 3. Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 There have been no recent accounting pronouncements that significantly impact the Company. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the third quarter of 2024 compared with those disclosed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 10-K . 

Commitments 
 
 There were no material changes to the significant commitments or contractual obligations that were disclosed in our 2023 10-K. 

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 
 With respect to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rates risks, there have been no material changes to the information included in our 2023 10-K. Our exposure to interest rate risk is associated with our debt instruments. See Note 3. Long-Term Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a further description of our debt instruments. A hypothetical 100 basis-point change in interest rates on variable-rate debt would have resulted in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately 5.0 million based on 495.0 million of debt outstanding for any 12-month period. We have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 

Item 4 Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. "Disclosure controls and procedures" include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
