 For available for sale securities, the Company assesses whether a loss is from credit or other factors and considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and adverse conditions related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows is less than the amortized cost, a credit loss would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. 
 
 There was activity in the allowance for credit losses on debt securities available for sale for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Purchased credit-deteriorated ("PCD") loans were loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality. These loans were initially recorded at fair value at acquisition, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, with no related allowance for credit losses. Loans acquired in a business combination are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 326, which requires loans as of the acquisition date, that have experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, to be classified as PCD loans. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PCD loans acquired in the Stewardship Financial Corporation ("Stewardship") acquisition totaled million and million, respectively, PCD loans acquired in the Freehold Bank acquisition totaled and million, respectively, and PCD loans acquired in the RSI Bank acquisition totaled million and million, respectively.

At December 31, 2023, the Company had real estate owned. At September 30, 2024 we had residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of million collateralized by residential real estate, which were in the process of foreclosure.

 The determination of the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans is considered a critical accounting estimate by management because of the high degree of judgment involved in determining qualitative loss factors, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment. The ACL is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for estimated losses and impairment based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risk in the loan portfolio. The ACL consists of two elements: (1) identification of loans that must be individually analyzed for impairment and (2) establishment of an ACL for loans collectively analyzed. 
 
 Portfolio segments are defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit losses. Management developed segments for estimating losses based on the type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal call report segmentation. The segments have been combined or sub-segments have been added as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled. 
 
 We maintain a loan review system that provides a periodic review of the loan portfolio and the identification of individually analyzed loans. The ACL for individually analyzed loans is based on the fair value of collateral or cash flows. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. 
 
 The ACL quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using a discounted cash flow methodology incorporating an econometric, probability of default PD and loss given default LGD with distinct segment-specific multi-variate regression models applied. Expected credit losses are estimated over the life of the loans by measuring the difference between the net present value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. Contractual cash flows over the contractual life of the loans are the basis for the modeled cash flows, adjusted for model defaults and expected prepayments and discounted at the loan-level effective interest rate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications.

 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) , Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures , which eliminated the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings TDRs while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. This guidance was applied on a prospective basis. Modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may include principal or interest forgiveness, forbearance, interest rate reductions, term extensions, or a combination of these events intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral.

 Management prepares an analysis each quarter that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial business, etc.) and loan risk rating. The categorization of loans into risk categories is based upon relevant information about the borrower's ability to service their debt. 
 The Company utilizes a risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar risk characteristics. Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating established for loans with minimal risk. Loans rated 4w are watch loans, which may have a potential concern that warrants increased oversight and tracking by management. We enhanced our level of scrutiny and focus regarding documentation related to credit risk rating benchmark guidelines that pertain to debt-service coverage ratios, LTV ratios, borrower strength, asset quality, and funded cash reserves. Other factors such as guarantees, market strength, and remaining loan term and borrower equity are also reviewed and are factored into determining the credit risk rating assigned to each loan. Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (Special Mention) or 6 (Substandard). Loans with adverse classifications are rated 7 (Doubtful) or 8 (Loss). The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations which are currently performed by both an independent third-party and the Company's credit risk review department. The Company requires an annual review be performed above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings. Results from examinations are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Total assets increased 40.9 million, or 0.4 , to 10.7 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to an increase in debt securities available for sale of 178.9 million, and an increase in other assets of 21.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 139.7 million, and a decrease in loans receivable, net, of 20.7 million. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 139.7 million, or 33.0 , to 283.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 423.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to purchases of securities of 283.5 million and repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program of 5.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from principal repayments on securities of 119.3 million, and repayments on loans receivable. 
 
 Debt securities available for sale increased 178.9 million, or 16.4 , to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable to the purchases of debt securities available for sale of 266.9 million, consisting primarily of U.S. government obligations and mortgage-backed securities, and a decrease in gross unrealized losses on securities of 34.3 million, partially offset by repayments on securities of 107.8 million, maturities of securities of 10.0 million, and the sale of one corporate debt security with a carrying value of 4.8 million, resulting in a loss of 1.3 million. 
 
 Loans receivable, net, decreased 20.7 million, or 0.3 , with a balance of 7.8 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. One-to-four family real estate loans, multifamily loans, commercial real estate loans, and home equity loans and advances decreased 55.6 million, 10.2 million, 64.3 million, and 5.6 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in construction loans of 67.3 million and commercial business loans of 53.4 million. The allowance for credit losses for loans increased 3.4 million to 58.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 55.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Other assets increased 21.3 million or 6.9 , to 329.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 308.4 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a 10.4 million increase in the Company's pension plan balance, as the return on plan assets outpaced the growth in the plan's obligations and a 12.6 million increase in the Company's collateral posting with certain of its derivative counterparties. 
 
 Total liabilities increased 2.1 million, or 0.02 , totaling 9.6 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in total deposits of 111.5 million, or 1.4 , partially offset by a decrease in borrowings of 108.1 million, or 7.1 . The increase in total deposits primarily consisted of an increase in certificates of deposit and interest-bearing demand deposits of 195.7 million, and 13.8 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings and club accounts of 31.2 million, 16.3 million, and 50.5 million, respectively. The Bank has priced select certificates of deposit accounts very competitively to the market to attract new customers.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The 108.1 million decrease in borrowings was primarily driven by a net decrease in short-term borrowings of 167.8 million and repayments of 175.5 million in maturing long-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in long-term borrowings of 235.2 million. 
 
 Total stockholders equity increased 38.8 million, or 3.7 , to 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total stockholders' equity was primarily attributable to net income of 9.6 million, a 5.5 million increase in stock based compensation and an increase of 27.7 million in other comprehensive income, which includes changes in unrealized losses on debt securities available for sale and unrealized gains on swap contracts, net of taxes, included in other comprehensive income. These increases were partially offset by the repurchase of 365,116 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately 5.9 million, or 16.14 per share, under our stock repurchase program. Repurchases have been paused in order to retain capital. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income of 6.2 million was recorded for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 32.3 , compared to 9.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a 3.2 million decrease in net interest income, and a 1.7 million increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 376,000 increase in non-interest income, and a 1.6 million decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Net interest income was 45.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.2 million, or 6.7 , from 48.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to a 20.7 million increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by a 17.5 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in average yields due to market interest rate increases that occurred throughout 2023, and adjustable rate securities and loans tied to various indexes that repriced higher in the 2024 period. The 50 basis point decrease in market rates in September 2024 did not significantly impact the 2024 period results. The increase in interest expense on deposits was driven by the 2023 rate increases and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, coupled with the continued intense competition for deposits in the market and the repricing of existing deposits into higher cost products. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was also impacted by an increase in the average balance of borrowings and the increase in interest rates for new borrowings. Prepayment penalties, which are included in interest income on loans, totaled 171,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 83,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The average yield on loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 53 basis points to 5.00 , as compared to 4.47 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as interest income was influenced by rising interest rates and the average balance of loans. The average yield on securities for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 53 basis points to 2.90 , as compared to 2.37 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as new securities purchased during the 2024 period were at higher rates. The average yield on other interest-earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 81 basis points to 6.72 , as compared to 5.91 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to the rise in average balances and interest rates paid on cash balances and an increase in the dividend rate paid on Federal Home Loan Bank stock. 
 
 Total interest expense was 70.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 20.7 million, or 41.6 , from 49.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a 90 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, coupled with an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, along with a 17 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings, coupled with an increase in the average balance of borrowings. Interest expense on deposits increased 16.3 million, or 45.3 , and interest expense on borrowings increased 4.5 million, or 31.9 . 
 
 The Company's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 22 basis points to 1.84 , when compared to 2.06 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets increased 53 basis points to 4.70 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.17 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 82 basis points to 3.52 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.70 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in yields for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was due to the impact of market interest rate increases in 2023. The net interest margin decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities outweighed the increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The Company's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 increased 9 basis points from 1.75 to 1.84 .

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 4.1 million, an increase of 1.7 million, from 2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in provision for credit losses during the quarter was primarily attributable to net charge-offs totaling 2.7 million and an increase in the loan performance qualitative factors. 
 
 Non-interest income was 9.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 376,000, from 8.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 347,000 in demand deposit account fees, mainly related to commercial account treasury services. 
 
 Non-interest expense was 42.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 76,000, from 42.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense of 1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in data processing fees of 666,000, and federal deposit insurance premiums of 317,000. The decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense was the result of workforce reduction and lower incentive compensation related to employee cost cutting strategies implemented during 2023 and 2024. Data processing and software expenses increased due to costs related to cybersecurity and technology enhancements, and federal deposit insurance premiums increased due to the 2024 quarter including an increase in a one-time special assessment charge. 
 
 Income tax expense was 1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.6 million, as compared to income tax expense of 2.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in pre-tax income. The Company's effective tax rate was 15.5 and 22.9 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the 2024 quarter was primarily impacted by permanent income tax differences.

 Net interest income was 131.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 29.0 million, or 18.1 , from 160.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to a 79.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by a 50.4 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in average yields due to market interest rate increases that occurred throughout 2023, and adjustable rate securities and loans tied to various indexes that repriced higher in the 2024 period. The 50 basis point decrease in market rates in September 2024 did not significantly impact the 2024 period results. The increase in interest expense on deposits was driven by the 2023 rate increases and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, coupled with the continued intense competition for deposits in the market and the repricing of existing deposits into higher cost products.

 The average yield on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 55 basis points to 4.91 , as compared to 4.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as interest income was influenced by higher interest rates and loan growth. The average yield on securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 40 basis points to 2.82 , as compared to 2.42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a number of adjustable rate securities tied to various indexes repriced higher during the nine months, and new securities purchased during the 2024 period were at higher yields. The average yield on other interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 90 basis points to 6.35 , as compared to 5.45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the rise in average balances and interest rates paid on cash balances and an increase in the dividend rate paid on Federal Home Loan Bank stock. 
 
 Total interest expense was 206.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 79.4 million, 62.5 , from 126.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The net interest margin decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities outweighed the increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. 
 
 The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.6 million, an increase of 7.9 million, from 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in provision for credit losses was primarily attributable to net charge-offs totaling 8.2 million and an increase in the loan performance qualitative factors. 
 
 Non-interest income was 25.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.5 million, from 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in the loss on securities transactions of 9.6 million.

The decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense was the result of workforce reduction and lower incentive compensation related to employee cost cutting strategies implemented during 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Income tax expense was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7.8 million, as compared to income tax expense of 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in pre-tax income. The Company's effective tax rate was 11.8 and 23.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the 2024 period was also impacted by permanent income tax differences.

 The Company's non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 totaled 28.0 million, or 0.36 of total gross loans, as compared to 12.6 million, or 0.16 of total gross loans, at December 31, 2023.

One borrower with an outstanding 5.7 million commercial real estate loan and a related 3.5 million commercial business loan was placed on non-accrual status, representing approximately 60 of the increase in non-performing loans during the 2024 period. This borrower is a healthcare facility that was acquired by another healthcare provider in 2024.

 The increase in non-performing one-to-four family real estate loans was due to an increase in the number of loans from 17 non-performing loans at December 31, 2023 to 27 loans at September 30, 2024. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets totaled 0.28 and 0.12 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income. These policies require management to make significant judgments and assumptions on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty. The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions, estimates and judgements applied, could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations. These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment. The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies: 
 
 Adequacy of the allowance for credit losses

 The determination of the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans is considered a critical accounting estimate by management because of the high degree of judgment involved in determining qualitative loss factors, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment The ACL is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for estimated losses and impairment based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risk in the loan portfolio. The ACL consists of two elements: (1) identification of loans that must be individually analyzed for impairment and (2) establishment of an ACL for loans collectively analyzed. 
 
 Management estimates the ACL using relevant and reliable information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast. Historical credit loss experience for both the Company and its segment-specific peers provides the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Credit losses over a defined period are converted to PD rate curves through the use of segment-specific LGD risk factors that convert default rates to loss severity based on industry-level, observed relationships between the two variables for each segment, primarily due to the nature of the underlying collateral. These risk factors were assessed for reasonableness against the Company s own loss experience and adjusted in certain cases when the relationship between the Company s historical default and loss severity deviate from that of the wider industry. The historical PD

 curves, together with corresponding economic conditions, establish a quantitative relationship between economic conditions and loan performance through an economic cycle. 
 
 Portfolio segments are defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit losses. Management developed segments for estimating losses based on the type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal call report segmentation. The segments have been combined or sub-segments have been added as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled. 
 
 We maintain a loan review system that provides a periodic review of the loan portfolio and the identification of individually analyzed loans. The ACL for individually analyzed loans is based on the fair value of collateral or cash flows. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. 
 
 The ACL quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using a discounted cash flow methodology incorporating an econometric, probability of default PD and loss given default LGD with distinct segment-specific multi-variate regression models applied. Expected credit losses are estimated over the life of the loans by measuring the difference between the net present value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. Contractual cash flows over the contractual life of the loans are the basis for the modeled cash flows, adjusted for model defaults and expected prepayments and discounted at the loan-level effective interest rate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications. 
 
 Management estimates the ACL using relevant and reliable information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast. Historical credit loss experience for both the Company and its segment-specific peers provides the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Credit losses over a defined period are converted to PD rate curves through the use of segment-specific LGD risk factors that convert default rates to loss severity based on industry-level, observed relationships between the two variables for each segment, primarily due to the nature of the underlying collateral. These risk factors were assessed for reasonableness against the Company s own loss experience and adjusted in certain cases when the relationship between the Company s historical default and loss severity deviate from that of the wider industry. The historical PD curves, together with corresponding economic conditions, establish a quantitative relationship between economic conditions and loan performance through an economic cycle. 
 
 Using the historical relationship between economic conditions and loan performance, management s expectation of future loan performance is incorporated using a single economic forecast of macroeconomic variables (i.e., unemployment, gross domestic product, vacancy, and home price index). This forecast is applied over a period that management has determined to be reasonable and supportable. Beyond the period over which management can develop or source a reasonable and supportable forecast, the model reverts to long-term average historical loss rates using a straight-line, time-based methodology. The Company's current forecast period is six quarters, with a four-quarter reversion period to long-term average historical loss rates. 
 
 After quantitative considerations, management applies additional qualitative adjustments that consider the expected impact of certain factors not fully captured in the quantitative reserve. Qualitative adjustments include but are not limited to concentrations of large loan balances, delinquency trends, change in collateral values within segments, and other considerations. 
 
 The ACL is established through the provision for credit losses that are charged to income, which is based upon an evaluation of estimated losses in the current loan portfolio, including the evaluation of individually analyzed loans. Charge-offs against the ACL are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal and interest is unlikely. Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the ACL. Although we believe we have established and maintained the ACL on loans at appropriate levels, changes in reserves may be necessary if actual economic and other conditions differ substantially from the forecast used in estimating the ACL. 
 
 Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the level of the ACL. This process involves our analysis of internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate ACL. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved, should we experience sizable loan losses in any particular period and/or significant changes in assumptions or economic condition. We believe the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a general decline in the economy, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment, increasing vacancy rates, and increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement or any other such factors. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect a borrower's ability to repay its loan, resulting in increased delinquencies and loan losses. Accordingly, we have recorded loan credit losses at a level which is estimated to represent the current risk in its loan portfolio.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Most of our non-performing assets are collateral dependent loans which are written down to the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. We continue to assess the collateral of these loans and update our appraisals on these loans on at least an annual basis. To the extent the property values decline, there could be additional losses on these non-performing assets, which may be material. Management considered these market conditions in deriving the estimated ACL. Should economic difficulties occur, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from our current estimate. 
 
 The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carry-back years, and projections of future taxable income. These estimates are subject to management s judgment. A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period enacted. Management believes, based on current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize federal deferred tax assets and that it is more likely than not that the benefits from certain state temporary differences will not be realized. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's net deferred tax assets totaled 16.3 million and 25.5 million, respectively, which included a valuation allowance totaling 26,000 at both period end dates. Based upon projections of future taxable income and the ability to carryforward operating losses indefinitely, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the remaining deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits, along with a split dollar BOLI death benefit, to eligible retired employees. The cost of retiree health care and other benefits during the employees' period of active service are accrued monthly. The accounting guidance requires the following: (a) recognize in the statement of financial position the over funded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations; (b) measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the Company's fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the actuarial gain and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period. These assets and liabilities and expenses are based upon actuarial assumptions including interest rates, rates of increase in compensation, expected rate of return on plan assets and the length of time we will have to provide those benefits. Actual results may differ from these assumptions. These assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually, and management believes the estimates are reasonable.

Qualitative Analysis. Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of a Company's current and future earnings and capital arising from movements in market interest rates. The guidelines of the Company s interest rate risk policy seek to limit the exposure to changes in interest rates that affect the underlying economic value of assets, liabilities, earnings and capital. 
 
 The Asset/Liability Committee meets regularly to review the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net interest margin, net income, and the economic value of equity. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income. 
 
 The Company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable funding base by focusing on core deposit accounts. The Company s ability to retain maturing time deposit accounts is the result of its strategy to remain competitively priced within its marketplace. The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon current funding needs and the ability of the Company to fund operations through alternative sources. 
 
 Quantitative Analysis. Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models. The analysis captures changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base and rising and declining interest rate forecasts. Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable changes. The Company periodically reviews historical deposit re-pricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its balance sheet and income simulation models regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits. These modifications are made to more closely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios. Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest-bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted. There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes. 
 
 Assumptions used in the simulation model may include but are not limited to: 
 
 Securities pricing from third parties; 
 Loan pricing indications from third parties; 
 Loan and depository spread assumptions based upon the Company's product offerings; 
 Securities and borrowing spreads based upon third party indications; and 
 Prepayment assumptions derived from the Company's actual results and third party surveys. 
 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in net interest income requires the use of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit repricing, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and repricing rates will approximate actual future asset prepayment and liability repricing activity. 
 
 The table below sets forth an approximation of our interest rate exposure. Net interest income assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual. 
 
 The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the net portfolio value, the estimated changes in the net portfolio value, and the net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel changes in market interest rates. This data is for Columbia Bank and Freehold Bank and its subsidiaries only and does not include any assets of the Company.

 As of September 30, 2024, based on the scenarios above, net interest income would increase by approximately 1.21 if rates were to rise 200 basis points, and would decrease by 1.87 if rates were to decrease 200 basis points over a one-year time horizon. 
 
 Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in net portfolio value through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks. As of September 30, 2024, based on the scenarios above, in the event of an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the NPV is projected to decrease 16.29 . If rates were to decrease 200 basis points, the model forecasts a 11.82 increase in the NPV. 
 
 Overall, our September 30, 2024 results indicate that we are adequately positioned with an acceptable net interest income and economic value at risk in all scenarios and that all interest rate risk results continue to be within our policy guidelines. 
 
 Liquidity Management and Capital Resources: 
 
 Liquidity Management. Liquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities, maturities and sales of securities, and the ability to execute new borrowings. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of debt securities, and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are influenced by economic conditions, competition, and interest rate movements. 
 
 The Company's cash flows are identified as cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details of the cash inflows and outflows of the Company. 
 
 We mitigate liquidity risk by attempting to structure our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail deposits, long-term debt, wholesale borrowings, and capital. We assess liquidity needs arising from asset growth, maturing obligations, and deposit withdrawals, taking into account operations in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events. In addition, we consider our off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. 
 
 Our Asset/Liability Committee measures liquidity risks, sets policies to manage these risks, and reviews adherence to those policies at its quarterly meetings. For example, we manage the use of short-term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by our Asset/Liability Committee. In addition, the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors reviews liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted liquidity positions at each of its regularly scheduled meetings. 
 We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as rapid asset growth or financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds and dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window and through the FHLB system, fed funds purchased from other banks 
 71

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

and the ability to sell, pledge or borrow against unencumbered securities in our securities portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the potential liquidity from these sources is an amount we believe currently exceeds any contingent liquidity need. 
 Capital Resources. The Company and its subsidiary banks (Columbia Bank and Freehold Bank) are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators, including a risk-based capital measure. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") has similar requirements for the Company's subsidiary banks. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 Federal regulators require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: (1) total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 ; (2) tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0 ; (3) common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 ; and (4) tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 4.0 . In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The regulators established a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has: a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.0 , a tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.0 , a common tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6.5 , and a tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets ratio of at least 5.0 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, each of the Company and Columbia Bank and Freehold Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject. 
 
 The following tables presents the Company's, Columbia Bank's and Freehold Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 compared to the Federal Reserve Bank minimum capital adequacy requirements and the Federal Reserve Bank requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution:
