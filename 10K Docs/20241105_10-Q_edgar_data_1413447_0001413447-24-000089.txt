Introduction and Forward Looking Statements 
 This Form 10-Q and certain information incorporated herein by reference contains forward-looking statements, which are provided under the safe harbor protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Form 10-Q, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , forecast , expect , intend , plan and project and similar expressions, as they relate to us, our management or third parties, identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business strategy, financial condition, results of operations, market data as well as any other statements that are not historical facts. These statements reflect beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by our management and information currently available to us. Although we believe that these beliefs and assumptions are reasonable, these statements are subject to numerous factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected. These factors, risks and uncertainties expressly qualify all subsequent oral and written forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf and include, in addition to those listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, the following: 
 market demand and semiconductor industry conditions; 
 our ability to successfully introduce new technologies and products; 
 the demand for the goods into which our products are incorporated; 
 trade disputes between the U.S. and China, potential increase of barriers to international trade and resulting disruptions to our established supply chains; 
 the impact of government actions and regulations, including restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology; 
 increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks, including theft of sensitive or confidential data; 
 our ability to generate sufficient cash, raise sufficient capital or refinance our debt at or before maturity to meet our debt service, research and development and capital investment requirements; 
 our ability to accurately estimate demand and match our production capacity accordingly or obtain supplies from third-party producers; 
 our access to production from third-party outsourcing partners, and any events that might affect their business or our relationship with them; 
 our ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers; 
 our ability to avoid operational problems and product defects and, if such issues were to arise, to correct them quickly; 
 our ability to form strategic partnerships and joint ventures and successfully cooperate with our strategic alliance partners; 
 our ability to win competitive bid selection processes; 
 our ability to develop products for use in our customers equipment and products; 
 our ability to successfully hire and retain key management and senior product engineers;

 our ability to maintain good relationships with our suppliers; and 
 a change in tax laws could have an effect on our estimated effective tax rates. 
 
 We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements and disclaim any obligation to update our view of any risks or uncertainties described herein or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q, except as required by law. 
 
 In addition, this Form 10-Q contains information concerning the semiconductor industry, our end markets and business generally, which is forward-looking in nature and is based on a variety of assumptions regarding the ways in which the semiconductor industry, our end markets and business will develop. We have based these assumptions on information currently available to us, including through the market research and industry reports referred to in this Form 10-Q. If any one or more of these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual market results may differ from those predicted. While we do not know what impact any such differences may have on our business, if there are such differences, they could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak to results only as of the date the statements were made. Except for any ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by the United States federal securities laws, NXP does not have any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after we distribute this document, whether to reflect any future events or circumstances or otherwise.

The financial information included in this Form 10-Q is based on United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), unless otherwise indicated. 
 
 In presenting and discussing our financial position, operating results and cash flows, management uses certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to the equivalent U.S. GAAP measures and should be used in conjunction with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. A discussion of non-U.S. GAAP measures included in this Form 10-Q and a reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are set forth under Use of Certain Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures contained in this Form 10-Q under Item 2.

The effective tax rate of for the third quarter of 2024 was higher than the EAETR due to the income tax expense for discrete items of million. The discrete items are primarily related to changes in estimates for previous years, and the impact of foreign currency on income tax related items. In addition to this, there was a recapture of tax benefit of million due to a higher EAETR compared to prior quarter. 
 
 For the first nine months ended 2024 the effective tax rate of was higher than due to a net result of unfavorable discrete items of million. 
 
 The effective tax rate of for the first nine months of 2024 was higher compared to the rate for the first nine months ended 2023 of due to a different mix of the benefit (provision) for income taxes in our operating locations, lower foreign tax incentives in the current period as a result of a decrease in qualifying income, newly enacted alternative minimum tax law as per 2024, and also due to the impact of the discrete items in the respective periods.

 Money market funds 1 Marketable equity securities 1 Derivative instruments-assets 2 Liabilities: Derivative instruments-liabilities 2 ) ) 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments: 
 
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
 Investments in short-term deposits, representing liquid assets with original maturity beyond three months and having no significant risk of changes in fair value, are represented at carrying value as reasonable estimates of fair value due to the relatively short period of time between the origination of the instruments and their expected realization. Money market funds (as part of our cash and cash equivalents) and marketable equity securities (as part of other non-current assets) have fair value measurements which are all based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For derivatives (as part of other current assets or accrued liabilities) the fair value is based upon significant other observable inputs depending on the nature of the derivative. 
 
 Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis 
 We measure and record our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, at fair value when an impairment charge is required. 
 
 Assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
 Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period and debt. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the estimated fair value of current and non-current debt was billion billion as of December 31, 2023). The fair value is estimated on the basis of broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. Accrued interest is included under accrued liabilities and not within the carrying amount or estimated fair value of debt.

 million, which are due through 2044 . 
 
 Foundry Joint Venture Commitments 
 Driven by our investment in VisionPower Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (VSMC), NXP has initially invested million of equity in the third quarter of 2024 and has committed to invest an additional million in equity through 2026. NXP has committed to contribute an additional million to support the long-term capacity infrastructure that is expected to be paid through 2026. In addition, NXP has an agreed purchase commitment with VSMC that over the lifetime of the factory the minimal loading will be between 80 - 90 , resulting in a total purchase commitment of approximately million that is expected to be purchased over years once wafer production starts. 
 
 Related to our investment in European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH, NXP has committed to invest an additional million in equity through 2028. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We are regularly involved as plaintiffs or defendants in claims and litigation relating to a variety of matters such as contractual disputes, personal injury claims, employee grievances and intellectual property litigation. In addition, our acquisitions, divestments and financial transactions sometimes result in, or are followed by, claims or litigation. Some of these claims may possibly be recovered from insurance reimbursements. Although the ultimate disposition of asserted claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is our belief that the outcome of any such claims, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, such outcomes may be material to our condensed consolidated statement of operations for a particular period. The Company records an accrual for any claim that arises whenever it considers that it is probable that it is exposed to a loss contingency and the amount of the loss contingency can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record a gain contingency until the period in which all contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized or realizable. Legal fees are expensed when incurred. 
 
 Motorola Personal Injury Lawsuits 
 The Company is currently assisting Motorola in the defense of personal injury lawsuits due to indemnity obligations included in the agreement that separated Freescale from Motorola in 2004. The multi-plaintiff Motorola lawsuits are pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. These claims allege a link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room facilities and birth defects in individuals. The Motorola suits allege exposures between 1980 and 2005. Each claim seeks an unspecified amount of damages for the alleged injuries; however, legal counsel representing the plaintiffs has indicated they will seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages from Motorola for the entire inventory of claims which, if proven and recovered, the Company considers to be material. A portion of any indemnity due to Motorola will be reimbursed to NXP if Motorola receives an indemnification payment from its insurance coverage. Motorola has potential insurance coverage for many of the years indicated above, but with differing types and levels of coverage, self-insurance retention amounts and deductibles. We are in discussions with Motorola and their insurers regarding the availability of applicable insurance coverage for each of the individual cases. Motorola and NXP have denied liability for these alleged injuries based on numerous defenses. 
 
 Legal Proceedings Related Accruals and Insurance Coverage 
 The Company reevaluates at least on a quarterly basis the claims that have arisen to determine whether any new accruals need to be made or whether any accruals made need to be adjusted based on the most current information available to it and based on its best estimate. Based on the procedures described above, the Company has an aggregate amount of million accrued for potential and current legal proceedings pending as of September 29, 2024, compared to million accrued at December 31, 2023 (without reduction for any related insurance reimbursements). The accruals are included in Other current liabilities and in Other non-current liabilities . As of September 29, 2024, the Company s related balance of insurance reimbursements was million (December 31, 2023: million) and is included in Other non-current assets . 
 
 The Company also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued based on currently available information for those cases for which such estimate can be made. The estimated aggregate range requires significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants (including the Company) in such claims whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the claims, and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such claims. Accordingly, the Company s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate. As at September 29, 2024, the Company believes that for all litigation pending its potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued (without reduction for any

and million. Based upon our past experience with these matters, the Company would expect to receive additional insurance reimbursement of up to million on certain of these claims that would partially offset the potential aggregate exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued.

 Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 
 Financial income (expense) was an expense of 82 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to an expense of 75 million for the three months ended October 1, 2023. Interest income decreased 13 million as a result of lower cash levels, and interest expense decreased by 13 million primarily due to the retirement of the 4.875 senior unsecured notes on March 1, 2024. Within Other financial income/ (expense), unrecognized tax benefit related interest increased 3 million. Additionally, fair value adjustments in equity securities resulted in a loss of 5 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, versus a loss of 4 million for the three months ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 Financial income (expense) was an expense of 227 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, compared to an expense of 231 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024. Interest income decreased 9 million as a result of 
 23 

lower cash levels, and interest expense decreased by 31 million primarily due to the retirement of the 4.875 senior unsecured notes on March 1, 2024. Within Other financial income/ (expense), unrecognized tax benefit related interest increased 10 million. Additionally, there were fair value adjustments in equity securities, a loss of 10 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, versus a profit of 1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 Benefit (provision) for income taxes 
 Our provision for income taxes for 2024 is based on our EAETR of 17.7 , which is lower than the Netherlands statutory tax rate of 25.8 , primarily due to tax benefits from the Netherlands and foreign tax incentives. 
 Q3 2024 Q3 2023 YTD 2024 YTD 2023 Tax benefit (provision) calculated at EAETR (160) (134) (446) (407) Discrete tax benefit (provision) items (13) 11 (22) 8 Benefit (provision) for income taxes (173) (123) (468) (399) Effective tax rate 19.0 13.4 18.6 15.8 

Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 
 The effective tax rate of 19.0 for the third quarter of 2024 was higher than the EAETR due to the income tax expense for discrete items of 13 million. The discrete items are primarily related to changes in estimates for previous years, and the impact of foreign currency on income tax related items. In addition to this, there was a recapture of tax benefit of 1 million due to a higher EAETR compared to prior quarter. 
 
 YTD 2024 compared to YTD 2023 
 For the first nine months ended 2024 the effective tax rate of 18.6 was higher than 17.7 due to an net result of unfavorable discrete items of 22 million. 
 
 The effective tax rate of 18.6 for the first nine months of 2024 was higher compared to the rate for the first nine months ended 2023 of 15.8 due to a different mix of the benefit (provision) for income taxes in our operating locations, lower foreign tax incentives in the current period as a result of a decrease in qualifying income, newly enacted alternative minimum tax law as per 2024, and also due to the impact of the discrete items in the respective periods. 
 
 Results Relating to Equity-accounted Investees 
 Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 
 Results relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of 6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, whereas the three months ended October 1, 2023 results relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of 2 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations. We continue to generate strong positive operating cash flows. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, our cash balance was 2,748 million, a decrease of 1,114 million compared to December 31, 2023 having fully retired our 1 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.875 senior unsecured notes due March 2024. Taking into account the available amount of the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility of 2,500 million, we had access to 5,248 million of liquidity as of September 29, 2024. We currently use cash to fund operations, meet working capital requirements, for capital expenditures and for potential common stock repurchases, dividends and strategic investments. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current available sources of funds (including cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, RCF Agreement of 2.5 billion, plus anticipated cash generated from operations) will be adequate to finance our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and potential dividends for at least the next twelve months.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a 204 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of lower purchase volumes and timing related to payments, 182 million increase in receivables and other current assets due to the linearity of revenue between the two periods, customer mix, and the related timing of cash collection, 100 million increase in inventories in order to align inventory on hand with expected demand, and 88 million increase in other non-current assets due to movements in our prepayments and balance of insurance reimbursements. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2023 our operating activities provided 2,376 million in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of 2,119 million, adjustments to reconcile the net income of 982 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of (746) million. Adjustments to net income (loss) includes offsetting non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of 837 million, share-based compensation of 304 million and changes in deferred taxes of (170) million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by a 359 million increase in inventories due to increased production levels in order to align inventory on hand with expected demand, 118 million increase in receivables and other current assets due to the linearity of revenue between the two periods, customer mix, and the related timing of cash collection, partially offset by 220 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of timing related to payments. 
 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities amounted to 884 million for the first nine months of 2024 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of 597 million, 193 million for the purchase of investments (driven primarily by the capital contributions of approximately 31 million into ESMC and approximately 140 million into VSMC) and 113 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets, including EDA (electronic design automation). 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities amounted to 879 million for the first nine months of 2023 and principally consisted of the cash outflows for capital expenditures of 652 million, 93 million for the purchase of investments, and 135 million for the purchase of identified intangible assets. 
 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities of 2,621 million for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the payment of 1 billion to retire at maturity our outstanding 4.875 senior unsecured notes due March 2024, dividend payments to common stockholders of 780 million, and purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit holdings of 918 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans of 79 million. 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities of 1,296 million for the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by the dividend payments to common stockholders of 745 million and the purchase of treasury shares and restricted stock unit holdings of 619 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through stock plans of 70 million.

Information Regarding Guarantors of NXP (unaudited) 
 
 Summarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries 
 All debt instruments are guaranteed, fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, by NXP Semiconductors N.V. and issued or guaranteed by NXP USA, Inc., NXP B.V. and NXP LLC, (together, the Subsidiary Obligors and together with NXP Semiconductors N.V., the Obligor Group ). Other than the Subsidiary Obligors, none of the Company s subsidiaries (together the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries guarantee the Notes. The Company consolidates the Subsidiary Obligors in its consolidated financial statements and each of the Subsidiary Obligors are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. 
 
 All of the existing guarantees by the Company rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of the Obligor Group. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from respective subsidiaries by dividend or loan. 
 
 The following tables present summarized financial information of the Obligor Group on a combined basis, with intercompany balances and transactions between entities of the Obligor Group eliminated and investments and equity in the earnings of the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries excluded. The Obligor Group s amounts due from, amounts due to, and intercompany transactions with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries have been disclosed below the table, when material.

 NXP Semiconductors N.V. is the head of a fiscal unity for the corporate income tax and VAT that contains the most significant Dutch wholly-owned group companies. The Company is therefore jointly and severally liable for the tax liabilities of the tax entity as a whole, and as such the income tax expense of the Dutch fiscal unity has been included in the Net income of the Obligor Group. 
 
 The financial information of the Obligor Group includes sales executed through a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary single-billing entity as a sales agent on behalf of an entity in the Obligor Group. The Obligor Group has sales to non-guarantors (for the nine months ended September 29, 2024: 519 million). The Obligor Group has amounts due from equity financing (September 29, 2024: 5,438 million; December 31, 2023: 5,441 million) and due to debt financing (September 29, 2024: 1,779 million; December 31, 2023: 2,346 million) with non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Use of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to providing financial information on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP or GAAP ), NXP also provides selected financial measures on a non-GAAP basis which are adjusted for specified items. The adjustments made to achieve these non-GAAP financial measures or the non-GAAP financial measures as specified are described below, including the usefulness to management and investors. 
 
 In managing NXP s business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXP s business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to core operating performance, certain non-cash expenses and share-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXP s underlying performance. This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management. 
 
 The presentation of these and other similar items in NXP s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure Definition Usefulness to Management and Investors Purchase price accounting effects Purchase price accounting ("PPA") effects reflect the fair value adjustments impacting acquisition accounting and other acquisition adjustments charged to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. This typically relates to inventory, property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as developed technology and marketing and customer relationships acquired. The PPA effects are recorded within both cost of revenue and operating expenses in our US GAAP financial statements. These charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years. We believe that excluding these charges related to fair value adjustments for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures allows the users of our financial statements to better understand the historic and current cost of our products, our gross margin, our operating costs, our operating margin, and also facilitates comparisons to peer companies. Restructuring Restructuring charges are costs primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Charges related to restructuring are recorded within both cost of revenue and operating expenses in our US GAAP financial statements We exclude restructuring charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends. Share-based compensation Share-based compensation consists of incentive expense granted to eligible employees in the form of equity based instruments. Charges related to share-based compensation are recorded within both cost of revenue and operating expenses in our US GAAP financial statements. We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these charges, which are non-cash, are not representative of our core operating performance as they can fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends. Other incidentals Other incidentals consist of certain items which may be non-recurring, unusual, infrequent or directly related to an event that is distinct and non-reflective of the Company s core operating performance. These may include such items as process and product transfer costs, certain charges related to acquisitions and divestitures, litigation and legal settlements, costs associated with the exit of a product line, factory or facility, environmental or governmental settlements, and other items of similar nature. We exclude these certain items which may be non-recurring, unusual, infrequent or directly related to an event that is distinct and non-reflective of the Company s core operating performance for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends. 
 28 

Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure Definition Usefulness to Management and Investors Non-GAAP Provision for income taxes Non-GAAP provision for income taxes is NXP's GAAP provision for income taxes adjusted for the income tax effects of the adjustments to our GAAP measure, including the effects of purchase price accounting PPA ), restructuring costs, share-based compensation, other incidental items and certain other adjustments to financial income (expense) items. Additionally, adjustments are made for the income tax effect of any discrete items that occur in the interim period. Discrete items primarily relate to unexpected tax events that may occur as these amounts cannot be forecasted (e.g., the impact of changes in tax law and/or rates, changes in estimates or resolved tax audits relating to prior year tax provisions, the excess or deficit tax effects on share-based compensation, etc.). The non-GAAP provision for income taxes is used to ascertain and present on a comparable basis NXP's provision for income tax after adjustments, the usefulness of which is described within this table. Additionally, the income tax effects of the adjustments to achieve the noted non-GAAP measures are used to determine NXP's non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to stockholders and accordingly, our diluted non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to stockholders. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow represents operating cash flow adjusted for net additions to property, plant and equipment. We believe that free cash flow provides insight into our cash-generating capability and our financial performance, and is an efficient means by which users of our financial statements can evaluate our cash flow after meeting our capital expenditure. Net debt Net debt represents total debt (short-term and long-term) after deduction of cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits. We believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect of calculating our net leverage. 

The following are reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:
