The Company determines the fair value of investments AFS with the assistance of third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers and other industry and economic events. The Company assessed each debt security in a gross unrealized loss position to determine whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost was a result of credit losses or other factors, whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of the debt security, the Company s intent to sell and whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis. The Company records changes to the allowance for expected credit losses in other income (expense), net. There has been allowance for expected credit losses recorded for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023.

 Overview 
 STAAR Surgical Company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells implantable lenses for the eye and accessory delivery systems used to deliver the lenses into the eye. We are the leading manufacturer of phakic implantable lenses used worldwide in corrective or refractive surgery. We have been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 40 years. Our goal is to position our refractive lenses throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. We generate worldwide revenue almost exclusively from sales of our implantable Collamer lenses, or ICLs. Our ICLs are made from Collamer, which is a proprietary collagen copolymer material created and exclusively used by STAAR to make our lenses soft, flexible and biocompatible with the eye. Our ICLs are phakic lenses, meaning that they are implanted into the eye without removing the eye s natural crystalline lens. This distinguishes an ICL procedure from other refractive procedures, as it does not involve the removal of corneal eye tissue. All of our ICLs are foldable, which allows the surgeon to insert them into the eye through a small incision during minimally invasive surgery. Further, while ICLs are intended to be permanent, our ICLs are reversible lens implants, meaning they can be removed by a doctor if desired. 
 STAAR employs a commercialization strategy that strives for sustainable profitable growth. Our growth strategy includes making our complete ICL product line available in our existing geographic markets and expanding into attractive markets where we do not sell our products today. In addition, we are focused on driving awareness of the ICL procedure and the clinical benefits of our ICLs, and providing surgeon training, support and education, particularly in our newer markets.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses and analyzes data in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provided in this report, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual conditions may differ from our assumptions and actual results may differ from our estimates. 
 Management believes that there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023.

 Total ICL sales for the three months ended September 27, 2024 increased 10 from the same period of 2023, with unit increase of 6 . The APAC region sales increased by 9 , with unit increase of 4 , due to sales growth in China, Japan, India and Korea.

 Other product sales, includes cataract intraocular lenses IOLs ), delivery systems and normal recurring sales adjustments such as sales return allowances. As a result of third-party materials and supply chain challenges that affected our cataract IOLs and associated delivery devices, we have phased out sales of our cataract IOLs as we focus on growing our ICL business. During 2023, we stopped manufacturing cataract IOLs, and we do not plan to sell cataract IOLs in 2024. Other product sales for the three months ended September 27, 2024 decreased 33 from the same period of 2023, due primarily to decreases in cataract IOL sales. Other product sales for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 decreased 150 from 2023 due primarily to a reduction in cataract IOL sales and decreased sales of cataract IOL injector parts.

Gross profit margin decreased to 77.3 of sales for the three months ended September 27, 2024 compared to 79.2 of sales for the three months ended September 29, 2023, due primarily to higher cost per unit as we reduced overall production volume which resulted in less absorption of fixed overhead. Gross profit margin increased to 78.5 of sales for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to 78.0 of sales for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, due changes in reserves related to cataract IOLs recognized in the nine months ended September 29, 2023, and product and geographical sales mix; partially offset by increased period costs associated with manufacturing projects.

The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 were 24.2 and 28.6 , respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 were 34.1 and 31.9 , respectively. Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily due to the income tax expense generated in foreign jurisdictions. 
 Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, investments available for sale AFS and cash flow from operating activities. We believe these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements. We expect that cash flow from operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures, and capital deployment decisions. In addition, future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net sales, the timing and extent of spending to support our growth strategy, the expansion of selling and marketing activities, the timing of introductions of new products, as well as global macroeconomic factors. Our financial condition at September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023 included the following (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances in deposits and money market accounts held at banks and financial institutions.

Investments available for sale may include U.S. government and corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certain certificates deposit and related security types, that are rated by two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations with minimum investment grade ratings of AAA to A-/A-1+ to A-2, or the equivalent. The maturity of individual investments may not extend 24 months from the date of purchase. There are also limits to the amount of credit exposure in any given security type. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Commitments 
 Employment Agreements 
 The Company s Chief Executive Officer entered into an employment agreement with the Company, effective January 1, 2023. He and certain officers have as provisions of their agreements certain rights, including continuance of cash compensation and benefits, upon a change in control, which may include an acquisition of substantially all of its assets, or termination without cause or for good reason as defined in the employment agreements. 
 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Company s qualitative and quantitative market risk since the disclosure in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2023. 
 ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. For purposes of this statement, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the 
 22 

Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including the CEO and the CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud or material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, our internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, or the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and other matters arising in the normal course of business. These legal proceedings and other matters may relate to, among other things, contractual rights and obligations, employment matters, or claims of product liability. The Company maintains insurance coverage for various matters, including product liability and certain securities claims. While the Company does not believe that any of the claims known is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations, new claims or unexpected results of existing claims could lead to significant financial harm. 
 ITEM 1A.	RIS K FACTORS 
 Our short and long-term success is subject to many factors that are beyond our control. Investors and prospective investors should consider carefully information contained in this report and the risks and uncertainties described in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023. Such risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.
