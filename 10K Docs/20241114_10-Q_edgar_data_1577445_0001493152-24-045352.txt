Overview 

Our
primary business activity in prior quarters was enlarging our focus on R D activities in the domain of PdM and CBM (we refer to
these applications as Industry 4.0, or I4.0), including in sectors such as aerospace, maritime energy and other heavy machinery,
engines and complicated mechanics which require ongoing monitoring and predictive maintenance applications. The main effect of this
activity was to enable the Company to accelerate its growth and support an increased workload and solution development
requirements from customers. 

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

The
following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, together with the

Revenues 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 2,660,000, an increase of 1,573,000, or 145 , compared to revenues
of 1,087,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from a Fortune 500 multinational healthcare corporation,
as well as recognition of revenues from Industry 4.0. 

The
increase in revenues from a Fortune 500 multinational healthcare corporation (see note 6 to our interim financial statements) was
mainly due to: 

- 
 an
 increase in the number of units sold and supplied to the customer during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 

- 
 formalization
 of negotiations with the customer, following which the sale price per unit increased significantly compared to the previous sale
 price. 

A
substantial portion of our current revenue comes from a limited number of customers. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenue is primarily comprised of cost of personnel and certain allocated expenses related to facilities, logistics and quality
control. 

Cost
of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,964,000, an increase of 316,000, or 19 , compared to cost of revenues
of 1,648,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues. 

Gross
Profit (Loss) 

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 696,000. Gross loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 561,000. 

The
change was due to both an increase in revenues and an increase in cost of revenues, as described above. 

The
transition from a gross loss to a gross profit was principally attributable to: 

- 
 formalization
 of negotiations with the Fortune 500 multinational healthcare corporation, following which the unit price experienced a substantial
 increase compared to its previous level; and 

- 
 an
 increase in the number of units sold and supplied to the customer during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development efforts are focused on new product development, as well as developing and enhancing functionality for our existing products.
These expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for
personnel engaged in research and development functions, consulting, and professional fees related to research and development activities,
prototype materials, facility costs, and other allocated expenses, including costs related to rent and maintenance of our facilities, utilities,
depreciation, and other supplies. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 

Research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4,705,000, an increase of 598,000, or 15 , compared to
 4,107,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to an
increase in payroll and related expenses for new employee recruitment but also attributable in part to: 

- an
 increase in stock-based compensation due to new options grants; 
 
 - procuring
 materials and employment of subcontractors for Industry 4.0 projects; and 
 
 - development
 of new products. 

We
expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we continue to develop and improve our products and services in the
I4.0 domain. 

- 20 - 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses, consulting services, promotional materials, exhibitions, demonstration
equipment, and certain allocated facility infrastructure costs. 

Sales
and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 806,000, a decrease of 71,000, or 8 , compared to 877,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
decrease in sales and marketing expenses was mainly due to one-time expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30,
2023 which did not reoccur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we
incurred significant expenses related to rebranding activities. These activities included costs associated, inter alia, with
altering our name, design of a new logo, and the creation of new promotional materials. 

We
expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our commercial activity in the I4.0 domain. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and other related costs, including stock-based compensation. General and administrative
expenses also include direct and allocated cost, such as facility-related costs, professional fees, legal, patent, investors and public
relations, accounting, auditing, tax services, and insurance costs. 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 3,929, 000, an increase of 704,000, or 22 , compared
to 3,225,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to: 

- 
 an
 increase in professional services expenses due to the hiring of a financial consultant, IR consultant, HR consultant, and the appointment
 of new directors; 

- 
 an
 increase in payroll and related expenses due to cash compensation bonuses paid to existing employees, including the CEO, CFO, and
 Senior VP of Product Portfolio; and 

- 
 an
 increase in stock-based compensation due to new options grants. 

Operating
loss 

We
incurred an operating loss of 8,744,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 26,000, or 0.3 , compared to
operating loss of 8,770,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
decrease in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in gross profit and a decrease in sales and marketing expenses, partially
offset by increase in expenses related to research and development and general and administrative expenses, each as described above. 

Cash
Flows 

The
following table sets forth the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods set forth below (in dollars): 

Nine month ended September 30,

 (594,000 
 
 Cash provided by Financing Activity 
 9,850,000 
 13,835,000 

Operating
Activities 

Our
primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for payroll expenses, research and development costs, manufacturing costs, marketing
and promotional expenses, professional services costs, and costs related to our facilities. We expect that cash flows related to our operating
activities will continue to increase as our business and our working capital requirements grow. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 5.5 million, consisting of net loss of 8.2 million,
partially offset by a favorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of 1 million and a non-cash benefit of 1.7 million.
Our non-cash benefit consisted primarily of non-cash charges for stock-based compensation. The net change in our operating assets and
liabilities primarily reflects cash inflows from changes in accounts receivable and accrued compensation expenses, partially offset by
outflows from changes in current and non-current other assets and contract liabilities. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 7.3 million, consisting of a net loss of 8.1
million, an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of 0.5 million, partially offset by a non-cash benefit of
 1.3 million. Our non-cash benefit consisted primarily of non-cash charges for stock-based compensation.

of 110,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from a Fortune 500 multinational healthcare corporation,
as well as recognition of revenues from Industry 4.0. 

The
increase in revenues from a Fortune 500 multinational healthcare corporation (see note 6 to our interim financial statements) was
mainly due to: 

- 
 an
 increase in the number of units sold and supplied to the customer during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and

activities will continue to increase as our business and our working capital requirements grow. 

During

For

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments since the year
ended December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 21 million compared to cash and cash equivalents and short-term
deposits of 17 million as of December 31, 2023. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately
 42.4 million, as compared to 34.2 million as of December 31, 2023. 

During July 2024, we closed a
private placement in which we issued 2,144,583 shares of our common stock for a purchase price of 4.80 per share to new and existing
investors resulting in gross proceeds of 10.3 million. 

Our
primary sources of liquidity to date have been from fund-raising and warrant exercises. 

Additional
Cash Requirements 

We
plan to continue to invest in long-term growth, and therefore we expect that our expenses will grow. We currently believe that our existing
cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months. We expect
our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development and the
scale up process of our I4.0 solutions. We expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing,
manufacturing, and distribution. Furthermore, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We may raise these funds
through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our common
stock. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for investors to obtain a return on their
investment in our common stock, or that we will be able to raise sufficient capital required to implement our business plan on acceptable
terms, if at all. Even if we are successful in raising sufficient capital to implement our business plan, we will, most likely, continue
to be unprofitable for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced
to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
