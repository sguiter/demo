 Contract Balances 
 Most of the Company s contracts are for a period of less than one year; however, extended warranty contracts extend beyond one year.

Contract assets include amounts related to the contractual right to consideration for completed performance when the right to consideration is conditional. The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. The fair value of noncash consideration of parts provided by customers is recorded in contract liabilities. Contract assets and contract liabilities are recognized at the contract level.

 Recent Trends and Business Outlook 
 PSI s growth in net revenue for the nine months of 2024 was driven by power systems markets, including data center and oil and gas products, partially offset by lower sales from more mature, lower-margin markets such as transportation. This shift in markets reflects the Company s conscious strategic prioritization towards higher growth, higher-margin markets with less emphasis on more mature markets. 
 27 

The Company is focused on leading the business through a growth phase with a stronger balance sheet while strategically prioritizing products that demonstrate strong demand and higher gross margins. Consistent with those goals, the Company is actively pursuing several initiatives to enhance and expand manufacturing capacity to meet the increasing demand from data center markets. Pivoting the focus to these markets is driving current net sales growth and profitability. Through expanded capacity and strategic partnerships, management expects this positive trend to continue. 
 PSI s business is impacted by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, which has contributed to differing levels of recovery in the global economy. For example, although the oil and gas market, in which the Company has historically operated, has experienced year over year growth from its historic lows, sales levels may not reach their previous higher levels because of rising crude oil prices and lower rig counts. The Company has been actively navigating these challenges by balancing its investments, expenses, pricing and sales efforts in this market as well as others. 
 In addition to prioritizing gross profit, the Company is committed to efficiently managing expenses, including streamlining operating expenses and prioritizing certain R D investments in support of long-term growth objectives. The Company is committed to focusing on growth opportunities and investment while also optimizing its cost structure to enhance growth and profitability, ultimately delivering sustained value to our shareholders. 
 The Company continues to experience inflationary cost pressures for certain raw materials and other goods which the Company continues to try to mitigate through price increases and other cost reduction measures. Additionally, the Company continues to experience ongoing tariff costs for its supply chain products and is trying to mitigate these impacts through price increases and other measures, such as seeking certain tariff exclusions, where possible. The potential for continued economic uncertainty and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact on the levels of future customer orders and the Company s future business operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 10.0 million, or 9 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of higher sales of 23.7 million in the power systems end market, partially offset by a decrease of 7.6 million and 6.2 million within the industrial and transportation end markets, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP above, this report also includes non-GAAP (adjusted) financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide insight into selected financial information and should be evaluated in the context in which they are presented. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. Management does not use these non-GAAP financial measures for any purpose other than the reasons stated below. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure Comparable GAAP Financial Measure Adjusted net income Net income Adjusted net income per share diluted Net income per share diluted EBITDA Net income Adjusted EBITDA Net income 
 The Company believes that Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share diluted, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in its industry as well as by the Company s management in assessing the performance of the Company. Adjusted net income is defined as net income as adjusted for certain items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Adjusted net income per share diluted is a measure of the Company s diluted earnings per common share adjusted for the impact of special items. EBITDA provides the Company with an understanding of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the effects of other non-cash charges and certain other items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company s operations. 
 Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share diluted, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of the Company s operations and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per share diluted, and Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor because these measures are widely used to evaluate companies operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measures, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, the book value of assets, the capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired, among other factors. They are not, however, intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Cash Flows 
 Cash was impacted as follows: 
 (in thousands) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Net cash provided by operating activities 29,739 62,117 (32,378) (52) Net cash used in investing activities (1,957) (2,678) 721 27 Net cash used in financing activities (10,703) (51,739) 41,036 79 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 17,079 7,700 9,379 122 Capital expenditures (1,957) (2,678) 721 27 
 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 29.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 62.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a decrease of 32.4 million in cash provided by operating activities year-over-year. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from a 54.4 million decrease of cash provided by working capital accounts, partially offset by an increase in earnings of 28.1 million. The decrease in cash generated from working capital was primarily related to the increase of prepaid 
 33 

expenses, purchases of inventory, and fewer collections on accounts receivables, offset by decreased payments on accounts payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investin g activities of 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures associated with normal maintenance of the Company s facilities. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 The Company used 10.7 million in cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 51.7 million cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was the net impact from the initial draw on the new Revolving Credit Agreement and payments toward the Shareholder s Loan Agreement and other existing debt year to date. See additional discussion below and in Note 6. Debt , included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements, which further describe the Company s debt arrangements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s sources of funds are cash flows from operations, borrowings made pursuant to its credit facilities and shareholder s loan agreements, and cash and cash equivalents on hand. Principal uses of funds consist of payments of principal interest on our debt facilities and shareholder s loan agreements, capital expenditures, and working capital needs. 
 
 While the Company has achieved profitability and generated positive cash flows from operating activities in 2024, uncertainties exist about the Company s ability to refinance, extend, or repay its outstanding indebtedness. As September 30, 2024 , the Company s total outstanding debt obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Shareholder s Loan Agreement, and for finance leases and other debt were 135.2 million in the aggregate, and its cash and cash equivalents were 40.5 million. See Item 1. Financial Statements , Note 6. Debt , for additional information. 
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on extending and amending, refinancing or repaying the indebtedness outstanding under the Company s existing debt arrangements. Without additional financing, the Company anticipates that it will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to repay amounts owed under its existing debt arrangements as they become due. In order to provide the Company with a more permanent source of liquidity, management plans to seek an extension and amendment and/or replacement of its existing debt agreements or seek additional liquidity from its current or other lenders before the maturity dates in 2025. There can be no assurance that the Company s management will be able to successfully complete an extension and amendment of its existing debt agreements or obtain new financing on acceptable terms, when required or if at all. 
 Despite the recent recovery of the global economy, there continue to be challenges based on the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Average crude oil prices reached the highest average price in five years in 2022 but have steadily declined while remaining near historically high 5-year averages at the end of the third quarter 2024. Rig counts in the U.S. oil markets remain below historical levels as of the third quarter of 2024. Despite increasing rig counts and historically high crude oil prices, the Company believes that capital spending within the areas of the oil and gas market that it participates in remains below historical levels. While the Company saw an increase of sales to customers with traditional exposure to the oil and gas markets during 2023, as compared to the prior year, sales remain below historic levels. A significant portion of the Company s sales and profitability has historically been derived from the sale of products that are used within the oil and gas industry. The Company continues to experience inflationary cost pressures for certain raw materials and other goods which the Company continues to try to mitigate through price increases and other cost reduction measures. Additionally, the Company continues to experience ongoing tariff costs for products and is trying to mitigate these impacts through price increases and other measures, such as seeking certain tariff exclusions, where possible. The potential for continued economic uncertainty and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact on the levels of future customer orders and the Company s future business operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Lastly, national inflationary pressures have continued to cause interest rates to remain elevated. Although the Company s interest expense has decreased because of reduced debt balances, it may be subject to future increases from these inflationary pressures. Accordingly, the above challenges may continue to have a material adverse impact on the Company s future results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 
 Due to these uncertainties, the Company s management has concluded that, substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. The Company s plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful, and it may be forced to limit its 
 34 

business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had four outstanding letters of credit totaling 1.4 million . See Item 1. Financial Statements , Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements and the outstanding letters of credit. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based on information available when they are made and, therefore, may differ from estimates made under different assumptions or conditions. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are consistent with those discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information , to the consolidated financial statements and the MD A section of the Company s 2023 Annual Report. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in the application of critical accounting policies. 
 The Company has identified the following accounting policies as its most critical because they require the Company to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments and estimates: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 Warranty 
 Impact of New Accounting Standards 
 For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information , included in Part 1, Item 1.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information under this item. 
 36 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
