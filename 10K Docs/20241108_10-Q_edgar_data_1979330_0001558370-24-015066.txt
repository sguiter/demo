 last of layer hedges on a significant portion of its fixed rate residential loan pool. These amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to remain at the end of the hedging relationship. During September 2021, the Company terminated these last of layer hedges by paying out million to the respective third parties. These fees were capitalized into loans receivable and are being amortized against loan income over the contractual lives of the remaining designated residential loans. The unamortized amount of this cost basis adjustment is and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized amortization expense related to this cost basis adjustment of and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized amortization expense related to this cost basis adjustment of and , respectively. Non-designated Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements and/or the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships, exclusive of credit valuation adjustments, are recorded directly in earnings. The Company executes interest rate swaps and cap agreements with commercial banking customers to facilitate its respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swap and cap agreements are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps and caps that are executed with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million compared to interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of million related to this program as of December 31, 2023. Risk Participation Agreements Risk Participation Agreements RPAs are guarantees issued by the Company to other parties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party. Under the terms of these agreements, the participating bank receives a fee from the lead bank in exchange for the guarantee of reimbursement if the customer defaults on an interest rate swap. The interest rate swap is transacted such that any and all exchanges of interest payments (favorable and unfavorable) are made between the lead bank and the customer. In the event that an early termination of the swap occurs, and the customer is unable to make a required close out payment, the participating bank assumes that obligation and is required to make this payment. RPAs where the Company acts as the lead bank are referred to as participations-out, in reference to the credit risk associated with the customer derivatives being transferred out of the Company. Participations-out generally occur concurrently with the sale of new customer derivatives. RPAs where the Company acts as the participating bank are referred to as participations-in, in reference to the credit risk associated with the counterparty s derivatives being assumed by the Company. The Company s maximum credit exposure is based on its proportionate share of the settlement amount of the referenced interest rate swap. Settlement amounts are generally calculated based on the fair value of the swap plus outstanding accrued interest receivable from the customer.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing on Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;

 statements regarding the quality of our loan portfolio; and estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: weakening in the United States economy in general and the regional and local economies within the Company s market area; the effects of inflationary pressures, labor market shortages and/or supply chain issues; the instability or volatility in financial markets and unfavorable general business conditions, globally, nationally or regionally, whether caused by geopolitical concerns, recent disruptions in the banking industry, or other factors; unanticipated loan delinquencies, loss of collateral, decreased service revenues, and other potential negative effects on our business caused by severe weather, pandemics or other external events; changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, our mortgage banking revenues, the fair value of financial instruments, including our mortgage servicing rights asset, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans; the effect of any change in federal government enforcement of federal laws affecting the cannabis industry; changes in liquidity, including the size and composition of our deposit portfolio, including the percentage of uninsured deposits in the portfolio; our ability to access cost-effective funding; fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; demand for loans and deposits in our market area; our ability to implement and change our business strategies; competition among depository and other financial institutions; adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets; changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;

 the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; our ability to manage market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, compliance risk, and operational risk; our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; our ability to attract and retain key employees; and changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 
 Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024. Allowance for Credit Losses The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology for loans measured at amortized cost. The allowance for credit losses is established based upon the Company's current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses. Arriving at an appropriate amount of allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment. The Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. Management's judgement is required for the selection and application of these factors which are derived from historical loss experience as well as assumptions surrounding expected future losses and economic forecasts. Loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and are removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting. For the loans that are individually assessed, the Company uses either a discounted cash flow DCF approach or a fair value of collateral approach. The latter approach is used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable. Changes in these judgements and assumptions could be due to a number of circumstances which may have a direct impact on the provision for credit losses and may result in changes to the amount of allowance. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management's assessments confirm that the Company will not collect the full amortized cost basis of a loan.

 Income Taxes We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments may require us to make projections of future taxable income and/or to carryback to taxable income in prior years. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Securities Valuation We classify our debt securities as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value. We obtain our fair values from one or more third-party services. These services fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For any available-for-sale debt security with a fair value less than its amortized cost basis, we will determine whether we have the intent to sell the available-for-sale debt security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either condition is met, the Company will recognize a full impairment charge to earnings. For all other available-for-sale debt securities that don't meet either condition and that have expected credit losses, the credit loss will be recognized in earnings. Any non-credit related loss impairment related to all other factors will be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Management also assesses the nature of the unrealized losses taking into consideration factors such as changes in risk-free interest rates, general credit spread changes, market supply and demand, creditworthiness of the issuer, and quality of the underlying collateral. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including operating net income, operating noninterest expense, operating noninterest income, operating earnings per share, basic, operating earnings per share, diluted, operating return on average assets, operating return on average shareholders equity, operating efficiency ratio, tangible shareholders equity, tangible assets, tangible book value per share, and efficiency ratio. The Company s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a Company s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Total assets increased 469.1 million, or 10.3 , to 5.00 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 4.53 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases in net loans, BOLI, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 44.5 million, or 16.3 , to 317.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from 272.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to deposit growth outpacing loan and investment growth, offset partially by paydowns of FHLB borrowings, purchases of BOLI policies and increases in prepaid and other assets. Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale increased 13.1 million, or 6.9 , to 202.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 189.5 million as of December 31, 2023 due to purchases of U.S. treasuries, government agency and corporate bond debt securities. The Company sold 29.3 million in available-for-sale debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the proceeds reinvested into higher-yielding available-for-sale debt securities, which were restructured to mitigate portfolio risk and increase yield. Loans. Net loans increased 354.4 million, or 9.2 , to 4.21 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 3.86 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from increases in: commercial real estate loans, which increased 110.1 million, or 9.4 ; commercial and industrial loans, which increased 75.0 million, or 15.3 ; multi-family residential loans, which increased 62.6 million, or 29.8 ; construction and development loans which increased 44.1 million, or 7.1 ; consumer loans, which increased 29.6 million, or 14.4 ; and one-to-four family residential loans, which increased 26.5 million, or 2.4 . The increase in our loan portfolio reflects our strategy to prudently grow the balance sheet by continuing to diversify into these higher-yielding loans to improve net margins and manage interest rate risk. The Company had approximately 458.0 million and 365.9 million in loans to borrowers in the cannabis industry at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of that total, 301.9 million and 207.7 million were direct loans to cannabis companies and were collateralized by real estate at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 FHLB Stock. The FHLB is a cooperative bank that provides services to its member financial institutions. The primary reason for our membership in the FHLB is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding and as a tool to manage interest rate risk. We held an investment in FHLB stock of 6.8 million and 14.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The amount of stock we are required to purchase is in proportion to our FHLB borrowings and level of total assets. Accordingly, the decrease in the FHLB stock from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is due to the decrease in FHLB borrowings. BOLI. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company surrendered 46.7 million of existing BOLI policies that were earning an annualized yield of 3.08 . Prior to the surrender of the policies, the Company purchased an additional 50.0 million of BOLI policies, which are currently yielding 4.81 . As a result of the surrender of the BOLI policies, the Company incurred 1.6 million of income tax and penalty, which the Company expects to earn back in less than two years. The insurance carriers have six months to pay out the proceeds from the surrendered policies, and as a result, the Company expects BOLI to be at higher balances and to continue earning income related to the increase in cash surrender value until the proceeds are received, which will further shorten the earn-back period on the income tax and penalty amount. Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Prepaid expenses and other assets consist primarily of right of use assets related to our long-term leases, income taxes receivables and derivatives with a positive fair value. These assets increased 21.4 million, or 40.4 , to 74.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 53.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from an 18.9 million increase in income taxes receivables as a result of earned solar income tax credits and a 2.4 million increase in right of use assets resulting from a lease extension. Deposits. Deposits increased 655.5 million, or 19.4 , to 4.04 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 3.39 billion as of December 31, 2023. Core deposits (which we define as all deposits including certificates of deposit, other than brokered deposits) increased 509.1 million, or 15.9 , to 3.71 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 3.20 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was the result of growth in customer deposits, primarily certificates of deposit, which increased 360.1 million, or 27.4 , from December 31, 2023, along with money market accounts and noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts, which increased 147.4 million, or 16.6 , and 32.4 million, or 6.1 , respectively, from December 31, 2023. Additionally, brokered deposits increased 146.3 million, or 79.7 , from December 31, 2023, as a result of lower rates versus alternative funding sources and to support overall liquidity. The Company had 302.3 million and 277.5 million in deposits from the cannabis industry as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. FHLB Borrowings. FHLB borrowings decreased 167.0 million, or 58.9 , to 116.3 million as of September 30, 2024 from 283.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was the result of overall deposit growth and growth in brokered deposits due to lower rates. Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased 11.8 million, or 14.5 , to 69.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 81.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease resulted from 15.8 million in IPO-related and other accrued expenses, 5.6 million reduction in accrued incentive bonuses resulting from bonuses being paid partially offset by current period accruals, and a 2.6 million reduction in allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments; offset partially by a 5.6 million increase in deferred solar tax credit investments resulting from a future expected capital call, a 2.6 million increase in deferred tax liabilities related to a basis reduction on solar tax credits, a 2.5 million increase in lease liabilities resulting from a lease extension and a 1.7 million increase in accrued interest on brokered deposits resulting from increased utilization of brokered deposits. Shareholders Equity. Total shareholders equity decreased 10.5 million, or 1.4 , to 747.4 million as of September 30, 2024 from 758.0 million as of December 31, 2023, due to the 31.6 million increase in the unallocated common shares held by the ESOP resulting from the purchase of shares on the open market to fund the ESOP as a result of the conversion , along with the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-02 of 10.2 million , offset partially by 26.5 million in net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 16.4 million, or 27.5 , to 76.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 59.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 13.8 million, or 24.4 , increase in interest and fees on loans and a 2.5 million, or 245.6 , increase in interest on short-term investments. The increase in interest and fees on loans was primarily due to an increase of 564.7 million, or 15.6 , in the average balance of the loan portfolio to 4.19 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.62 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and an increase of 49 basis points in the weighted average yield for the loan portfolio to 6.70 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 6.21 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the growth of our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The increase in interest income on short-term investments was primarily due to an increase of 183.0 million, or 224.9 , in the average balance of short-term investments to 264.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 81.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Total interest expense increased 8.6 million, or 32.8 , to 34.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 26.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased 12.8 million, or 61.7 , to 33.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 20.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit of 495.3 million to 1.94 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 1.45 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase in the weighted average rate on certificates of deposit of 91 basis points to 5.02 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 4.11 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in the weighted average rate on money market accounts of 129 basis points to 4.06 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 2.77 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 7.8 million, or 23.4 , to 41.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 33.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an 738.9 million, or 18.7 , increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to 4.69 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.95 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets of 46 basis points to 6.45 September 30, 2024 from 5.99 September 30, 2023. These increases were offset partially by an increase in the weighted average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 80 basis points to 4.13 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.33 September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of 233.1 million, or 7.5 , to 3.34 billion September 30, 2024 from 3.11 billion September 30, 2023. Provision for Credit Losses. Based on management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, a provision of 2.6 million was recorded for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, of which 5.0 million related to the provision for credit losses on loans, compared to a provision of 2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments decreased 2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a reduction in qualitative factors on construction commitments, as well as, the reduction in the balance of unfunded commitments. The increase of 3.0 million, or 154.3 , in the total provision for credit losses was primarily due to the overall increase in the size of the loan portfolio and increases in the qualitative factors on loans collateralized by purchased consumer loans. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 1.9 million, or 59.7 , to 1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from losses of sale on available-for-sale debt securities of 1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The table below sets forth our noninterest income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Customer service fees 1,963 1,689 274 16.22 Loss on sale of available-for-sale securities, net (1,868) (1,868) (100.00) Increase in cash surrender value of BOLI 414 374 40 10.70 Mortgage banking income 367 101 266 263.37 Swap contract income 375 950 (575) (60.53) Other income 14 24 (10) (41.67) Total noninterest income 1,265 3,138 (1,873) (59.69) Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 1.5 million, or 6.5 , to 24.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 23.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased 2.5 million, or 17.3 , resulting primarily from the hiring of additional employees consistent with our business strategy to grow the Bank, annual salary raises, 762,000 in ESOP compensation expenses and a 667,000 increase in long-term incentive plan expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increases in salaries and employee benefit expenses were offset partially by general and administrative expenses decreasing 1.3 million, or 91.7 , as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02, resulting in a 1.4 million decrease in solar income tax credit amortization during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The table below sets forth our noninterest expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 17,202 14,659 2,543 17.35 Director and professional service fees 1,995 1,609 386 23.99 Occupancy and equipment expenses 1,394 1,279 115 8.99 Data processing expenses 2,226 2,017 209 10.36 Marketing and charitable contribution expenses 842 918 (76) (8.28) FDIC and state insurance assessments 812 1,215 (403) (33.17) General and administrative expenses 115 1,391 (1,276) (91.73) Total noninterest expense 24,586 23,088 1,498 6.49

 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased 3.9, or 125.6 , to 7.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 45.5 and 26.8 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was a result of the 2.5 million tax effect of the basis reduction on solar income tax credits earned and the 1.6 million income tax and penalty on the surrender of BOLI policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding these one-time income tax expenses, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 19.1 . Average Balances and Yields.

Table of Contents 
 The increase in interest and fees on loans was primarily due to an increase of 670.0 million, or 20.0 , in the average balance of the loan portfolio to 4.03 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.36 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase of 64 basis points in the weighted average yield for the loan portfolio to 6.63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the growth of our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The increase in interest on short-term investments was primarily due to an increase of 181.9 million, or 313.1 , in the average balance of short-term investments to 239.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 58.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-earning assets increased 822.4 million, or 22.4 , to 4.50 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.67 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 66 basis points to 6.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 35.2 million, or 57.3 , to 96.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 61.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased 42.9 million, or 84.8 , to 93.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the weighted average rate on certificates of deposit of 139 basis points to 4.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit of 451.5 million, or 33.1 , to 1.82 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.36 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in the weighted average rate on money market accounts of 154 basis points to 3.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average balance of money market accounts of 95.0 million, or 12.5 to 855.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 760.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in the average balance of FHLB advances was the result of growth in brokered deposits due to lower rates, as well as, overall deposit growth. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 22.2 million, or 23.1 , to 118.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 822.4 million, or 22.4 , increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to 4.50 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.67 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets of 66 basis points to 6.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were offset partially by an increase in the weighted average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 121 basis points to 4.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of 296.7 million, or 10.2 , to 3.20 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.90 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Based on management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, a provision of 10.7 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 13.3 million related to the provision for credit losses on loans, compared to a provision of 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments decreased 2.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a reduction in qualitative factors on construction commitments, as well as, the reduction in the balance of unfunded commitments. The increase of 2.6 million, or 32.7 , in the total provision for credit losses was primarily due to the overall increase in the size of the loan portfolio and increases in the qualitative factors on loans collateralized by purchased consumer loans.

 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 4.4 million, or 36.0 , to 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from one-time employee retention credit income of 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, losses of sale on available-for-sale debt securities of 1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 930,000 decrease in swap contract income resulting from lower swap transaction volume; offset partially by an increase in other income resulting from a one-time debit and credit card branding signing bonus of 610,000 and increased customer service fees of 758,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The table below sets forth our noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Customer service fees 5,717 4,959 758 15.29 Loss on sale of available-for-sale securities, net (1,868) (1,868) (100.00) Increase in cash surrender value of BOLI 1,219 1,117 102 9.13 Mortgage banking income 905 469 436 92.96 Swap contract income 1,128 2,058 (930) (45.19) Employee retention credit income - 3,452 (3,452) (100.00) Other income 649 46 603 1310.87 Total noninterest income 7,750 12,101 (4,351) (35.96) Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 7.9 million, or 11.6 , to 76.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 68.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased 7.5 million, or 17.0 , primarily from the hiring of additional employees consistent with our business strategy to grow the Bank, annual salary increases, a 2.0 million increase in ESOP compensation expenses, a 1.6 million increase in long term incentive plan expenses, a 627,000 increase in medical and dental benefits, a 477,000 in 401(k) match expenses and a 309,000 increase in federal payroll taxes; offset partially by a 1.2 million decrease in pension expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Director and professional service fees increased 1.2 million, or 23.9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily the result of higher legal fees, lending services, appraisal fee and external audit costs. Data processing expenses increased 1.1 million, or 20.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily the result of higher electronic banking, information technology and system costs. The above increases were partially offset by decreased FDIC and state insurance assessments of 1.0 million, or 36.5 , and general and administrative expenses of 783,000, or 18.45 , as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02, which resulted in a 1.2 million decrease in amortization of solar income tax credits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The table below sets forth our noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 51,509 44,033 7,476 16.98 Director and professional service fees 6,174 4,985 1,189 23.85 Occupancy and equipment expenses 4,192 3,926 266 6.78 Data processing expenses 6,547 5,456 1,091 20.00 Marketing and charitable contribution expenses 2,680 2,972 (292) (9.83) FDIC and state insurance assessments 1,806 2,844 (1,038) (36.50) General and administrative expenses 3,459 4,243 (784) (18.48) Total noninterest expense 76,367 68,459 7,908 11.55 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense increased 4.2 million, or 49.6 , to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 32.5 and 26.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was a result of the 2.5 million tax effect of the basis reduction on solar income tax credits earned and the 1.6 million income tax and penalty on the surrender of BOLI policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding these one-time income tax expenses, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 22.2 .

 Average Balances and Yields. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. All average balances are daily average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense; such fees, discounts and premiums were not material for the periods presented.

 Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Increase (Decrease) Due to Total Increase Volume Rate (Decrease) (In thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans 32,124 17,162 49,286 Securities (339) 1,463 1,124 Other (215) (551) (766) Short-term investments 7,414 395 7,809 Total interest-earning assets 38,984 18,469 57,453 Interest-bearing liabilities: Savings accounts (10) 1 (9) NOW accounts (28) 215 187 Money market accounts 1,872 9,671 11,543 Certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts 14,288 16,850 31,138 Total interest-bearing deposits 16,122 26,737 42,859 Federal Home Loan Bank advances (7,508) (133) (7,641) Total interest-bearing liabilities 8,614 26,604 35,218 Change in net interest income 30,370 (8,135) 22,235 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We are also able to borrow from the FHLB and the Discount Window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston FRB ). As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding advances of 116.3 million from the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity of 730.7 million with the FHLB and 36.6 million available with the FRB. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Bank received approval from the FRB under its Borrower in Custody BIC program, which allowed us to pledge commercial real estate and multi-family loans to the FRB, which provided the Bank with additional borrowing capacity of 531.6 million. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had 329.9 million of brokered deposits and pursuant to our internal liquidity policy, which allows us to utilize brokered deposits up to 25.0 of our total assets, we had an additional capacity of up to approximately 920.7 million of brokered deposits. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

Table of Contents 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 75.8 million in commitments to originate loans outstanding. In addition, we had 477.6 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers, 487.5 million in unadvanced construction loans and 6.5 million in letters of credit outstanding. Non-brokered certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 1.65 billion, or 40.9 , of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we may be required to seek other sources of funds, including brokered deposits, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the non-brokered certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2025, or on our other interest-bearing deposit accounts. We believe, however, based on historical experience and current market interest rates that we will retain upon maturity a large portion of our certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less as of September 30, 2024. Our primary investing activity is originating loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 345.4 million of loans, net of repayments. Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances. We experienced net increases in deposits of 655.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the level of brokered time deposits was 329.9 million and 183.6 million, respectively. Deposit flows are affected primarily by the overall level of interest rates and the interest rates and products offered by us and our competitors. FHLB advances decreased 167.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included as part of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We continuously monitor our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate by management. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding planning process, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. In addition, based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. As of September 30, 2024, Needham Bank and NB Bancorp, Inc. exceeded all of their regulatory capital requirements, and were categorized as well-capitalized at that date. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification of well-capitalized status that would change our category. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable, as the Registrant is an emerging growth company.
