 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Statements contained in this report that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified as such because the statements include words such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, project, will, projections, estimate, or other words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe future financial performance or plans or strategies are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL that could materially affect actual results include:

 changes in the price of delivered natural gas, transmission, purchased electric energy, purchased electric capacity and delivered coal, particularly during elevated market prices, and any resulting changes to counterparty credit risk, due to shifts in supply and demand caused by market conditions, regulations and MISO s seasonal resource adequacy process; 
 the ability to obtain regulatory approval for construction projects with acceptable conditions; 
 the ability to complete construction of renewable generation and storage projects by planned in-service dates and within the cost targets set by regulators due to cost increases of and access to materials, equipment and commodities, which could result from tariffs, duties or other assessments, such as any additional tariffs resulting from U.S. Department of Commerce investigations into and any decisions made regarding the sourcing of solar project materials and equipment from certain countries, labor issues or supply shortages, the ability to successfully resolve warranty issues or contract disputes; 
 the ability to achieve the expected level of tax benefits based on tax guidelines, timely in-service dates, project costs and the level of electricity output generated by qualifying generating facilities, and the ability to efficiently utilize the renewable generation and storage project tax benefits to achieve IPL s authorized rate of return and for the benefit of IPL s and WPL s customers; 
 the impacts of changes in the tax code, including tax rates, minimum tax rates, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes impacting the availability of and ability to transfer renewable tax credits; 
 the ability to utilize tax credits generated to date, and those that may be generated in the future, before they expire, as well as the ability to transfer tax credits that may be generated in the future at adequate pricing; 
 the ability to provide sufficient generation and the ability of ITC Midwest LLC and ATC to provide sufficient transmission capacity for potential load growth; 
 the ability of potential large load growth customers to timely construct new facilities;

 AROs - Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the recognition of additional ARO regulatory assets in the second quarter of 2024, substantially resulting from the enactment of the revised CCR Rule. 
 
 Assets retired early - In May 2023, IPL retired the Lansing Generating Station. IPL was previously allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this EGU from both its retail and wholesale customers. In September 2024, the IUC approved the June 2024 partial non-unanimous settlement agreement between IPL and certain stakeholders for IPL s retail electric rate review for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. The agreement includes a return of the remaining net book value of Lansing, but does not include a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing, effective October 1, 2024. As a result, the return on the remaining net book value is no longer recoverable from IPL s retail electric customers, and a pre-tax non-cash charge of million was recorded to Asset valuation charge for IPL s Lansing Generating Station in Alliant Energy s and IPL s income statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with a corresponding decrease in Alliant Energy s and IPL s assets retired early regulatory assets.

 Tax-related - The increase in Alliant Energy s and WPL s tax-related regulatory liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to tax benefits resulting from WPL electing investment tax credit treatment for its Cassville solar facility in the second quarter of 2024. A majority of these benefits will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding, with a portion of the benefits passed on to WPL s electric customers in 2024 and 2025. 
 
 Rate Reviews - 
 IPL s Retail Electric and Gas Rate Reviews (October 2024 through September 2025 Forward-looking Test Period) - In September 2024, the IUC issued an order authorizing annual base rate increases of million for IPL s retail electric customers, with customers receiving partially offsetting credits for the first 12 months through a tax benefit rider, and million for IPL s retail gas customers, for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. Rate changes were effective October 1, 2024, and are currently subject to procedural reviews by the IUC. The IUC s order also reflects the following: 
 Electric earnings sharing mechanism beginning in calendar year 2025, where IPL would apply excess earnings to the remaining net book value of IPL s highest earning asset with advance ratemaking principles (currently the Emery Generation Station) based on its authorized return on common equity; 
 Investment tax credits resulting from renewable generation and battery storage projects may be utilized to offset any revenue deficiency on an annual basis up to IPL s return on common equity threshold; any remaining investment tax credits, net of the cost of transferability, that are not used to offset any revenue deficiency, will be deferred by IPL and carried forward to offset any revenue deficiency in future years; and 
 Discontinuation of the renewable energy rider. 

NOTE 3. 
 MW of new solar generation will exceed the construction cost estimates previously approved by the PSCW by approximately million. In February 2024, the PSCW issued an order approving deferral of the incremental solar generation construction costs. The PSCW s order did not authorize a deferral for the return on such costs. In March 2024, WPL filed for judicial review of the PSCW s retail electric rate review order (2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period) and solar generation construction cost deferral order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. In September 2024, the PSCW issued an order modifying its February 2024 order and approving the deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs, and in October 2024, WPL withdrew its filing for judicial review. Alliant Energy and WPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of September 30, 2024 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred. 
 
 In September 2024, the IUC approved IPL s settlement agreement with certain stakeholders for its retail electric rate review for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. The settlement agreement allows IPL to recover construction costs associated with its MW of new solar generation, including allowance for funds used during construction and transmission upgrade costs among other costs, above the original cost target of /kilowatt up to /kilowatt. The costs up to the original cost target of /kilowatt will earn a return on common equity of . The costs between /kilowatt and /kilowatt will earn a return on common equity that is the same as other assets without advance rate-making principles, without having to establish that such costs were reasonably and prudently incurred. Alliant Energy and IPL currently do not expect these construction costs will exceed 1,837.5/kilowatt. 
 
 In May 2024, WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL previously planned to retire the EGU by June 1, 2025. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, Alliant Energy and WPL concluded Edgewater Unit 5 (net book value of million) no longer meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and million was reclassified to utility electric generation plant in service from utility electric plant anticipated to be retired early. 
 
 WPL is currently leasing the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility from AEF s Non-utility Generation business. WPL is responsible for the operation of the EGU and has exclusive rights to its output. In May 2024, WPL renewed this financing lease through 2044. There are lease renewal periods remaining.

Non-current derivative assets Current derivative liabilities Non-current derivative liabilities 
 
 Based on IPL s and WPL s cost recovery mechanisms, the majority of changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities/assets result in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets. 
 
 Credit Risk-related Contingent Features - Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings. Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments. In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered. 
 
 Balance Sheet Offsetting - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets. 
 Derivative liabilities December 31, 2023 Derivative assets Derivative liabilities 
 
 Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. 
 
 Interest Rate Derivative - The interest rate derivative associated with AEF s interest rate swap maturing in January 2026 was valued based on quoted prices that utilize current market interest rate forecasts. As of September 30, 2024, million of non-current interest rate derivative liabilities was recorded in Other liabilities on Alliant Energy s balance sheet. This interest rate derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge, with changes in fair value recorded as other comprehensive income/loss. As of September 30, 2024, accumulated other comprehensive loss included million of losses related to the interest rate swap. Reductions to interest expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were recorded in Alliant Energy s income statement related to the interest rate swap.

 NOTE 14(c) Guarantees and Indemnifications - 
 Whiting Petroleum Corporation (Whiting Petroleum) - In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum, an independent oil and gas company. Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, has guaranteed the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under multiple general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry. The guarantees do not include a maximum limit. Based on information made available to Alliant Energy by Whiting Petroleum, the Whiting Petroleum affiliate holds an approximate share in the partnerships, and currently known obligations include costs associated with the future abandonment of certain facilities owned by the partnerships. The general partnerships were formed under California law, and Alliant Energy Resources, LLC may need to perform under the guarantees if the affiliate of Whiting Petroleum is unable to meet its partnership obligations. 
 
 Whiting Petroleum previously completed bankruptcy proceedings and business combinations, which substantially reduce the likelihood that Alliant Energy will be obligated to make any payments under these guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, the currently known partnership obligations for the abandonment obligations are estimated at million, which represents Alliant Energy s currently estimated maximum exposure under the guarantees. Alliant Energy is not currently aware of, nor does it currently expect to incur in the future, any material liabilities related to these guarantees and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to these guarantees as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Non-utility Wind Farm in Oklahoma - In 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF acquired a cash equity ownership interest in a non-utility wind farm located in Oklahoma. The wind farm provides electricity to a third party under a long-term purchased power agreement (PPA). Alliant Energy provided a parent guarantee of its subsidiary s indemnification obligations under the related operating agreement and PPA. Alliant Energy s obligations under the operating agreement were million as of September 30, 2024 and will reduce annually until expiring in July 2047. Alliant Energy s obligations under the PPA are subject to a maximum limit of million and expire in December 2031, subject to potential extension. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to this guarantee that it is probable that it will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million and million, respectively, of proceeds for renewable tax credits transferred to other corporate taxpayers in the event of an adverse interpretation of tax law, including whether the related tax credits meet the qualification requirements. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe the likelihood of having to make any material cash payments under these indemnifications is remote. 
 
 NOTE 14(d) Environmental Matters - 
 Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) Sites - IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs. IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment.

 Current and non-current environmental liabilities 
 
 IPL Consent Decree - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential Clean Air Act issues associated with emissions from IPL s coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa. IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. IPL s remaining requirements include fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from IPL s electric customers. 
 
 Other Environmental Contingencies - In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations. Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however, future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs and electric and gas distribution systems to comply with certain of these rules could be significant. Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, Effluent Limitation Guidelines, CCR Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, including the Clean Air Act. 
 
 NOTE 14(e) MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints - A group of stakeholders, including MISO cooperative and municipal utilities, previously filed complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requesting a reduction to the base return on equity authorized for MISO transmission owners, including ITC Midwest LLC and ATC. In 2019, FERC issued an order on the previously filed complaints and reduced the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners to for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2020, FERC issued orders in response to various rehearing requests and increased the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners from to for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016. In 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated FERC s prior orders that established the base return on equity authorized for the MISO transmission owners and remanded the cases to FERC for further proceedings. In October 2024, FERC issued an order reducing the base return on equity authorized for MISO transmission owners to , effective September 28, 2016. As a result, the MISO transmission owners will provide refunds based on the base return on equity, with interest, for November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015, and subsequent to September 28, 2016, which is not expected to result in any material impacts on Alliant Energy s results of operations or financial condition. Any further changes in FERC s decisions may have an impact on Alliant Energy s share of ATC s future earnings and customer costs; however, Alliant Energy is currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of any further changes. 
 
 NOTE 14(f) Collective Bargaining Agreements - In August 2024, IPL s collective bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) expired. A new agreement was reached in September 2024, which expires August 31, 2028.

2024 HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 Key highlights since the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K include the following: 
 
 Customer Investments: 
 In March 2024, IPL completed construction of the first phase of the Duane Arnold solar facility (50 MW in Linn County, Iowa). 
 In April 2024, the PSCW issued orders authorizing WPL to construct improvements at the natural gas-fired Neenah Energy Facility and Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility, which would increase the capacity and efficiency of the EGUs. 
 In April 2024 and June 2024, IPL and WPL entered into agreements to transfer a portion of the renewable tax credits generated in 2024 and 2025 from certain wind, solar and battery storage facilities to other corporate taxpayers in exchange for cash. 
 In May 2024, WPL completed construction of the Grant County solar facility (200 MW in Grant County, Wisconsin). 
 In May 2024, WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL previously planned to retire the EGU by June 1, 2025. 
 In July 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations awarded WPL s Columbia Energy Storage Project, a 20 MW carbon dioxide-based long-duration energy storage system at the Columbia Energy Center site, up to approximately 30 million in grant funding during construction of the project. In August 2024, WPL filed a certificate of authority application with the PSCW for construction approval of the energy storage system. A decision from the PSCW is currently expected in 2025. 
 In July 2024, WPL filed a certificate of authority application with the PSCW for approval to refurbish the Bent Tree wind farm, which would be eligible for production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. A decision from the PSCW is currently expected in 2025. 
 In October 2024, IPL completed construction of the Creston solar facility (50 MW in Union County, Iowa). 
 In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Grid Deployment selected WPL s Smart Power Automation for Rural Communities program application to move into the final stage of award negotiations for up to 50 million in grant funding under the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships Program. WPL currently expects to submit project plans to the PSCW in 2025 when award negotiations are nearing completion. Any grant proceeds would reduce the cost of the project for WPL s customers. 
 
 Rate Matters: 
 In October 2023, IPL filed a retail electric and gas rate review with the IUC for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. In June 2024, IPL reached a partial, non-unanimous settlement agreement with certain stakeholders, which was approved by the IUC in September 2024. Rate changes were effective October 1, 2024, and are currently subject to procedural reviews by the IUC. The IUC s order reflects the following: 
 Annual retail electric base rate increase of 185 million, with customers receiving partially offsetting credits for the first 12 months through a tax benefit rider, a subsequent retail electric base rate moratorium through September 2029, and an average retail electric rate base of 7,279 million; 
 During the moratorium, IPL may request updated rates if its actual return on common equity is 100 or more basis points below the authorized return on common equity for a single calendar year or 50 or more basis points below the authorized return on common equity for two consecutive years, and/or if a material change in laws or regulations causes the moratorium to become unsustainable; 
 Annual retail gas base rate increase of 10 million, and an average retail gas rate base of 630 million; 
 Return on common equity of 9.65 (for all assets that to do not have advance ratemaking principles) and a 51 common equity component of its regulatory capital structure; 
 Key drivers include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base, including investments in solar generation, as well as updated depreciation rates and certain incremental costs and benefits incurred resulting from the 2020 derecho windstorm; 
 Electric earnings sharing mechanism beginning in calendar year 2025, where IPL would apply excess earnings to the remaining net book value of IPL s highest earning asset with advance ratemaking principles (currently the Emery Generation Station) based on its authorized return on common equity as follows; 
 Threshold Above Authorized Return on Common Equity Sharing First 50 basis points 75 customers, 25 IPL >50 to 100 basis points 50 customers, 50 IPL >100 to 150 basis points 25 customers, 75 IPL >150 basis points 100 customers 
 Investment tax credits resulting from renewable generation and battery storage projects may be utilized to offset any revenue deficiency on an annual basis up to IPL s return on common equity threshold. Any remaining investment tax credits, net of the cost of transferability, that are not used to offset any revenue deficiency, will be deferred by IPL and carried forward to offset any revenue deficiency in future years. 
 Creation of an individual customer rate tariff, which would allow IPL to attract new load growth to its service territory; 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Electric distribution system investment cap not to exceed 900 million in aggregate or 325 million in any given year from 2026 through 2029, with certain exceptions; 
 IPL to retain renewable tax benefits from new generation resources and the repowering of existing wind farms, including the Franklin County wind farm, as well as retain energy margins for new generation resources and battery storage; 
 Discontinuation of the renewable energy rider; and 
 A return of the remaining net book value of the Lansing Generating Station; however, the agreement does not include a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing, resulting in Alliant Energy and IPL recording a pre-tax non-cash charge of 60 million to Asset valuation charge for IPL s Lansing Generating Station in their income statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In August 2024, the PSCW issued an order authorizing WPL to refund 34 million, plus interest, to its retail electric customers in the fourth quarter of 2024 for fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2023 that were lower than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period. 
 Refer to Note 3 for discussion of the PSCW s September 2024 order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. 
 WPL currently expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review with the PSCW in the second quarter of 2025 for the 2026/2027 forward-looking Test Period. The key drivers for the anticipated filing include revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric and gas rate base. Any rate changes granted from this pending request are expected to be effective on January 1, 2026, with a decision from the PSCW expected by the end of 2025. 
 
 Growing Customer Demand: 
 Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are pursuing opportunities for customer growth, including new customers at Alliant Energy s development-ready sites in Iowa and Wisconsin. Alliant Energy has entered into electric service agreements with two new customers, who currently expect to build data centers at the Big Cedar Industrial Center Mega-site in Cedar Rapids, Iowa . The electric service agreements are subject to IUC approval under the individual customer rate tariff, which was included in the IUC s September 2024 order for IPL s retail electric rate review. The timing and amount of increases in load are subject to various factors, including interconnections, and any executed or future agreements with customers are not expected to result in immediate increases in load. 
 
 Environmental Matters: 
 In May 2024, the EPA enacted the revised CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of regulation to include coal ash ponds at sites that no longer produce electricity and inactive landfills, including some IPL and WPL facilities. As a result, as discussed in Note 11 , Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recorded additional AROs in the second quarter of 2024. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to evaluate the revised CCR Rule and are unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these updates, including resolution of ongoing litigation. 
 In May 2024, the EPA enacted the final Section 111(d) rule for certain fossil-fueled EGUs and repealed the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The final Section 111(d) rule requires states to implement plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through various Best System of Emission Reduction measures at affected sources, including retirement, enforceable limits on operational capacity, co-firing with low-greenhouse gases fuels, or carbon capture and storage technology. State plans are subject to EPA approval, and must be submitted by May 2026. The final rule s compliance requirements will be phased in beginning in 2030 and covers fossil-fueled EGUs that utilize steam boilers to generate electricity, including IPL s coal-fired Ottumwa Generating Station, George Neal Generating Station, Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 3 and Louisa Generating Station, WPL s coal-fired Edgewater Generating Station Unit 5 (WPL currently plans to convert Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals), and IPL s natural gas-fired Burlington Generating Station and Prairie Creek Generating Station Unit 4. The final rule does not apply to EGUs that are retired by January 2032 and is not currently expected to impact WPL s coal-fired Columbia Energy Center given current plans to retire this EGU prior to the deadline. In addition, the final rule does not impact existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines, including IPL s Marshalltown Generating Station and Emery Generating Station, and WPL s Riverside Energy Center and West Riverside Energy Center; however, these EGUs could be subject to future Section 111(d) rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing combustion turbines. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these matters, including resolution of ongoing litigation. 
 In May 2024, the EPA enacted final revised standards under Section 111(b), which establishes carbon dioxide emissions limits from certain new and reconstructed fossil-fueled EGU combustion turbines that commenced operation after May 23, 2023 with a capacity greater than 25 MW. The final revised standards do not apply to IPL s Marshalltown Generating Station or WPL s West Riverside Energy Center, which commenced operation prior to the applicability date of the final revised standards. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the future outcome or impact of these revised standards, including resolution of ongoing litigation. 
 In May 2024, the EPA enacted a final rule that revises discharge limits for specific categories of wastewater from existing coal-fired EGUs. The new limitations will be implemented in each facility s wastewater discharge permits issued by state agencies and become effective as soon as possible but no later than December 31, 2029. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the final rule and are unable to predict with certainty future compliance impacts, including resolution of ongoing litigation; however, costs to comply with this rule could have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations.

 Alliant Energy s current voluntary environmental-related goals include the following: 
 By 2030, reduce greenhouse gases emissions from its utility operations by 50 from 2005 levels, reduce its electric utility water supply by 75 from 2005 levels and electrify 100 of its owned light-duty fleet vehicles. 
 By 2040, eliminate all coal-fired EGUs from its generating fleet. 
 By 2050, aspire to achieve net-zero greenhouse gases emissions from its utility operations. 
 
 Legislative Matters: 
 In May 2024, the Major Economic Growth Attraction program was enacted in Iowa, which offers various tax incentives for up to two qualified businesses for c ertain large-scale projects with capital investments greater than 1 billion constructed on certified sites greater than 250 acres in Iowa. The most significant provision of this program for Alliant Energy encourages economic development in IPL s service territory. Alliant Energy has various development-ready sites throughout Iowa, including the Big Cedar Industrial Center Mega-site in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and the Prairie View Industrial Center Super Park in Ames, Iowa. 
 In May 2024, legislation was enacted in Iowa related to the advance rate-making principles for certain investments in Iowa. The most significant provisions of this legislation for Alliant Energy would allow IPL to include electric storage and nuclear-fired generation projects in the advance rate-making principles request process prior to making these investments in Iowa, and require IPL to obtain a certificate of public convenience, use and necessity (GCU Certificate) from the IUC in order to construct electric storage projects. 
 
 Financings and Common Stock Dividends: 
 Refer to Results of Operations for discussion of expected future issuances of common stock and common stock dividends, and expected future issuances and retirements of long-term debt in 2025. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Financial Results Overview - The table below includes EPS for Utilities and Corporate Services, ATC Holdings, and Non-utility and Parent, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy s net income and EPS attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for the three months ended September 30 were as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 
 2024 2023 Income (Loss) EPS Income (Loss) EPS Utilities and Corporate Services 308 1.20 281 1.11 ATC Holdings 9 0.04 9 0.03 Non-utility and Parent (22) (0.09) (31) (0.12) Alliant Energy Consolidated 295 1.15 259 1.02 
 
 Alliant Energy s Utilities and Corporate Services net income increased by 27 million for the three-month period, primarily due to higher revenue requirements from WPL s capital investments and the timing of income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher financing and depreciation expenses, and estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales. 
 
 Alliant Energy s Non-utility and Parent net income increased 9 million for the three-month period, primarily due to charges related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to Iowa corporate income tax rate changes recorded in the third quarter of 2023.

 Electric Sales for Resale - Bulk Power and Other - Bulk power and other volume changes were due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by MISO. These changes are impacted by several factors, including the availability and dispatch of Alliant Energy s EGUs and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets. Changes in bulk power and other revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating income. 
 
 Gas Transportation/Other - Gas transportation/other sales volume changes were largely due to changes in the gas volumes supplied to Alliant Energy s natural gas-fired EGUs caused by the availability and dispatch of such EGUs. 
 
 Electric Utility Revenue Variances - The following items contributed to increased (decreased) electric utility revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 (in millions): 
 Three Months Nine Months Alliant Energy IPL WPL Alliant Energy IPL WPL Higher revenue requirements at WPL (a) 44 44 118 118 Higher (lower) sales for resale bulk power and other revenues 6 (3) 9 4 (17) 21 Lower revenues due to changes in retail electric fuel-related costs (Refer to Electric Production Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses Variances below) (a)

 (a) In December 2023, the PSCW issued an order authorizing an annual base rate increase of 49 million for WPL s retail electric customers, covering the 2024 forward-looking Test Period, which reflects revenue requirement impacts of increasing electric rate base and lower forecasted fuel-related expenses. 
 (b) WPL s cost recovery mechanism for retail fuel-related expenses supports deferrals of amounts that fall outside an approved fuel monitoring range of forecasted fuel-related expenses determined by the PSCW each year. The difference between revenue collected and actual fuel-related expenses incurred within the fuel monitoring range increases or decreases Alliant Energy s and WPL s electric utility revenues. WPL estimates the increase (decrease) to electric utility revenues from amounts within the fuel monitoring range were approximately 0 and 4) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2 million and 5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Other Future Considerations - In addition to items discussed in this report, the following key items could impact Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s future financial condition or results of operations: 
 Financing Plans - Alliant Energy currently expects to issue up to 25 million of common stock in 2025 through its Shareowner Direct Plan. In 2025, IPL currently expects to issue up to 600 million of long-term debt, and AEF and/or Alliant Energy at the parent company level expect to issue up to 600 million of long-term debt in aggregate. IPL and AEF each have 300 million of long-term debt maturing in 2025. 
 Common Stock Dividends - Alliant Energy announced a 6 increase in its targeted 2025 annual common stock dividend to 2.03 per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of 0.5075 per share, beginning with the February 2025 dividend payment. The timing and amount of future dividends is subject to approval of quarterly dividend declarations from Alliant Energy s Board of Directors, and is dependent upon earnings expectations, capital requirements, and general financial business conditions, among other factors. 
 Restructuring and Voluntary Employee Separation Charges - In the fourth quarter of 2024, Alliant Energy announced restructuring activities, including offering certain employees a voluntary separation package to help align resources with evolving business and customer needs, and reduce customer costs. Approximately 5 of Alliant Energy employees accepted the package, and as a result of the announced restructuring activities, Alliant Energy currently expects to record pre-tax charges of 25 million to 30 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Cash Flows From Operating Activities - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in future cash flows from operating activities resulting from the transfer of future renewable tax credits to other corporate taxpayers pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In addition, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in future cash flows from operating activities resulting from higher earnings on increasing rate base at IPL and WPL. 
 Higher Earnings on Increasing Rate Base - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect increases in electric utility and gas utility revenues in 2025 compared to 2024 due to impacts from increasing revenue requirements related to investments in the utility business. In addition, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect a decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2025 compared to 2024 due to additional renewable tax credits from renewable generation and battery storage projects placed in service in 2024 and expected to be placed in service in 2025. A majority of the differences between actual renewable tax credits and renewable tax credits used to determine rates are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. Investment tax credits resulting from IPL battery storage projects expected to be placed in service in 2025 may be utilized to offset any revenue deficiency on an annual basis up to the earnings sharing mechanism threshold included in IPL s retail electric rate review settlement agreement discussed in 2024 Highlights . 
 Sales Trends and Temperatures - In July 2025, IPL s wholesale power agreement with Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative (SMEC) will expire (sales to SMEC represented approximately 5 of IPL s total electric sales in 2023), which is not expected to have a material impact on Alliant Energy s or IPL s future financial condition and results of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, warmer than normal temperatures in the winter and cooler than normal temperatures in the summer in Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s service territories resulted in lower retail electric and gas sales volumes and operating income. 
 Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect a decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses in 2025 compared to 2024 largely due to the asset valuation charge for IPL s Lansing Generating Station and ARO charge for steam assets at IPL recorded in 2024, and the charges expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 and expected future costs savings related to Alliant Energy s restructuring activities. These items are expected to be partially offset by higher generation maintenance and energy delivery expenses. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2025 compared to 2024 due to capital projects placed in service in 2024 and 2025. 
 Interest Expense - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect an increase in interest expense in 2025 compared to 2024 due to financings completed in 2024 and planned in 2025 as discussed above.

Table of Contents 

 Construction and Acquisition Expenditures - Construction and acquisition expenditures and financing plans are reviewed, approved and updated as part of the strategic planning process. Changes may result from a number of reasons, including regulatory requirements, changing legislation, not obtaining favorable and acceptable regulatory approval on certain projects, changing costs of projects due to market conditions, changes in expected load growth, improvements in technology, and improvements to ensure resiliency and reliability of the electric and gas distribution systems. Refer to 2024 Highlights for discussion of an electric distribution system investment cap included in IPL s rate review settlement agreement, which was approved by the IUC in September 2024. Construction and acquisition expenditures for 2024 through 2028 are currently anticipated as follows (in millions), which are focused on transitioning to cleaner sources of energy, adding generation to meet growing customer demand for electricity, and strengthening the resiliency and reliability of the electric grid, and include renewable generation and battery storage projects, dispatchable gas generation projects, converting certain coal-fired EGUs to natural gas, and wind repowering projects. Cost estimates represent Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s portion of construction expenditures and exclude allowance for funds used during construction and capitalized interest, if applicable.

 OTHER MATTERS 

Critical Accounting Estimates - The summary of critical accounting estimates included in the 2023 Form 10-K has not changed materially, except as described below. 
 
 Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities - In May 2023, IPL retired the Lansing Generating Station. IPL was previously allowed a full recovery of and a full return on this EGU from both its retail and wholesale customers. In September 2024, the IUC approved IPL s June 2024 settlement agreement with certain stakeholders for IPL s retail electric rate review for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. The agreement includes a return of the remaining net book value of Lansing; however, the agreement does not include a return on the remaining net book value of Lansing, therefore the return on the remaining net book value is no longer recoverable from IPL s retail electric customers. As a result, a pre-tax non-cash charge of 60 million was recorded to Asset valuation charge for IPL s Lansing Generating Station in Alliant Energy s and IPL s income statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with a corresponding decrease in Alliant Energy s and IPL s assets retired early regulatory assets. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets - 
 Regulated Operations - 
 Generating Units Subject to Early Retirement - In May 2024, WPL announced updated plans to convert the coal-fired Edgewater Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL previously planned to retire the EGU by June 1, 2025. As a result, Alliant Energy and WPL concluded Edgewater Unit 5 no longer meets the criteria to be considered probable of abandonment as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of Edgewater Unit 5. 
 
 Solar Generation Projects Recently Completed or Under Construction - Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect construction costs associated with WPL s approximately 1,100 MW of new solar generation will exceed the construction cost estimates previously approved by the PSCW by approximately 195 million. In February 2024, the PSCW issued an order approving deferral of the incremental solar generation construction costs. The PSCW s order did not authorize a deferral for the return on such costs. In March 2024, WPL filed for judicial review of the PSCW s retail electric rate review order (2024/2025 forward-looking Test Period) and solar generation construction cost deferral order related to the recovery and deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs in 2024 and 2025. In September 2024, the PSCW issued an order modifying its February 2024 order and approving the deferral of the return on the incremental solar generation construction costs, and in October 2024, WPL withdrew its filing for judicial review. Alliant Energy and WPL concluded that there was not a probable disallowance of anticipated higher rate base amounts as of September 30, 2024 given construction costs were reasonably and prudently incurred. 
 
 In September 2024, the IUC approved IPL s settlement agreement with certain stakeholders for its retail electric rate review for the October 2024 through September 2025 forward-looking Test Period. The settlement agreement allows IPL to recover construction costs associated with its 400 MW of new solar generation, including allowance for funds used during construction and transmission upgrade costs among other costs, above the original cost target of 1,650/kilowatt up to 1,837.5/kilowatt. The costs up to the original cost target of 1,650/kilowatt will earn a return on common equity of 10.25 . The costs between 1,650/kilowatt and 1,837.5/kilowatt will earn a return on common equity that is the same as other assets without advance rate-making principles, without having to establish that such costs were reasonably and prudently incurred. Alliant Energy and IPL currently do not expect these construction costs will exceed 1,837.5/kilowatt. 
 
 AROs - The fair value of a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset is recorded as a liability when an asset is placed in service, when a legal obligation is subsequently identified or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement costs. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions, including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation and discount rates. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. The estimates are subject to change and future updates could have a material impact on Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s financial condition and results of operations. In the second quarter of 2024, substantially due to the enactment of the revised CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of regulation to include coal ash ponds at sites that no longer produce electricity and inactive landfills, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recorded additional AROs of 355 million, 102 million and 253 million, respectively. These amounts are expected to be adjusted in the future as additional information is obtained for the specific site closure plans, including the determination of whether or not individual sites are considered legal obligations and the acceptance and approval of compliance approaches, which could change management assumptions and result in a material change to the recorded ARO amounts. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of AROs.
