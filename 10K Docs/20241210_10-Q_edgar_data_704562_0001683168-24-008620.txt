 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

Process development revenue 

Process development revenue generally represents
revenue from services associated with the custom development of a manufacturing process and analytical methods for a customer s
product. Process development revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method that compares the cost of cumulative work-in-process
to date to the most current estimates for the entire cost of the performance obligation. Under a process development contract, the customer
owns the product details and process, which has no alternative use. These process development projects are customized to each customer
to meet its specifications and typically includes only one performance obligation. Each process represents a distinct service that is
sold separately and has stand-alone value to the customer. The customer also retains control of its product as the product is being created
or enhanced by our services and can make changes to its process or specifications upon request. Under these agreements, we are entitled
to consideration for progress to date that includes an element of profit margin. 

The following table summarizes our revenue streams (in thousands): 

Process development revenues 

Total revenues 

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and
cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, contract assets (unbilled receivables), and contract liabilities (customer deposits
and deferred revenue). Contract assets are recorded when our right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage
of time. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet when our rights become unconditional.
Contract liabilities represent customer deposits and deferred revenue billed and/or received in advance of our fulfillment of performance
obligations. Contract liabilities convert to revenue as we perform our obligations under the contract. 

During the three and six months ended October
31, 2024, we recognized revenues of .0 million and million, respectively, for which the contract liability was recorded in a prior
period. 

During the three and six months ended October
31, 2023, we recognized revenues of .0 million and million, respectively, for which the contract liability was recorded in a prior
period. 

The transaction price for services provided under
our customer contracts reflects our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for providing goods
and services to our customers. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate transaction price to each performance
obligation identified in a contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. For contracts in which we receive noncash consideration,
such as in the form of a customer s equity securities, we utilize the quoted market price for such noncash consideration to determine
the transaction price. We generally determine relative standalone selling prices based on the price observed in the customer contract
for each distinct performance obligation. If observable standalone selling prices are not available, we may estimate the applicable standalone
selling price based on the pricing of other comparable services or on a price that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable
service. 

In determining the transaction price, we also
considered the different sources of variable consideration including, but not limited to, discounts, credits, refunds, price concessions
or other similar items. We have included in the transaction price some or all of an amount of variable consideration, utilizing the most
likely method, only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The actual amount of consideration
ultimately received may differ. 

In addition, our customer contracts generally
include provisions entitling us to a cancellation or postponement fee when a customer cancels or postpones its commitments prior to our
initiation of services, therefore not utilizing their reserved capacity. The determination of such cancellation and postponement fees
are based on the terms stated in the related customer contract but are generally considered substantive for accounting purposes and create
an enforceable right and obligation due to us when the cancellation or postponement occurs. Accordingly, we recognize such fees, subject
to variable consideration, as revenue upon the cancellation or postponement date utilizing the most likely method. 

Management may be required to exercise judgement
in estimating revenue to be recognized. Judgement is required in identifying performance obligations, estimating the transaction price,
estimating the stand-alone selling prices of identified performance obligations, estimating variable consideration, and estimating the
progress towards the satisfaction of performance obligations. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, the estimates will
be adjusted, which will affect revenues in the period that such variances become known. 

There were material adjustments in estimates
for variable consideration for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024. During the three and six months ended October 31, 2023,
changes in estimates for variable consideration resulted in a decrease in revenues of million and million, respectively, which
was attributed to an insolvent customer combined with consideration under a contract where uncertainties had been resolved. 

We apply the practical expedient available under
ASC 606 that permits us not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length
of one year or less. As of October 31, 2024, we do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts greater than one year. 

Costs incurred to obtain a contract are not material.
These costs are generally employee sales commissions, which are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative
expense in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. 

million and million,
respectively, was deemed necessary. 

Laboratory and manufacturing equipment 

Computer equipment and software 

Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 

Costs for property and equipment
not yet placed into service have been capitalized as construction-in-progress. These costs are primarily related to equipment and leasehold
improvements associated with our manufacturing facilities and will be depreciated in accordance with the above guidelines once placed
into service. Interest costs incurred during construction of major capital projects are capitalized as construction-in-progress until
the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the
life of the underlying asset. Interest capitalized as construction-in-progress for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 was
 nil and 
 million, respectively. Interest capitalized as construction-in-progress for the three and six months ended October 31, 2023 was
 million and 
 million, respectively. All of our property and equipment are located in the United States. Property and equipment consist of the

indicators
of impairment of the value of our long-lived assets and no cumulative impairment losses were recognized. 

As of October 31, 2024 and
April 30, 2024, our Level 1 financial assets consisted of our cash equivalents invested in money market funds of 
million and 
million, respectively, and our other current assets related to investments in equity securities of million
and 
million, respectively. Our Level 1 financial assets are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical securities (Level
1 inputs). We did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

We consider the fair value of our convertible
senior notes to be a Level 2 financial liability due to limited trading activity of the convertible senior notes (Note 3, Debt ).
We did not have any other Level 2 or Level 3 financial liabilities as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00 convertible senior notes due 2029 (the 2029
Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. We received net proceeds from the Offering
of approximately million, after deducting placement agent s commissions and other debt issuance related expenses of approximately
 million. 

Subsequent to the closing of the Offering, during
March 2024, we used approximately million of the net proceeds to (i) repurchase for cash, .0 million aggregate principal amount
of the 2026 Notes (as defined below) in privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2026 Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest of million, and (ii) repay in full, the remaining outstanding 2026 Notes balance by depositing the required payoff amount
of million, representing principal and accrued and unpaid interest, with the trustee under the 2026 Notes Indenture (as defined below),
following which no 2026 Notes remained outstanding. 

The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations
and accrue interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning
on September 1, 2024. The 2029 Notes mature on , unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders.
The 2029 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election
in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the indenture (the 2029 Notes Indenture governing the
2029 Notes. 

The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes
is approximately 101.1250 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately
 9.89 per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance
with the terms of the 2029 Notes Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we
will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their 2029 Notes in connection with such
a fundamental change, as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture. 

Holders of the 2029 Notes may convert their 2029
Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, only under
the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2024 (and only during such
fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during
any 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater
than or equal to 130 of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period
after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined in the 2029
Notes Indenture) per 1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the
product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence
of specified corporate events as described in the 2029 Notes Indenture. 

On or after September 1, 2028 until the close
of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders at their option may convert all or any
portion of their 2029 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the 2029 Notes prior to the March
1, 2029 maturity date. 

If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined
in the 2029 Notes Indenture), holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at a fundamental change
repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding
the fundamental change repurchase date. 

The 2029 Notes Indenture includes customary terms
and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, if we fail to comply with any of our other agreements
contained in the 2029 Notes or the 2029 Notes Indenture for 60 days after receipt of written notice of such failure from the trustee or
the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2029 Notes, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25 
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2029 Notes may declare the entire principal of all the 2029 Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest to be immediately due and payable. 

As of October 31, 2024, the conditions allowing
holders of the 2029 Notes to convert had not been met and, therefore, the 2029 Notes are classified as a long-term liability on the unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 

In March 2021, we issued million in aggregate
principal amount of 1.25 exchangeable senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds we received from the issuance of 2026 Notes was million,
after deducting initial purchaser discounts and other debt issuance related expenses of million. 

The 2026 Notes were senior unsecured obligations
and accrued interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The 2026
Notes were to mature on , unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders. The 2026
Notes were convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election
in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes (the 2026 Notes Indenture ). 

Subsequent to the closing of the Offering described
above, during March 2024, we repurchased and paid off the remaining balance of the 2026 Notes.

The net carrying amount of the 2029 Notes is
as follows (in thousands): 

Unamortized issuance costs

the 2029 Notes for the period ended October 31, 2024 (Level 2). 

The following table summarizes the components

Revolving Credit Facility 

In March 2023, we entered into a credit agreement
with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and letter of credit issuer, which was subsequently amended on October 27, 2023 and
March 12, 2024 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility (the Revolving
Credit Facility in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 50 million and (ii) a borrowing base calculated as the sum of (a) 80 
of the value of certain of our eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) up to 100 of the value of eligible cash collateral. In addition,
we paid a quarterly unused revolving line facility fee of 0.25 per annum on the average unused facility. 

The Revolving Credit Facility matured on October
25, 2024, without us drawing upon the facility throughout its term. 

Certain of our operating facility leases require
us to pay property taxes, insurance and common area maintenance. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities,
they are recognized as variable lease cost in the period they are incurred. 

We also lease certain manufacturing equipment

certain predetermined financial metrics for each such Performance Period. Depending on the actual financial metrics achieved relative
to the target financial metrics for such Performance Periods, the number of PSUs issued could range from 0 to 200 of the target amount.
The number of granted shares included in the table below is based on a maximum 200 achievement of each financial metric during each Performance
Period (the Maximum Performance Target ). If a financial metric is achieved at a rate below the Maximum Performance Target,
or is not achieved, the corresponding portions of the PSUs that do not vest are forfeited.

Performance and Financial Measures 

In assessing the performance of our business,
we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of
our business are revenues, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income (loss), interest expense, other
income (expense), net, and income tax (benefit) expense. 

We intend for this discussion to provide the reader
with information that will assist in understanding our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key
items in those unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for
those changes. 

Revenues 

Revenues are derived from services provided under
our customer contracts and are disaggregated into manufacturing and process development revenue streams. Manufacturing revenue generally
represents revenue from the manufacturing of customer products derived from mammalian cell culture covering clinical through commercial
manufacturing runs. Process development revenue generally represents revenue from services associated with the custom development of a
manufacturing process and analytical methods for a customer s product. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit is equal to revenues less cost of
revenues. Cost of revenues reflects the direct cost of labor, overhead and material costs. Direct labor costs include compensation, benefits,
recruiting fees, and stock-based compensation within the manufacturing, process and analytical development, quality assurance, quality
control, validation, supply chain and facilities functions. Overhead costs primarily include the rent, common area maintenance, utilities,
property taxes, security, materials and supplies, software, small equipment and deprecation costs incurred at our manufacturing and laboratory
locations. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses are composed of corporate-level expenses, including compensation, benefits, recruiting fees and stock-based compensation of corporate
functions such as executive management, finance and accounting, business development, legal, human resources, information technology,
and other centralized services. SG A expenses also include corporate legal fees, audit and accounting fees, investor relations expenses,
non-employee director fees, corporate facility related expenses, and other expenses relating to our general management, administration,
and business development activities. 

22 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense consists of interest costs related
to our outstanding convertible senior notes, revolving credit facility and finance leases, including amortization of debt issuance costs. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other income (expense), net primarily consists
of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, net of gains (losses) from the disposal of long-lived assets, and unrealized loss
from an investment in equity securities. 

Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Expense 

We are subject to taxation in the United States
and various state jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We prepare our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the
income tax accounting rules and each jurisdiction s enacted tax laws and regulations. For additional information refer to Note 7,
 Income Taxes , of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Revenues 

Revenues
for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were 33.5 million compared to 25.4 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase
of approximately 8.1 million, or 32 . The net increase in revenues can be attributed to the following revenue streams (in thousands):

Gross Loss 

Gross loss for the three months
ended October 31, 2024 was 2.0 million (negative 6 gross margin) compared to a gross loss of 4.7 million (negative 18 gross margin)
for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross loss during the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to
the same prior year period was primarily driven by increased revenues, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit related
expenses, facility, manufacturing and other related expenses, and depreciation expense. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A expenses were 10.6
million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 6.6 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of 4.0
million, or 61 . The net increase in SG A expenses can be attributed to the following components: 

millions 
 
 Increase in compensation and benefit related expenses 
 2.1 
 
 Increase in legal fees 
 1.9 
 
 Total increase in SG A expenses 
 4.0 

Operating Loss 

Operating loss was 12.6 million for the three
months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 11.2 million for the same period in the prior year. This 1.4 million increase in year-over-year
operating loss can be attributed to the 4.0 million increase in SG A expenses, offset by the 2.6 million decrease in gross loss. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 3.3 million for the three
months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase of approximately 2.4 million
can primarily be attributed to 3.1 million of increased interest expense associated with our 2029 Notes (as defined below), partially
offset by a 0.7 million decrease in interest expense associated with our 2026 Notes, which were paid off during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2024. 

Other Income (Expense), net 

Other income (expense), net OI E was expense of 1.5 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to income of 0.1 million for the same period in the
prior year. This 1.6 million decrease in year-over-year OI E can primarily be attributed to a 1.8 million unrealized loss from an
investment in an equity security, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in interest income. 

Income Tax (Benefit) 

We recorded no income tax (benefit) expense for
the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to income tax (benefit) of 2.4 million for the same prior year period. This decrease
in our income tax provision can primarily be attributed to the recording of a valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2024 to offset our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate for the current year period was approximately 0 and was computed based
on the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 adjusted primarily for the tax impact of stock-based compensation, non-deductible officers 
compensation, transportation fringe benefits, and valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate for the same prior year period was approximately
20 and was computed based on the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 adjusted primarily for the tax impact of stock-based compensation,
non-deductible officers compensation, and transportation fringe benefits.

for the six months ended October 31, 2024 were 73.7 million compared to 63.1 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase
of approximately 10.5 million, or 17 . The net increase in revenues can be attributed to the following revenue streams (in thousands):

Gross Profit (Loss) 

Gross profit for the six months
ended October 31, 2024 was 3.7 million (5 gross margin) compared to a gross loss of 0.6 million (negative 1 gross margin) for the
same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit during the six months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the same
prior year period was primarily driven by increased revenues, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit related expenses,
facility, manufacturing and other related expenses, and depreciation expense. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A expenses were 18.8
million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 12.8 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of 5.9
million, or 46 . The net increase in SG A expenses can be attributed to the following components:

Operating Loss 

Operating loss was 15.1 million for the six months
ended October 31, 2024 compared to 13.4 million for the same period in the prior year. This 1.7 million increase in year-over-year operating
loss can be attributed to the 5.9 million increase in SG A expenses, partially offset by the 4.2 million increase in gross profit. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 5.7 million for the six
months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the same period in the prior year. This increase of approximately 4.1 million
can primarily be attributed to 5.3 million of increased interest expense associated with our 2029 Notes (as defined below), partially
offset by a 1.4 million decrease in interest expense associated with our 2026 Notes, which were paid off during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2024. 

Other Income (Expense), net 

Other income (expense), net OI E was expense of 2.1 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to income of 0.4 million for the same period in the prior
year. This 2.5 million decrease in year-over-year OI E can primarily be attributed to a 2.7 million unrealized loss from an investment
in an equity security, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in interest income. 

Income Tax (Benefit) 

We recorded no income tax (benefit) expense for
the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to income tax (benefit) of 3.0 million for the same prior year period. This decrease in
our income tax provision can primarily be attributed to the recording of a valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024
to offset our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate for the current year period was approximately 0 and was computed based on the
U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 adjusted primarily for the tax impact of stock-based compensation, non-deductible officers compensation,
transportation fringe benefits, and valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate for the same prior year period was approximately 21 and
was computed based on the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 adjusted primarily for the tax impact of stock-based compensation, non-deductible
officers compensation, and transportation fringe benefits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following discussion assumes that the Merger
is not consummated, and we continue to operate as an independent company. During the pendency of the Merger, we are prohibited from raising
capital through equity or debt financing and are subject to other restrictions that generally prohibit transactions and operations outside
the ordinary course. 

Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing
cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of October 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 33.4 million. We believe that our existing
cash and cash equivalents on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for
at least the next 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. 

We expect our short-term (the
next 12 months) operations and capital requirements will be supported by our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows
from operations. If our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand and our actual or anticipated cash flows from operations are not sufficient
to support our operations or capital requirements, either in the near-term (the next 12 months) or the long-term (beyond the next 12 months),
then we may seek to access capital through borrowing arrangements and/or through the public or private offering of our equity or debt
securities. We may raise these funds at the appropriate time, accessing the form of capital that we determine is most appropriate considering
the markets available to us and their respective costs of capital. These financings may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.
Our ability to raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to,
the market demand for our common stock. The market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
including, but not limited to, our financial results, economic and market conditions, and global financial crises and economic downturns,
which may cause extreme volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets. In addition, even if we are able to raise additional
capital, it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us, or it may contain restrictions on the operations of our business.

from the Offering of approximately 153.5 million, after deducting placement agent s commissions and other debt issuance related
expenses of approximately 6.5 million. 

The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations
and accrue interest at a rate of 7.00 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning
on September 1, 2024. The 2029 Notes mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders.
The 2029 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election
in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the indenture governing the 2029 Notes. 

We may not redeem the 2029 Notes prior to the
March 1, 2029 maturity date. For additional information regarding the 2029 Notes, see Note 3, Debt , of the notes
to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Leases 

We lease certain office, manufacturing, laboratory,
and warehouse space located in Orange County, California under operating lease agreements. Our leased facilities have original lease terms
ranging from 7 to 12 years, contain multi-year renewal options, and scheduled rent increases of 3 on either an annual or biennial basis.
We also lease certain manufacturing equipment under finance lease agreements that have lease terms of up to 5 years. As of October 31,
2024, we had outstanding lease payment obligations of approximately 79.3 million, of which 3.0 million is payable in the remainder of
fiscal 2025, 11.2 million is payable in fiscal 2026, 4.6 million is payable in fiscal 2027, 4.0 million is payable in fiscal 2028,
 4.1 million is payable in fiscal 2029, and 52.3 million is payable thereafter. 

Capital Expenditures 

Assuming that the Merger is not consummated,
and we continue to operate as an independent company, we currently anticipate that cash required for capital expenditures during
fiscal 2025 will be approximately 5 million to 7 million, which includes accrued and unpaid capital expenditures of
approximately 0.2 million as of October 31, 2024. 

Merger Agreement 

On November 6, 2024, we entered into the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants by us regarding the conduct of our business prior to the closing of the Merger.
In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to take, authorize, agree or commit
to do certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business, including incurring indebtedness (other than to replace existing indebtedness)
or materially amending the terms of existing indebtedness. We do not believe that the restrictions in the Merger Agreement will prevent
us from meeting our debt obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs or capital expenditure requirements. 

The Merger Agreement contains customary termination
rights for each of us and Parent. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, under specified circumstances,
we will be required to pay Parent a termination fee, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to (i) us accepting a Superior
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that was not the result of a material breach of our no-shop obligations under the Merger
Agreement; or (ii) our Board changing its recommendation that our stockholders vote in favor of the Merger, in which case the termination
fee payable by us to Parent will be 32.0 million. The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent will be required to pay us a termination
fee of 64.0 million in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, including if the Merger
Agreement is terminated by us following (i) Parent s failure to consummate the Merger as required pursuant to, and in the circumstances
specified in, the Merger Agreement; or (ii) Parent or Merger Sub s breach of their representations, warranties or covenants (including
Parent s financing obligations) in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied. The Merger Agreement
further provides that Parent will be required to pay us a termination fee of 32.0 million in the event that the Merger Agreement is validly
terminated after January 31, 2025 following Parent s, or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Merger Agreement), acquisition
or agreement to acquire, or public announcement of the intent to acquire, any assets, business, division or any person that is a material,
direct competitor of ours, and such acquisition is a proximate cause of the failure of the parties to receive any consents or approvals
necessary in connection with the Merger under applicable antitrust laws. 

In addition to the foregoing termination rights,
and subject to certain limitations, we or Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by May 6, 2025, subject
to an automatic extension to November 6, 2025 if the Transactions have not been consummated, but the only closing condition that has not
been satisfied or waived (other than those that are to be satisfied at the closing of the Transactions, each of which is capable of being
satisfied) is the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates	 

Our discussion and analysis
of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of
our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what
we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. During the six months ended October
31, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as previously disclosed by us in Part II, Item 7 of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

28 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

For a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements applicable to us, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the accompanying notes
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Backlog 

Our backlog represents, as of
a point in time, expected future revenue from contracted work not yet completed. As of October 31, 2024, our backlog was approximately
 220 million, as compared to approximately 193 million as of April 30, 2024. While we anticipate a significant amount of our backlog
will be recognized as revenue over the next five fiscal quarters, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including
but not limited to: (i) the risk that a customer timely cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of services, in which case we
may be required to refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; (ii) the risk that a customer
may experience delays in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated services; (iii) the risk that
we may not successfully execute on all customer projects; and (iv) the risk that commencement of customer projects may be postponed due
to supply chain delays, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenues and profitability. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

During the six months ended
October 31, 2024, there were no material changes in the market risks described in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

We carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024, the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of October 31, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

There were no significant changes
in our internal control over financial reporting, during the quarter ended October 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

29 

PART II 
OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In the ordinary course of business,
we are at times subject to various legal proceedings and disputes. We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such provisions, if any, are reviewed at least
quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of any settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel,
and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome
of which, in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that
involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, please refer to Part II, Item 1A, of our Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on September 9, 2024, except as follows: 

Risks Related to the Pending Acquisition by
Affiliates of GHO Capital Partners LLP and Ampersand Capital Partners. 

The announcement and pendency of our agreement
to be acquired by affiliates of GHO Capital Partners LLP and Ampersand Capital Partners may have an adverse effect on our business results,
and a failure to complete the merger could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations financial condition,
cash flows, and stock price. 

On November 6, 2024, we entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Space Finco, Inc., a Delaware corporation Parent ), and Space
Mergerco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ), providing for the merger
of Merger Sub with and into us (the Merger , and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
the Transactions ), with us surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed
by affiliates of GHO Capital Partners LLP and Ampersand Capital Partners. 

Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of certain conditions, including, but not limited to (i) our receipt of the approval of our stockholders representing a majority
of the outstanding shares of our common stock; (ii) expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of
the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the HSR Act (iii) absence of any law, order
or injunction issued by any governmental body of competent jurisdiction preventing or making illegal the consummation of the Merger; (iv)
the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to specified materiality qualifiers); (v)
compliance with the covenants and obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; and (vi) absence of a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to us that is continuing as of the effective time of the Merger (the Effective
Time ). There is no assurance that all of the various conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the
proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. 

The Merger may be delayed, and may ultimately
not be completed, due to a number of factors, including: 

the failure to obtain requisite stockholder approval to approve
the Merger; 

the failure to obtain regulatory approvals from various governmental
entities 

potential future stockholder litigation and other legal and regulatory
proceedings and 

the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion
of the merger, including the possibility that a Material Adverse Effect would permit Parent not to close the Merger. 

30 

If the Merger does not close, we may suffer other consequences that
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and stock price, and our stockholders would be
exposed to additional risks, including: 

to the extent that the current market price of our stock reflects
an assumption that the Merger will be completed, the price of our common stock could decrease if the Merger is not completed 

investor confidence in us could decline, stockholder litigation
could be brought against us, relationships with existing and prospective customers and other business partners may be adversely impacted,
we may be unable to retain key personnel, and our operating results and cash flows may be adversely impacted due to costs incurred in
connection with the Merger 

any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement
and pendency of the Merger, including adverse changes in our relationships with employees, customers and other business partners, may
continue or intensify in the event the Merger is not consummated or is significantly delayed and 

the requirement that we pay Parent a termination fee of 32.0
million under certain circumstances that give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement. 

There can be no assurance that our business, relationships with other
parties, liquidity or financial condition will not be adversely affected, as compared to the condition prior to the announcement of the
Merger, if the Merger is not consummated. 

While the Merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual
restrictions that could harm our business relationships, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and business. 

During the period prior to the closing of the
Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, we may be exposed to certain inherent risks and we are subject to restrictions on our
business activities, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material
respects, and subjecting us to a variety of specified restrictions absent Parent s prior consent. These risks and limitations include,
among other things: 

potential uncertainty regarding our future plans and strategy,
including business model changes and transformation 

the possibility of disruption to our business and operations
resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including diversion of management attention and resources 

our inability to attract and retain key personnel and recruit
prospective employees, and the possibility that our current employees could be distracted, and their productivity decline as a result,
due to uncertainty regarding the Merger 

the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or
make changes to our business pending the completion of the Merger, and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business 

our inability to freely issue securities, incur indebtedness
(subject to certain exceptions), or declare or authorize any dividend or distribution without Parent's approval 

our inability to solicit other acquisition proposals during the
pendency of the Merger and 

the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger and
the Transactions, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows. 

These risks and restrictions could prevent us
from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding
effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may, as a result, materially and adversely impact our
business, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock and our perceived
value, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. 

In certain instances, the Merger Agreement
requires us to pay a termination fee to Parent, which could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available
for general corporate purposes. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may
be required to pay Parent a termination fee of 32.0 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described
in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) us accepting a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that
was not the result of a material breach of our no-shop obligations or (ii) our Board changing its recommendation that our stockholders
vote in favor of the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated the circumstances provided in the Merger Agreement, the termination
fee we may be required to pay may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes
and other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business operations
and financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. 

31 

We have incurred, and will continue to incur,
direct and indirect costs as a result of the pending Transactions. 

We have incurred, and will continue to incur,
significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs, in connection with the pending Transactions.
We must pay substantially all of these costs and expenses whether or not the Transactions are completed. 

There are a number of factors beyond our control
that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. 

Litigation may arise in connection with
the Merger, which could be costly, prevent consummation of the Merger, divert management s attention and otherwise materially harm
our business. 

Lawsuits may be filed challenging aspects of the
proposed Merger. Regardless of the outcome of any future litigation related to the Merger, such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive
and may distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business. The litigation costs and diversion of management s
attention and resources to address the claims and counterclaims in any litigation related to the Merger may materially adversely affect
our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, and financial condition. If the Merger is not consummated for any reason,
litigation could be filed in connection with the failure to consummate the Merger. Any litigation related to the Merger may result in
negative publicity or an unfavorable impression of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock, impair our ability
to recruit or retain employees, damage our relationships with our customers and other business partners, or otherwise materially harm
our operations and financial performance.
