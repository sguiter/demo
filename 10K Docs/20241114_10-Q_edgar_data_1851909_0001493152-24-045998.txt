Management
has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement,
although substantially all of the net proceeds are being applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC Nasdaq rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together
have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (less any taxes payable on interest earned on the
Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target
or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

The
Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting
called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the
Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to

the Amended and Restated Charter provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person
with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act

If
a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the
Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Charter, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and
file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior
to completing a Business Combination. 

The
Sponsors have agreed (i) to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in
favor of a Business Combination; (ii) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Charter with respect to the Company s
pre-Business Combination activities prior to the closing of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders

upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from
the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete
its Business Combination. 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 19, 2024, or April 19, 2025 if all four (4) monthly extensions pursuant
to the Second Extension Amendment Proposal (as defined in Note 11) are used (the Combination Period ), the Company will
(i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business
days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal
to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not
previously released to the Company (less taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number
of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including
the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors (the Board
of Directors ), liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims
of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the
assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit . 

The
Sponsors have agreed that they will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the independent
registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which
the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce
the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share
held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value
of the Trust Account assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective
target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable)
nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company
has not asked the Sponsors to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsors
have sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsors only assets are securities of the Company.
Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsors would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s
officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective
target businesses. The Company seeks to reduce the possibility that the Sponsors will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims
of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities, with which the Company
does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the
Trust Account.

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank accounts and a working capital deficit of . 

To
date, the Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied through (i) a payment of from the Legacy Sponsor to cover certain
expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares, (ii) a loan of approximately from the
Legacy Sponsor pursuant to a promissory note for up to (the IPO Promissory Note ), (iii) the net proceeds from
the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account, (iv) the Polar Capital Investment (as defined in Note 5) and
(v) the Legacy Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). The Company fully repaid the IPO Promissory Note on October 19, 2021. No
additional borrowing is available under the IPO Promissory Note (see Note 5). Also, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had drawn 
from the Polar Capital Investment that was fair valued at and had outstanding from the Legacy Working Capital Loans
(see Note 5). 

Based
on the foregoing, Management believes that the Company may not have sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated obligations through
the earlier of the consummation of an initial Business Combination or one year from the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements. Over this period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, operating costs,
identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses,
paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating
the Business Combination. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40 Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern, the Company has until December 19, 2024, or April 19, 2025 if all four (4) monthly
extensions pursuant to the Second Extension Amendment Proposal are used, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the
Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time and the Company lacks the financial resources it needs to sustain
operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements. If a Business Combination is not consummated with the Combination Period, there will be a mandatory liquidation
and subsequent dissolution of the Company. The Company cannot provide any assurance that (i) new financing will be available to it on
commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or (ii) that its plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. Management
has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent
dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the Company s inability to continue as a going concern.

July 15, 2024. This estimate considers factors such as the probability of consummation of the Business Combination, estimated concessions,

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsors, affiliates of the Sponsors, or the Company s

Warrants to purchase one share of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the principal amount of the WCL Promissory Note so converted divided

option embedded in its Legacy Working Capital Loans should be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative in accordance with ASC 815.
However, the exercise price of the underlying WCL Warrants was greater than the closing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares as of December
31, 2023, and when the Legacy Working Capital Loans were drawn on. The Company believes that the likelihood of GCG s exercise of
the option to convert to WCL Warrants is de minimis. As a result, the Company recorded zero liability related to the conversion option
on the Legacy Working Capital Loans.

Upon

in the initial valuation. On December 9, 2021, the Public Warrants surpassed the 52-day threshold waiting period to be publicly traded
in accordance with the IPO Registration Statement. Once publicly traded, the observable input qualifies the liability for treatment as
a Level 1 liability. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 1 measurement to a Level 2 measurement
due to lack of trading activity as of December 31, 2023. The Public Warrants had a significant trading volume during the quarter ended
September 30, 2024 and were transferred from a Level 2 measurement to a Level 1 measurement. As the transfer of Private Placement Warrants

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements under this Item
regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking
statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, 
 intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our Management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs of our Management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our Management.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed
in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 8, 2021, formed for the purpose of effectuating a Business Combination.
We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging
growth companies. 

We
will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate
non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement. 

We
completed our Initial Public Offering of 20,000,000 Units, each Unit consisting of one Public Share and one-third of one Public Warrant,
at 10.00 per Unit on October 19, 2021. 

Certain
Institutional Anchor Investors that are not affiliated with us, the Legacy Sponsor, our directors, officers, or any member of our Management
purchased an aggregate of 20,000,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of
 200 million. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 4,666,667 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.50
per Private Placement Warrant to our Legacy Sponsor in the Private Placement, generating gross proceeds of 7 million. Concurrently with
the closing of the Private Placement, the Institutional Anchor Investors paid the Legacy Sponsor 280,000 for the transfer of an aggregate
of 186,667 Private Placement Warrants, which transfer will take place upon the closing of the initial Business Combination. 

The
Institutional Anchor Investors also purchased equity interests of the Legacy Sponsor equivalent to 1,547,727 Founder Shares from the
Legacy Sponsor at the original purchase price of 0.004 per share. Following the approval of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal at
the 2023 EGM, the Founder Shares may be converted into Class A Ordinary Shares at any time at the election of a holder of Founder Shares
or at the time of our initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided in the Amended and Restated
Charter. 

30 

Following
the closing of our Initial Public Offering on October 19, 2021, an amount of 200,000,000 10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of
the sale of the Units in our Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account located in the United
States and shall be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations,
as determined by us. On October 19, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead
to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at Citibank, N.A., with Continental continuing to
act as trustee, until the earlier of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following
the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are
no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

The
underwriters of the Initial Public Offering notified us of their intention to partially exercise the Over-Allotment Option on November
30, 2021. As such, on November 30, 2021, we consummated the sale of an additional (i) 1,240,488 Over-Allotment Units, at 10.00 per Over-Allotment
Unit, and (ii) 165,398 Private Placement Warrants, at 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of 12,404,880
and 248,097, respectively. The underwriters forfeited the balance of the Over-Allotment Option. A total of 12,404,880 of the net proceeds
was deposited into the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds deposited into the Trust Account in connection with our Initial
Public Offering to 212,404,880. We incurred additional offering costs of 682,268 in connection with the Over-Allotment Option (of which
 434,171 was for deferred underwriting fees). On August 11, 2023 and August 14, 2023, the underwriters informed us of their decision
to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account. 

Our
Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale
of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. Nasdaq rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have
a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the balance in the Trust Account (less any taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust
Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. We will only complete a Business Combination
if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

We
will provide the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a
Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means
of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, we may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at
a meeting called for such purpose at which Public Shareholders may seek to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do
vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. We will proceed with a Business Combination only if we
have net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such closing of a Business Combination and, if we
seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

If
we seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination and do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Amended
and Restated Charter provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person with
whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted
from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the Public Shares without our prior written consent. 

In
connection with such vote, the Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount
then in the Trust Account 11.01 per share as of September 30, 2024, net of taxes paid and payable). There will be no redemption rights
upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to Warrants. These Class A Ordinary Shares have been recorded at a redemption
value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with ASC 480. 

31 

If
a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant
to our Amended and Restated Charter, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents
containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

Each
of our Sponsors has agreed (i) to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering
in favor of a Business Combination; (ii) not to propose an amendment to our Amended and Restated Charter with respect to our pre-Business
Combination activities prior to the closing of a Business Combination unless we provide dissenting Public Shareholders with the opportunity
to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (iii) not to redeem any Ordinary Shares (including the Founder
Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination
(or to sell any Ordinary Shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if we do not seek shareholder approval in
connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of our Amended and Restated Charter relating to shareholders rights of
pre-Business Combination activity; and (iv) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding
up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account
with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if we fail to complete our Business Combination. 

If
we are unable to complete a Business Combination by December 19, 2024, or April 19, 2025 if all four (4) monthly extensions pursuant
to the Second Extension Amendment Proposal are used, the end of the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the
purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned
on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholder s
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)
as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and our Board of
Directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of our Company, subject in each case to our obligations
under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event of such distribution,
it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than 11.01 per Public Share
(as of September 30, 2024). 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cash of 33,544 and 44,046, respectively, and current liabilities of 5,537,087
and 860,274, respectively. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination.
We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an initial Business Combination will be successful. 

On
January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted the 2024 SPAC Rules, which became effective on July 1, 2024. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other
matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC business combination transactions (ii) additional disclosures relating to
dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and business combination
transactions; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination
transactions and (iv) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for business combination registration
statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject
to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the
SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete
our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.

Sponsor
Handover 

On
August 30, 2023, the Legacy Sponsor and the New Sponsor entered into the Sponsor Purchase Agreement, and on August 31, 2023, the Legacy
Sponsor and the New Sponsor consummated the Sponsor Handover. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Purchase Agreement, at the Sponsor
Handover: (i) the Legacy Sponsor transferred 3,093,036 Founder Shares and 4,645,398 Private Placement Warrants to the New Sponsor; (ii)
New Sponsor agreed to cause us to pay an aggregated amount of 300,000 in cash consideration upon closing of the Business Combination
at the Legacy Sponsor s direction to entities or accounts as directed by the Legacy Sponsor (including the repayment of the 125,000
balance of the note payable to the Legacy Sponsor); (iii) New Sponsor entered into the Registration Rights Agreement Joinder; (iv) the
Legacy Sponsor assigned the Administrative Services Agreement to the New Sponsor; (v) all Prior Directors and Officers resigned, and
Daniel J. Hennessy, Thomas D. Hennessy, Anna Brunelle, Kirk Hovde, Matt Schindel and M. Joseph Beck were appointed as directors and Thomas
D. Hennessy and Nick Geeza were appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, respectively; and (vi) we entered
into the Letter Agreement Amendment with the Legacy Sponsor, the New Sponsor and the Prior Directors and Officers, pursuant to which
the New Sponsor became a party to the Letter Agreement and all Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants transferred to the New Sponsor
remain subject to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Immediately following the Sponsor Handover, the Legacy Sponsor retained 2,217,086
Founder Shares and 186,667 Private Placement Warrants, which Private Placement Warrants will be transferred to the Institutional Anchor
Investors upon the closing of the initial Business Combination. 

On
March 29, 2024, we entered into the Letter Agreement Joinder for 110,000 with each of
our current directors and officers, which is effective as of the Sponsor Handover on August 31, 2023. 

Extension
of Our Combination Period 

We
initially had until October 19, 2023, or 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, to consummate our initial Business
Combination. On October 19, 2023, we held the 2023 EGM, at which our shareholders approved the Charter Amendment Proposals. In connection
with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment Proposals, Public
Shareholders holding 16,045,860 Public Shares (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such
shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result of the 2023 Redemptions, approximately 169.1 million (approximately
 10.54 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. 

Founder
Share Conversion 

On
October 19, 2023, following the approval of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal at the 2023 EGM, we issued an aggregate of 600,000 Class
A Ordinary Shares to the Sponsors upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsors as Founder Shares.
The 600,000 Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the 2023 Founder Share Conversion are subject to the same restrictions
as applied to the Class B Ordinary Shares before the 2023 Founder Share Conversion, including the
Sponsors agreement not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after
the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital share exchange or similar
transaction that results in our shareholders having the right to exchange their Ordinary Shares
 for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last reported sale price of the Class A Ordinary
Shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and
the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Business Combination, the Founder
Shares will be released from the lock-up. 

Recent
Developments 

Between
July 15, 2024 and July 18, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements with the
New Sponsor and unaffiliated third-party investors in exchange for such investors agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 2,475,000 Public
Shares in connection with the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal at the 2024 EGM. In exchange for these commitments
not to redeem the such Public Shares, the New Sponsor agreed to transfer to such investors an aggregate of (i) 412,498 Founder Shares
for the first five (5) months of the extension of the Combination Period from July 19, 2024 to December 19, 2024 and (ii) 82,498 Founder
Shares per month, for each month of the extension of the Combination Period from December 19, 2024 until April 19, 2025, as needed. The
Founder Shares to be transferred to such investors pursuant to the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements are held by the New Sponsor and are
to be transferred in connection with the closing of the Business Combination. In connection with
our entry into the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements, we agreed that, in the event of the liquidation of the Trust Account, we will only
utilize up to 50,000 of funds from the accrued interest of the Trust Account to pay any dissolution expenses if we do not effect a Business
Combination prior to the end of the Combination Period. 

33 

On
July 18, 2024, we held the 2024 EGM to approve, among other things, the Second Extension Amendment Proposal. In connection with the vote
to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, Public Shareholders holding 2,713,143 Public Shares (after giving effect to withdrawals
of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result of
the 2024 Redemptions, approximately 29.6 million (approximately 10.92 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. 

On
July 24, 2024, in connection with the 2024 EGM and the 2024 Redemptions, the Sponsors also converted an aggregate of 2,600,000 Founder
Shares on a one-for-one basis into Class A Ordinary Shares and waived any right to receive funds from the Trust Account with respect
to the Class A Ordinary Shares received upon such conversion and acknowledged that such shares will be subject to all of the restrictions
applicable to the original Founder Shares under the terms of the Letter Agreement. 

On
September 5, 2024, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with the New Sponsor, in the capacity as the representative from
and after the Closing for the shareholders of the Company, (ii) upon execution of a joinder thereto, Pubco, (iii) upon execution of a
joinder thereto, Merger Sub, (iv) EEW, (v) the Sellers, and (vi) E.E.W. Global Holding Limited, in the capacity as the representative
for the Sellers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement. 

Pursuant
to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the Closing, (a) Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity, as a result of which, (i) the Company shall become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, and (ii) each issued and outstanding security of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, in exchange for
the right of the holder thereof to receive a substantially equivalent security of Pubco, and (b) Pubco shall acquire all of the issued
and outstanding ordinary shares of EEW from the Sellers in exchange for Pubco ordinary shares, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (Revised)
of the Cayman Islands and the laws of England and Wales, and any outstanding convertible securities of EEW will be terminated; and (c)
as a result of such Transactions, the Company and EEW each will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, and Pubco will become a publicly
traded company upon the Closing. 

Results
of Operations 

Our
entire activity from inception up to September 30, 2024 relates to our formation, Initial Public Offering, and the search for a target
business with which to consummate an initial Business Combination. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing
and completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income
on cash and cash equivalents or investments from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, which are
partially offset by operating expenses and related party administrative expenses. We incur increased expenses as a result of being a
public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 4,568,210 , consisting
of 4,944,155 loss from operations, all of which were operating expenses, including
 30,000 of administrative expenses with related party, 4,076,270 in non-redemption expense and a change in fair value of derivative
warrant liabilities of 13,103, offset by interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 389,048. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 4,205,940 , consisting
of 5,727,957 loss from operations, all of which were operating expenses, including
 90,000 of administrative expenses with related party, 4,076,270 in non-redemption expense and a change in fair value of derivative
warrant liabilities of 138,182, offset by interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 1,660,199. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 2,009,138, consisting of 594,934 loss from operations, and a loss due
to a change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 850,533 and offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in
the Trust Account of 2,856,382, gain on settlement of professional legal fees of 351,409 and gain on settlement of deferred underwriting
fees of 246,814. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 5,410,558, consisting of 1,246,968 loss from operations, and a loss
due to a change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 1,670,094 and offset by interest earned on marketable securities
held in the Trust Account of 7,729,397, gain on settlement of professional legal fees of 351,409 and gain on settlement of deferred
underwriting fees of 246,814. 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical
instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more
of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete
an initial Business Combination. 

34 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 33,544 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of 5,479,910. To date, our liquidity
needs have been satisfied through (i) a payment of 25,000 from the Legacy Sponsor to cover certain expenses on our behalf in exchange
for the issuance of the Founder Shares, (ii) a loan of approximately 195,000 pursuant to the IPO Promissory Note issued to an affiliate
of the Legacy Sponsor, (iii) the net proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account, (iv) the
Polar Capital Investment and (v) the Legacy Working Capital Loans. We fully repaid the IPO Promissory Note on October 19, 2021. No additional
borrowing is available under the IPO Promissory Note. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsors, affiliates of the Sponsors, or the Prior
Officers and Directors or current directors or officers may, but are not obligated to, provide us the Legacy Working Capital Loans. On
December 30, 2021, we issued the WCL Promissory Note, an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of up to 1,000,000 to GCG,
an affiliate of our Legacy Sponsor. The WCL Promissory Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon consummation of the initial
Business Combination. GCG has the option to convert any unpaid balance of the WCL Promissory Note into WCL Warrants to purchase one share
of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the principal amount of the WCL Promissory Note so converted divided by 1.50. The terms of any such
WCL Warrants will be identical to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have
borrowed an aggregate of 125,000 under the WCL Promissory Note. 

On
September 6, 2023, we entered into the Polar Subscription Agreement with Polar and the New Sponsor, pursuant to which Polar agreed to
make the Polar Capital Investment to us of up to 1,500,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn 1,250,000 under the Polar Capital
Investment that was fair valued at 227,273. For more information on the Polar Subscription Agreement and Polar Capital Investment, see
 Investor Subscription Agreement below. 

On
October 19, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the
Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at Citibank, N.A., with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the
earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments
in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government
securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

Based
on the foregoing, we believe that we may not have sufficient working capital to meet our needs through the consummation of a Business
Combination. Over this period, we will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, operating costs, identifying and evaluating
prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures,
selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update Topic 2014-15, Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we have until December 19, 2024, or April 19,
2025 if all four (4) monthly extensions pursuant to the Second Extension Amendment Proposal are used, to consummate a Business Combination.
It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time and lack the financial resources to sustain operations
for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the unaudited condensed financial statements
included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date,
there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of our Company. We cannot provide any assurance that (i) new financing
will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or (ii) that our plans to consummate an initial Business Combination
will be successful. We have determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation should a Business Combination not occur,
and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed
financial statements and notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. 

35 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation
S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations other than obligations disclosed herein. 

Administrative
Services Agreement 

Commencing
on October 14, 2021, and until completion of our initial Business Combination or liquidation, we may reimburse our Sponsors up to an
aggregate amount of 10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support pursuant to the Administrative
Services Agreement. Per the Administrative Services Agreement, it
is at our option as to whether or not to pay this administrative fee. There was 90,000 and
 70,000 accrued and paid, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Legacy Sponsor assigned the
Administrative Services Agreement with to the New Sponsor on August 31, 2023 in connection with the Sponsor
Handover. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any WCL Warrants (and in each case holders of their underlying securities,
as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement , requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case
of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A Ordinary Shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled
to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back 
registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights
to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred
in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. On August 31, 2023, the New Sponsor executed the Registration Rights
Agreement Joinder in connection with the Sponsor Handover. 

Underwriting
Agreement 

In
connection with the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters were granted the Over-Allotment Option to purchase up to 3,000,000 Over-Allotment
Units, if any. On November 30, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,240,488 Over-Allotment Units pursuant to the partial
exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. The Over-Allotment Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Over-Allotment Unit, generating
aggregate additional gross proceeds of 12,404,880 to us. 

The
underwriters of the Initial Public Offering were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 2.00 of the gross proceeds of the Initial
Public Offering, or 4,000,000 (or 4,600,000 if the Over-Allotment Option was exercised in full). In addition, the underwriters were
entitled to a deferred fee of three and half percent (3.50 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or 7,000,000 (or
 8,050,000 if the Over-Allotment Option was exercised in full). The deferred fees were to become payable to the underwriters from the
amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting
agreement we entered into in connection with the Initial Public Offering. 

On
August 11, 2023 and August 14, 2023, we received formal confirmations from Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC , informing us of their decisions to waive any
entitlement they may have to their deferred underwriting fees payable held in the Trust Account with respect to any Business Combination.
Out of the release of 7,434,171 deferred underwriting fees, 7,187,357 was charged against accumulated deficit in the condensed balance
sheet as of September 30, 2024 included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Financial
Advisory Agreements 

We
entered into two financial advisory agreements in September and December 2022, respectively, with financial advisors in connection with
our Business Combinations. We agreed to pay success fees for signed letters of intent and any successful acquisition. Success fees range
from 50,000 to 1,250,000. We also agreed to reimburse the financial advisors for all reasonable and documented expenses, subject to
limitations and prior written consent of us. Both agreements were terminated in August 2023, and no expense was incurred or outstanding
as of September 30, 2024. 

36 

Investor
Subscription Agreement 

On
September 6, 2023, we entered into the Polar Subscription Agreement with the New Sponsor and Polar, pursuant to which Polar agreed to
fund up to 1,500,000 to us, subject to certain funding milestones. Once we have reached a defined milestone, upon on at least five (5)
calendar days prior written notice, the New Sponsor may require a drawdown against Polar s capital commitment in order to
meet the Sponsor s commitment to us under a drawdown request. As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn 1,250,000 on the Polar Capital
Investment that was fair valued at 227,273 .
The Polar Capital Investment will be repaid to Polar by us upon the closing of an initial Business Combination. Polar may elect to receive
such repayment (i) in cash or (ii) in Class A Ordinary Shares at a rate of one Class A Ordinary Share for each ten dollars of the Polar
Capital Investment. In the event we liquidate without consummating a Business Combination, any amounts remaining in our cash accounts
(excluding the Trust Account) will be paid by us to Polar within five (5) calendar days of the liquidation, and such amounts will be
the sole recourse for Polar. 

Letter
Agreement 

Our
Sponsors, former and current directors and officers have entered into the Letter Agreement with us, pursuant to which, they have waived
their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete
our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if they acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public
Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to
complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

Additionally,
pursuant to the Letter Agreement, our Sponsors, former and current directors and officers will not propose any amendment to our Amended
and Restated Charter (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial Business
Combination or to redeem 100 of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period
or (ii) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity,
unless we provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public
Shares. 

Non-Redemption
Agreements 

Between
October 9, 2023 and October 19, 2023, we entered into the 2023 Non-Redemption Agreements with the New Sponsor and unaffiliated third-party
investors in exchange for such investors agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 4,998,734 Public Shares in connection with the vote to
approve the Charter Amendment Proposals at the 2023 EGM. In exchange for these commitments not to redeem such Public Shares, the New
Sponsor agreed to transfer to such investors an aggregate of 749,810 Founder Shares held by the New Sponsor promptly following the closing
of the Business Combination (but no later than two business days after the satisfaction of the requisite conditions to such transfer). 

We
estimated the aggregate fair value of the 749,810 Class B Ordinary Shares attributable to such investors to be 3, 444,008
 or on a weighted average of 4.59 per share, as of October 19, 2023, which is estimated
by taking into consideration the estimated probability of the consummation of a Business Combination, estimated concessions and estimated
cost of carrying charges to eliminate the investors exposure to changes in the price of their Class B Ordinary Shares. The fair
value of the Class B Ordinary Shares was determined to be an expense in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5T, Accounting
for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s). 

Between
July 15, 2024 and July 18, 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements with the New Sponsor and unaffiliated third-party
investors in exchange for such investors agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 2,475,000 Public Shares in connection with the vote to
approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal at the 2024 EGM. In exchange for these commitments not to redeem such Public Shares,
the New Sponsor agreed to transfer to such investors an aggregate of (i) 412,498 Founder Shares for the first five (5) months of the
extension of the Combination Period from July 19, 2024 to December 19, 2024 and (ii) 82,498 Founder Shares per month, for each month
of the extension of the Combination Period from December 19, 2024 until April 19, 2025, as needed. The Founder Shares to be transferred
to such investors pursuant to the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements are held by the New Sponsor and are to be transferred in connection
with the closing of the Business Combination. In connection with its entry into the 2024 Non-Redemption Agreements, the Company agreed
that, in the event of the liquidation of the Trust Account, it will only utilize up to 50,000 of funds from the accrued interest of
the Trust Account to pay any dissolution expenses if it does not effect a Business Combination prior to the end of the Combination Period. 

The
Company estimated the aggregate fair value of these 742,490 Founder Shares at 4,076,270, or approximately 5.49 per share on a weighted-average
basis as of July 15, 2024. This estimate considers factors such as the probability of consummation of the Business Combination, estimated
concessions, and the cost of carrying charges to mitigate the investors exposure to fluctuations in the price of the Founder Shares.
The fair value of these Founder Shares was determined to be an expense in accordance with SAB 5T and classified as a liability due to
the variability in the number of Founder Shares to be transferred, depending on the timing of the Business Combination. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

This
section is based on our unaudited condensed financial statements and notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial
Statements , which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related
to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events
and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company does not have any critical accounting estimates. 

37 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and it may
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended
transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private
companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company
nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential
differences in accounting standards used. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

Making
estimates requires Management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which Management considered in formulating
its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: 

Net
Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share 

We
comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. We have two classes of Ordinary
Shares: Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares. Income is shared pro rata between the two classes of Ordinary Shares. Net
income per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the respective
period. We did not consider the effect of the Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement
to purchase an aggregate of 1,240,488 Ordinary Shares in the calculation of diluted income per share because their exercise is contingent
upon future events. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption
value approximates fair value. 

38 

Warrant
Liability 

We
account for Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the Warrant s specific
terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the Warrants are freestanding financial
instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the Warrants meet all of the requirements
for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to our own Ordinary Shares, among other conditions
for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of Warrant issuance
and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. 

For
issued or modified Warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the Warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified Warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
the Warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the Warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations of the
unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Class
A Ordinary Shares Subject to Redemption 

We
account for our Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary Shares subject to
mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Ordinary
Shares (including Ordinary Shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption
upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Ordinary
Shares are classified as shareholders deficit. Our Ordinary Shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be
outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption
are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the condensed balance sheets
of the financial statements included in this Report under Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements . 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

We
previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness was related to the
recording of a contingent fee commitment due to a third-party service provider during the period ended December 31, 2022. We remediated
this material weakness through the enhancement of our processes to identify and appropriately apply
applicable accounting requirements. We also utilized the services of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex
accounting applications. This approach helps to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply
to our financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

39 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

To
the knowledge of our Management, there is no material litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or
directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. For
additional risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth below, see the section titled Risk Factors 
contained in our (i) IPO Registration Statement, (ii) 2021 Annual Report, (iii) 2022 Annual Report, (iv) 2023 Annual Report, (v) Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC on May 5, 2022, (vi) Definitive Proxy Statement
on Schedule 14A, as filed with the SEC on June 24, 2024, as supplemented and (vii) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended June 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability
to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from
time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Since
we did not consummate our initial Business Combination within 36 months of the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement, the trading
of our securities on Nasdaq has been suspended and our securities will be delisted from Nasdaq, which may have a material adverse effect
on the trading of our securities and our ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. 

Our
IPO Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 14, 2021 and our securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq
Global Market. Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Charter, we have until December 19, 2024, and then on a monthly basis up to four
(4) times until April 19, 2025 (or such shorter period of time as determined by our Board) to consummate our initial Business Combination.
Nasdaq s rules and guidance currently provide that SPACs (such as us) must satisfy certain listing conditions, including that a
SPAC must complete one or more Business Combinations meeting certain conditions within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial
public offering registration statement (the 36-Month Requirement ). If a SPAC does not meet the 36-Month Requirement, it
will receive a Staff Delisting Determination from Nasdaq which, among other things, informs the SPAC that (i) its securities will be
suspended as of a date certain; (ii) it has a right to request review of the Staff Delisting Determination by a Hearings Panel; and (iii)
a timely request for such review will stay the suspension and delisting action pending the issuance of a written decision of the Hearings
Panel. The Hearings Panel may, where it deems appropriate, grant an exception to the continued listing standards for a period not to
exceed 180 days from the date of the Staff Delisting Determination. The basis for the Staff Delisting Determination may be cured if,
for example, a SPAC completes an initial Business Combination during the period of the stay. 

On
October 15, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq stating that the staff of Nasdaq Staff has determined that: the Company s securities would be delisted from Nasdaq,
trading of the Company s Class A Ordinary Shares, Warrants, and Units would be suspended at the opening of business on October
22, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company s securities from listing and registration
on Nasdaq pursuant to the 36-Month Requirement. Since the Company failed to complete its initial business combination by October 14,
2024, the Company did not comply with the 36-Month Requirement, and its securities were suspended at the opening of business on October
22, 2024 and are now subject to delisting from Nasdaq. 

The
Company remains a reporting entity under the Exchange Act, ensuring continued disclosure of financial and operational information. 

Our
securities are currently quoted on an over-the-counter market and we may face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

our
 ability to complete an initial Business Combination; 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced
 liquidity for our securities; 

a
 determination that our Class A Ordinary Shares is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our Class A
 Ordinary Shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading
 market for our securities; 

a
 limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

40 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

There
were no sales of unregistered securities during the quarterly period covered by the Report. However, on July 24, 2024, we issued an aggregate
of 2,600,000 Class
A Ordinary Shares to the New Sponsor, upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B Ordinary Shares held by the New Sponsor in the
2024 Founder Share Conversion. For more information on the 2024 Founder Share Conversion, see Part I. Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

Use
of Proceeds 

For
a description of the use of proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, see Part II, Item 2 of our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021, as filed with the SEC on November 23, 2021. There has been no
material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the IPO Registration
Statement. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. 

On
October 19, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the
Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at Citibank, N.A., with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the
earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments
in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government
securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 

On
July 18, 2024, we held the 2024 EGM and our shareholders approved, among other things, the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, which
extended the date by which we must consummate a Business Combination from December 19, 2024, or April 19, 2025 if all four (4) monthly
extensions pursuant to the Second Extension Amendment Proposal are used (or such earlier date as determined by the Board). In connection
with the vote to approve the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, Public Shareholders holding 2,713,143 Public Shares properly exercised
their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of 29.6
million, or approximately 10.92 per share, to such redeeming Public Shareholders in the 2024 Redemptions. 

There
were no such repurchases of our equity securities by us or an affiliate during the quarterly period covered by this Report.

ADOPTED PURSUANT TO 

 SECTION
302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 

I,
Thomas D. Hennessy, certify that: 

1. 
 I
 have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Compass Digital Acquisition Corp.; 

2. 
 Based
 on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
 to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
 the period covered by this report; 

3. 
 Based
 on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
 respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
 this report; 

4. 
 The
 registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
 (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
 Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

a) 
 Designed
 such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
 to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
 during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b) 
 Designed
 such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
 supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
 for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

c) 
 Evaluated
 the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
 the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;

d) 
 Disclosed
 in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
