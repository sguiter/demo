The Merger was accounted for using the asset acquisition method in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, PBAX was
considered to be the accounting acquirer based on the terms of the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the cash on hand resulted
in the equity at risk being considered insufficient for Predecessor to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support. Therefore, Predecessor was considered a Variable Interest Entity VIE and the primary beneficiary of Predecessor
was treated as the accounting acquirer. PBAX holds a variable interest in Predecessor and owns of Predecessor s equity.
PBAX was considered the primary beneficiary as it has the decision-making rights that gives it the power to direct the most significant
activities. Also, PBAX retained the obligation to absorb the losses and/or receive the benefits of Predecessor that could have potentially
been significant to Predecessor. The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value was concentrated
in IPR D, an intangible asset. Predecessor s assets (except for cash) and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the
transaction date. Consistent with authoritative guidance on the consolidation of a VIE that is not considered a business, differences
in the total purchase price and fair value of assets and liabilities are recorded as a gain or loss to the condensed consolidated statement
of operations. The loss reflected below on the consolidation of the VIE is reflected on the line (defined below) in the
Company s opening accumulated deficit. 

Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses
are charged to research and development expense as IPR D if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and
has no alternative future use. The IPR D recorded at the Closing of million is reflected on the line in the
Company s opening accumulated deficit. To estimate the value of the acquired IPR D, the Company used the avoided cost method,
which calculates a present value of a return on research and development effort applied to research and development expenditures over
the life of Predecessor. The determination of the fair value requires management to make a significant estimate of the return on research
and development expenditures. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the IPR D. The estimate
of the return on research and development expenditures was based on multiple published studies analyzing actual returns of research and
development expenditures.

million of cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents, with an accumulated deficit of million. Additional funds
are necessary to maintain current operations and to continue R D activities. The Company expects to seek additional funding in
the form of equity financings or debt, however, there can be no assurance that sufficient funding will be available to allow the
Company to successfully continue its R D activities and planned regulatory filings with the FDA. If the Company is unable to
obtain necessary funds, significant reductions in spending and the delay or cancellation of planned activities may be necessary.
These actions would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, and prospects. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date
these financial statements are issued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Risks and uncertainties The Company
is subject to all of the risks inherent in an early-stage biotechnology company. These risks include, but are not limited to, limited
management resources, intense competition, and dependence upon the availability of cash to sustain operations. The Company s operating
results may be materially affected by the foregoing factors. 

The Company s research also requires approvals
from the FDA prior to beginning clinical trials and prior to product commercialization. There can be no assurance that the Company s
current ongoing research and future clinical development will result in the granting of these required approvals. If the Company is denied
such approvals or such approvals are substantially delayed, they could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s future
financial results and cash flows.

(the Conversion Price Floor or of the 5-day volume weighted average price of a share of Common Stock. Trigger events
include customary terms related to exchange listing, registration rights, failure to deliver shares on conversion or exercise of derivative
instruments, or insolvency. Notwithstanding the Conversion Price Floor, if the Conversion Price Floor is greater than of the 5-day

(as defined below) is increased by a multiplier resulting in the convertibility of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock into the number
of shares of Common Stock that would have been issuable if the Alternate Conversion Price had been equal to such lower volume weighted
average price. Such multiplier has been in effect since the registration statement for the resale of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock was declared effective on July 5, 2024 because such effectiveness was after the applicable
deadline therefore and, as a result of such multiplier, such registration statement registered fewer than the maximum number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. 

Redemptions: Upon bankruptcy or liquidation,
Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemed at a premium premium after 180 days after issuance) to the greater of the conversion
amount or the number of shares multiplied by the highest closing price within the preceding 20 days. Additionally, the Company may voluntarily

Purchase of Common Stock by Keystone Capital
Partners under the Equity Line of Credit ELOC 

On February 14, 2024, in conjunction with, and as a condition to the
closing of the Series A PIPE Financing, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Keystone Purchase Agreement with Keystone Capital Partners, L.P. Keystone ), pursuant to which we may sell and issue, and Keystone is obligated to purchase,
up to shares subject to the Company obtaining all necessary stockholder approvals to issue the shares to Keystone. The price
of the shares purchased by Keystone under the ELOC is of various volume-weighted average price VWAP and closing price-based
formulae, and requires a waiver, should the selling price be below per share. As consideration for Keystone s commitment to
purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Keystone Purchase Agreement, we issued an aggregate of shares of Common Stock
to Keystone. 

In the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company sold approximately million shares for gross proceeds of approximately million, and million
shares for gross proceeds of approximately and million, respectively, under the Keystone ELOC. The Company sought and
received a waiver to sell the shares below per share. The Company also issued and shares of common stock

of Common Stock. The price of the shares purchased by Arena under the ELOC is of
various VWAP and closing price-based formulae, and requires a waiver, should the selling price be below per share. As consideration
for Arena commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Arena Purchase Agreement, the Company issued no shares and 
shares of Common Stock to Arena during the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company has sold no
shares of Common Stock to Arena under the Arena ELOC in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Public
Warrants outstanding, each with a right to purchase share of Common Stock for . The Public Warrants became exercisable days
after the Merger. No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering
the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such Common Stock. The warrants were registered
under a resale registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-279156), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission
on July 5, 2024. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, warrant holders
may, during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that
exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public
Warrants will expire after the Merger or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

Once the warrants became exercisable, the Company
may, with days prior notice, redeem the Public Warrants in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant if the shares underlying
the warrants are registered and if the closing price of Common Stock equals or exceeds for of the prior trading days. If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. 

The exercise price and number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary
dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Common
Stock at a price below their respective exercise prices. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the
warrants. 

As discussed above, the Company accounts for warrants
as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments specific terms and applicable
authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Management has concluded that the Public Warrants and Private
Placement Warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment.

shares of Predecessor Series A Preferred Stock at a price of per share. The warrants were exercisable
into shares of Predecessor Series A Preferred Stock at the discretion of the holder, at any time in the after issuance.
The warrants were analyzed and determined to be freestanding instruments issued in a transaction including the conversion or sale of the
Series A Preferred Stock. A warrant to purchase up to shares of Series A Preferred Stock was issued in a transaction that included
the conversion of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock into shares of Predecessor Series A Preferred Stock. Another warrant
to purchase up to shares of Series A Preferred Stock was issued concurrent with the purchase of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock. These warrants are collectively referred to as the Predecessor preferred stock warrants. On February 14,
2024, the Predecessor preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase up to shares of Common Stock Conversion
Warrants ). 

The Conversion Warrants will initially be exercisable
for Common Stock at an exercise price equal to . The exercise price is subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations and
similar events, and, in the event of stock dividends and splits, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the
Conversion Warrant will also be adjusted so that the aggregate exercise price shall be the same immediately before and immediately after
any such adjustment. 

The Conversion Warrants will expire 
after the original Predecessor warrants were issued, or November 14, 2024. The Conversion Warrants will automatically convert at the end
of the exercise period if the fair market value (as determined in the Conversion Warrants) of a share of Common Stock underlying the Conversion
Warrants is greater than the exercise price in effect on such date. 

As discussed above, Predecessor accounts for warrants
as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments specific terms and applicable
authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Based on the exercisability of the Predecessor Preferred Warrants
into Series A Preferred Stock, which had a cash redemption feature outside of the control of Predecessor, the Predecessor warrants were
recorded as a derivative liability and were revalued at each reporting period, with the change in value being recorded on the Statement
of Operations. 

The Company s Conversion Warrants are exercisable
into Common Stock, which has no cash redemption features that require liability treatment and the Company recorded the Conversion Warrants
as equity. 

February 2024 PIPE Common Warrants (Successor) 

The Company s February 2024 PIPE Common
Warrants are initially exercisable for cash at an exercise price equal to the greater of (x) (as adjusted for stock splits, stock

to adjustment for stock splits, combinations and similar events, and, in the event of stock dividends and splits, the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the February 2024 PIPE Common Warrants will also be adjusted so that the aggregate exercise
price shall be the same immediately before and immediately after any such adjustment. On Stockholder approval for the issuance of shares
underlying the warrants, granted April 30, 2024, the exercise price of the February 2024 PIPE Common Warrants was adjusted to per
share, per the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement. 

The February 2024 PIPE Common Warrants will be
exercisable beginning six months after the issuance date (the Initial Exercisability Date and expiring on the third anniversary
of the Initial Exercisability Date. The February 2024 PIPE Common Warrants require buy-in payments to be made by us for
failure to deliver any shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise. 

If at the time of exercise of the February 2024
PIPE Common Warrants, there is no effective registration statement registering the shares of the Common Stock underlying the Common February
2024 PIPE Warrants, such warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis pursuant to their terms.

or issuance or modification of options to a result in the purchase of a Common Share at an effective price per share lower than the
then current September 2024 PIPE Common Warrant exercise price. Additionally, should the Company issue any variable priced convertible
securities, the holders may elect an alternative exercise price that allows exercise at the effective purchase price applicable to the
convertible security. 

The September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants will be
exercisable beginning six months after the issuance date (the Initial Exercisability Date and expiring on the third anniversary
of the Initial Exercisability Date. The September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants require buy-in payments to be made by us for

If at the time of exercise of the September 2024
PIPE Common Warrants, there is no effective registration statement registering the shares of the Common Stock underlying the Common September
2024 PIPE Warrants, such warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis pursuant to their terms. 

If we issue options, convertible securities, warrants,
shares, or similar securities to holders of Common Stock, each holder of September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants has the right to acquire
the same as if the holder had exercised its September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants. The holders of September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants are
entitled to receive any dividends paid or distributions made to our holders of Common Stock on an as if converted basis. 

The September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants prohibit
us from entering into specified fundamental transactions unless the successor entity assumes all of our obligations under the September
2024 PIPE Common Warrants under a written agreement before the transaction is completed. Upon specified corporate events, a holder of
September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants will thereafter have the right to receive upon an exercise such shares, securities, cash, assets or
any other property whatsoever which the holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of the applicable corporate event
had the September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants been exercised immediately prior to the applicable corporate event. When there is a transaction
involving specified changes of control, a holder of September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants will have the right to force us to repurchase
the holder s September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants for a purchase price in cash equal to the Black-Scholes value, as calculated under
the September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants, of the then unexercised portion of the September 2024 PIPE Common Warrants.

. The exercise price is subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations and similar events, and, in the
event of stock dividends and splits, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Preferred Warrant
will also be adjusted so that the aggregate exercise price shall be the same immediately before and immediately after any such adjustment. 

The Preferred Warrants will expire on the first
anniversary of the closing of the Merger, or February 14, 2025. 

We have the right, conditional upon the share price of CERO stock to
be trading above per share, to require the holders of Preferred Warrants to exercise such Preferred Warrants into up to an aggregate
number of shares of Preferred Stock equal to the holder s pro rata amount of shares of Preferred Stock. In connection with
the Series C PIPE Financing, we agreed with certain holders of the Preferred Warrants not to exercise such right to require such exercise
by the holders thereof in consideration for their investment in the Series C PIPE Financing. 

The Preferred Warrants prohibit us from entering
into specified fundamental transactions unless the Successor assumes all of our obligations under the Preferred Warrants under a written
agreement before the transaction is completed. Upon specified corporate events, a holder of the Preferred Warrants will thereafter have
the right to receive upon an exercise such shares, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever which the holder would have
been entitled to receive upon the happening of the applicable corporate event had the Preferred Warrant been exercised immediately prior

The intrinsic value of Predecessor options exercised

2024. 

On March 25, 2024, the Company s Board adopted,
and its stockholders approved, an Equity Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan ). The 2024 Plan provides for the granting of stock
options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to employees, members of the Board of Directors and non-employee consultants.
Stock options granted generally expire after their original date of grant and generally vest on the first anniversary
of the grant, then monthly to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting
date. The plan allows for the issuance of up to shares of Common Stock. On April 30, 2024, the 2024 Plan was amended to
include additional shares of Common Stock in the pool available for future grant awards. 

The Company estimated the fair value of stock
options granted during the period February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 using Black-Scholes with the following weighted average
assumptions: 

The
Common Stock expected dividend yield assumption of is based on the expectation of no dividend payouts to Common Stock. 

The
risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Department of Treasury instruments whose term was most consistent with the expected
life of the Company s stock options. 

The
expected stock price volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities for industry peers, as the Company
does not have sufficient public trading history for the Company s Common Stock. The Company will continue to analyze the historical
stock price volatility and expected term assumption as more historical price data for the Company s Common Stock becomes available. 

The
expected lives of the Company s stock options are estimated based on the type of award issued using approaches that do not rely
on the historical data of the Company, as management has concluded there is insufficient data to provide a reasonable forward-looking
estimate. The expected life of an incentive stock option is estimated using the simplified method described in Staff Accounting Bulletin
Topic 14 Share-Based Payment. All incentive stock options awarded by the Company have terms consistent with this approach, which
is to calculate the weighted average midpoint between the vesting date of each vesting tranche and the termination date of the option.
Non-qualified stock options are valued using the contractual life as the expected term.

On October 23, 2024, the trading price for CERo
common stock closed under and was the tenth consecutive trading day to do so. On October 24, 2024, the Company received letter
from the staff at The Nasdaq Global Market Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because its Common Stock had a closing
bid price of or less for consecutive trading days, it was no longer eligible to rely upon the 180-day cure period that commenced
when the Company received notice in July 2024 that the closing bid price was below for consecutive trading days and was scheduled
to expire on . In addition, on October 30, 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff at Nasdaq notifying the
Company that it had not regained compliance with the continued listing requirement to maintain a minimum market value of 
for its listed securities within the 180-day compliance period granted by Nasdaq in May 2024. Each such deficiency results in the commencement
of delisting proceedings. However, the Company has requested a hearing from Nasdaq and plans to submit a plan to regain compliance with
the listing requirements at such hearing. 

On November 8, 2024, the Company consummated

Overview 

CERo Therapeutics, Inc. (Predecessor) was incorporated
in Delaware on September 23, 2016, and is based in South San Francisco, California. Predecessor was focused on developing its therapeutic
platform to genetically engineer human immune cells to fight cancer and did not begin clinical development or product commercialization.
The Company s efforts will focus on continued product development, including clinical development, to support regulatory approval
to commercialize and subsequent product commercialization. 

On June 4, 2023, Predecessor entered into a Business
Combination Agreement (as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of February 5, 2024
and Amendment No. 2 to the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of February 13, 2024, the Business Combination Agreement by and among PBAX and PBCE Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Predecessor,
with Predecessor surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBAX (the Merger ). In connection with the consummation of the
Business Combination on February 14, 2024, PBAX changed its corporate name to CERo Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. 

At the effective time of the Merger, (i) each
outstanding share of Predecessor common stock, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive shares of Common Stock; (ii) each
outstanding option to purchase Predecessor common stock was converted into an option to purchase shares of Common Stock, par value 0.0001
per share; (iii) each outstanding share of Predecessor preferred stock, was converted into the right to receive shares of Common Stock,
and (iv) each outstanding warrant to purchase Predecessor preferred stock was converted into a warrant to acquire shares of Common Stock.
In addition, each outstanding Predecessor convertible bridge note was exchanged for shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

25 

In addition, the holders of Predecessor common
stock and Predecessor preferred stock have the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares. At the Closing, the Company issued three
pools of shares of Common Stock subject to forfeiture if the applicable conditions to transferability thereof are not satisfied: (i) 1,200,000
shares of Common Stock, which will be fully vested upon the achievement of certain adjusted stock price-based earnout targets or upon
a qualifying transaction (ii) 875,000 shares of Common Stock, pursuant to a Letter Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2024 which were
fully vested at Closing of the Merger and which were issued as an offset to the Sponsor Share Forfeiture Agreement, and (iii) 1,000,000
shares of Common Stock, which were fully vested upon the June 28, 2024 achievement of certain regulatory milestone-based earnout targets. 

As consideration for the Merger, the Company issued
to Predecessor stockholders an aggregate of 7,597,638 shares of Common Stock, including 2,200,000 Earnout Shares and 382,651 shares issuable
upon exercise of rollover options or warrants.

the Company of approximately 1.25 million. 

Investigational New Drug Application Submission 

On June 28, 2024, the Company submitted an Investigational
New Drug Application IND for its product candidate, CER-1236, to FDA. On July 26, 2024, the Company was informed by the
FDA that it has placed a clinical hold on the IND. The FDA indicated that the clinical hold has been placed as a result of insufficient
data provided with regard to two issues within pharmacology and toxicology of CER-1236. The FDA indicated that, within 30 calendar days,
it would provide a detailed official hold letter and requested that the Company hold its response until after receipt of such letter
(the Hold Letter ). 

The Company received the Hold Letter on July
26, 2024 and submitted a complete response letter to the FDA on October 21, 2024 in which the Company requested a meeting to address
the FDA s questions. 

On November 15, 2024, the Company received notice from the FDA that the
IND for CER-1236 was cleared. The Company continues to believe
that it will be able to initiate the planned clinical trial by early 2025. 

Nasdaq Notices of Non-compliance 

On July 19, 2024, the Company received a letter
(the Bid Price Requirement Letter from the staff at The Nasdaq Global Market Nasdaq notifying the Company
that, for the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of the Bid Price Requirement Letter, the closing bid price for the Common
Stock has been below the minimum 1.00 per share required for continued listing on Nasdaq set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 450(a)(1),
which is required for continued listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq (the Bid Price Requirement ). On October 23, 2024,
the trading price for CERo common stock closed under 0.10 and was the tenth consecutive trading day to do so. On October 24, 2024, the
Company received a letter from the staff at Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because its Common Stock had a closing bid price of 0.10
or less for ten consecutive trading days, it was no longer eligible to rely upon the 180-day cure period set forth in the Bid Price Requirement
Letter. 

26 

On July 19, 2024, the Company also received a
letter (the MVPHS Letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Market Value of Publicly Held Shares 
(the MVPHS of the Common Stock had been below the minimum of 15,000,000 for the last 30 consecutive business days prior
to the date of the MVPHS Letter, which is required for continued listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq (the MVPHS Requirement ). 

Such letters are in addition to the letter from
Nasdaq received by the Company on May 2, 2024 (the MVLS Letter and, together with the Bid Price Letter and the MVPHS Letter,
the Letters notifying the Company that, for the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of such MVLS Letter, the
Common Stock had traded at a value below the minimum 50,000,000 Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), which is required for continued listing of the Common Stock on Nasdaq (the
 MVLS Requirement and, together with the Bid Price Requirement and the MVPHS Requirement, the Requirements ).
On October 30, 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff at Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had not regained compliance
with the MVLS Requirement within the 180-day compliance period set forth in the MVLS Letter. 

Each of the Bid Price Requirement and MVLS Requirement
deficiencies results in the commencement of delisting proceedings. However, the Company has requested a hearing from Nasdaq and plans
to submit a plan to regain compliance with the listing requirements at such hearing. Notwithstanding that applicable Nasdaq rules provide
a 180-day compliance period to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement, the plan submitted by the Company in connection with such
hearing will be required to demonstrate a pathway to compliance with all applicable deficiencies. 

The Company intends to evaluate available options
to resolve these deficiencies and regain compliance with the Requirements. Such options may include seeking to qualify for continued listing
under a different continued listing standard of the Nasdaq Global Market or Nasdaq Capital Market, in lieu of the MVPHS and MVLS requirements,
including the Equity Standard, if the Company has sufficient stockholders equity at such time. While the Company is exercising
diligent efforts to maintain the listing of its securities on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain
or maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. 

On
November 11. 2024, the Company s stockholders approved a reverse stock split ranging from 1:25 to 1:150. 
 On November 15, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a 1:40
reverse stock split, such split anticipated to be effective on or about November [ ], 2024. Although such reverse stock split is
expected to enable regaining compliance with the Bid Price Requirement, it is not intended to contribute to regaining compliance with
the other Requirements. 

Factors Affecting Our Performance 

The Company believes that its performance and
future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for the Company but also pose risks and challenges. These
include, among others: 

the
extent to which the Company develops, in-licenses or acquires other product candidates and technologies in its product candidate pipeline; 

the
costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with the Company s product candidates
and other programs as the Company advances them through preclinical and clinical development; 

the
number and development requirements of product candidates that the Company may pursue; 

the
costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of the Company s product candidates; 

27 

the
Company s potential headcount growth and associated costs as it expands its R D capabilities, maintains the administrative
functions required for a publicly traded company, and establishes and expands its commercial infrastructure and operations; 

the
costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any
of the Company s product candidates for which the Company receives market approval; 

the
revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of the Company s product candidates for which it receives marketing approval; 

competition
from other similar product candidates; and, 

ability to raise sufficient capital to maintain operations. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

Predecessor and the Company have not recognized
any revenue from any sources, including from product sales, and the Company does not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products
in the foreseeable future. If the development efforts for the Company s product candidates, each of which is a specific product
and indication combination, are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if the Company executes license agreements with third
parties, the Company may generate revenue from R D services, from the achievement of development milestones or from milestones and
royalties related to product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when any revenues will be generated, if at all. 

Operating Expenses 

Research and Development Expenses 

R D expenses consist of discovery activities,
manufacturing development and production, preclinical and clinical development, and regulatory filing for product candidates. R D
expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in R D are capitalized
until the goods or services are received. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses through asset acquisitions, if incurred, will
be charged to R D expense if the licensed technology has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use.
R D expenses include or could include: 

employee-related
expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation and other related costs for those employees involved in R D
efforts; 

external
R D expenses incurred under agreements with pre-clinical research organizations, clinical research organizations, investigative sites,
centralized clinical laboratories, and consultants to conduct preclinical and clinical studies; 

costs
related to manufacturing material for preclinical studies and clinical trials, including fees paid to contract development and manufacturing
organizations; 

product-liability
insurance for clinical development product(s); 

laboratory
supplies and research materials; 

software
and systems related to R D activities; 

costs
related to regulatory filing and compliance; and 

28 

facilities,
depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, and equipment. 

Product candidates in later stages of development
generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and
duration of later-stage clinical trials. The Company plans to substantially increase its R D expenses for the foreseeable future as
it continues the development of its product candidates through clinical development. The Company cannot determine with certainty the timing
of initiation, the duration or the costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials required for regulatory approval
due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the
probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. The Company anticipates that it will make determinations
as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the
results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and ongoing assessments as to each product
candidate s commercial potential. The Company will need to, and plans to, raise substantial additional capital in the future. Future
R D expenses may vary significantly between periods and from current expectations based on factors such as: 

expenses
incurred to conduct preclinical studies required to advance product candidates into clinical trials; 

per
patient clinical trial costs based on a number of factors, including number of patient clinical visits, clinical laboratory testing,
and potential medical imaging; 

the
number of clinical trials required for approval, the number of patients who enroll in each clinical trial, and the number and geographic
locations of sites included in the clinical trials; 

the
length of time required to screen and enroll eligible patients, screen-failure rate, or the discontinuation rates of enrolled patients; 

potential
additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the
cost of insurance, including product liability insurance, in connection with clinical trials; and 

suspension
or termination of clinical development activities by regulators or institutional review boards for various reasons, including regulatory
noncompliance or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses consist principally
of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses
and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, accounting and tax-related services
and insurance costs. 

The Company anticipates that its general and administrative
expenses will increase in the future as the Company increases headcount and contracted services for operational support for expanded operations
and infrastructure. The Company also anticipates that general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of expenses for accounting,
audit, legal and consulting services, as well as costs associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements,
director and officer liability insurance, investor and public relations activities and other expenses associated with operating as a public
company. 

Interest and Other Income, Net 

Interest and other income, net consists predominantly
of interest income from interest bearing bank accounts, interest expense on payables, and the gain or loss on the revaluation of derivative
liabilities, which represents the change in fair value of earnout liabilities or outstanding warrants between periods.

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 2.6
million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023,
reflecting an increase of 2.4 million. The increase in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, over the three-month period ended
September 30, 2023, was predominantly due to the expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company. The hiring of senior
management in G A resulted in an increase of 0.4 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023, and expenses associated with public company filings and financings increased legal expenses 1.0 million,
and accounting and filing-associated expenses 0.2 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023. Business consulting services and directors fees increased 0.5 million in the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Public company insurance coverage increased insurance
expenses 0.1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Other
expenses, including corporate communication expenses, recruiting expenses, IT expenses, and travel costs increased 0.2 million in the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses were 1.8 million
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, reflecting
an increase of 0.5 million. The increase was related to increased research and development activity as the Company addressed regulatory
questions related to the IND for CER-1236 and prepared for the clinical trial, anticipated to start after the clinical hold for CER-1236
is lifted. Clinical expenses increased 0.2 million, manufacturing increased by 0.1 million and research and development consulting increased
by 0.3 million, offset by a reduction of 0.2 million in compensation expenses and the scientific operations were conducted with more
consulting and fewer employees in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.
The remaining 0.1 million increase in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, over the three-month period ended September 30,
2023, was related to lab supplies and expenses, additional pre-clinical work and facilities rent escalation. 

The Company anticipates that its R D expenses
will significantly increase in the future as the Company increases headcount, compensation expense, and contracted services for preclinical
and clinical development of its product candidates, as well as for manufacturing of product to be used in clinical development. 

Other Income 

Other income was 0.2 million for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The immaterial change was related to higher interest income and slightly lower gain from revaluation
of liabilities in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 7.9
million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023,
reflecting an increase of 5.7 million. The increase in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, over the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023, was predominantly due to a 1.8 million expense consisting of the remaining underwriting fees from the PBAX initial
public offering, which were earned on the consummation of the business combination. Additionally, the hiring of senior management in G A
resulted in an increase of 1.6 million, including recruiting fees. Legal fees increased 0.8 million and business consulting increased
 0.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Expenses related
to services required for SEC compliance, such as printing and transfer agency fees, increased 0.4 million and public company insurance
coverage increased insurance expenses 0.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023. Corporate communications and director fees each increased 0.2 million in the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The additional expenses are all driven by the increased expenses
of operational compliance as a public company. 

31 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses were 6.2 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase of
 1.9 million. The increase was related to increased R D activity as the Company prepared and filed the IND for CER-1236, prepared
for the clinical trial initiation, and conducted additional experiments in response to the FDA questions related to the IND. Compensation
increased 0.1 million, clinical expenses increased 0.2 million, and consulting expenses increased 0.9 million in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, due to activities related to the preparation of the IND and responses to questions from FDA, and preparation
for the anticipated clinical trial for CER-1236.. To complete the IND application, multiple manufacturing runs were necessary, increasing
manufacturing costs by 0.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023. Additional studies required to address FDA questions increased pre-clinical study costs by 0.3 million. The remaining 0.2 million
increase in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, versus the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, was predominantly related
to lab supplies and expenses and facilities rent escalation. 

The Company anticipates that its R D expenses
will significantly increase in the future as the Company increases headcount, compensation expense, and contracted services for preclinical
and clinical development of its product candidates, as well as for manufacturing of clinical product to be used in clinical development.

Other Income 

Other income was 5.1 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase of
 4.6 million. The increase in 2024 relative to 2023 was predominantly due to the 4.7 million change in value of the Company s Earnout
Liability in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Settlement of vendor liabilities in 2024 resulted in a 0.6 million increase
in income in 2024, offset by an additional 0.1 million less interest income and 0.6 million other expense for the delayed S-1 penalty. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Capital Requirements 

Predecessor and the Company have not generated
any revenue from any source and the Company does not expect to generate revenue for at least the next few years. If the Company fails
to complete the timely development of, or fails to obtain regulatory approval for, its product candidates, the ability of the Company
to generate future revenue will be adversely affected. The Company does not know when, or if, it will generate any revenue from its product
candidates, and does not expect to generate revenue unless and until the Company obtains regulatory approval and commercialization of
its product candidates. 

The Company expects its expenses to increase significantly
in connection with its ongoing activities, particularly as it continues and expands research, preclinical development, and clinical development
to support marketing approval for its product candidates. In addition, if the Company obtains approval for any of its product candidates,
the Company expects to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore,
the Company expects to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 

The Company, therefore, anticipates that substantial
additional funding will be needed in connection with its continuing operations. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 3.4 million
in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents. The Company intends to devote most of the available cash to the preclinical and clinical
development of its product candidates and public company compliance costs. Based on current business plans, the Company believes that
the cash available at September 30, 2024 will not fund its operations and capital requirements for 12 months after the filing of the unaudited
financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The Company has arranged two equity lines of credit, one providing
for the sale of up to 25,000,000 newly issued shares of Common Stock and the other providing for the purchase of up to 25 million of
Common Stock on the satisfaction of certain conditions. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 2.8 million shares remaining in the first
ELOC, which was fully depleted on October 3, 2024, and 25 million remaining in the second ELOC, which was replaced with a second ELOC
arranged with the investor in the first ELOC (see Note 14 Subsequent Events). The Company has no guarantee that the conditions
will be satisfied to require the purchase of all, or any additional amount, of the Equity Line of Credit ELOC funds. Any
estimate as to how long the Company expects the net proceeds from the ELOC funding may fund the Company s operations is based on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than its current expectations.
Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond the Company s control, could result in less cash and cash equivalents available
to fund operations or cause the Company to consume capital significantly faster than currently anticipated, and the Company may need to
seek additional funds from additional sources sooner than planned. 

32 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drug products, the Company is unable to estimate the exact
amount of its operating capital requirements. The Company s future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including,
but not limited to those listed under Factors Affecting Our Performance above. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting
preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and the
Company may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition,
the Company s product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Commercial revenues, if any, will be derived
from sales of product candidates that the Company does not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all. Accordingly,
the Company will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve its business objectives. Adequate additional financing may
not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale
of equity or convertible debt securities, the terms of these equity securities or this debt may restrict the Company s ability to
operate. Any future debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve covenants limiting and restricting the ability to take
specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into profit-sharing or other arrangements or
declaring dividends. If the Company raises additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or
licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be required to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future revenue streams,
research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company. If the Company is unable
to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its R D programs or
future commercialization efforts.

Net cash used in operating activities 

Net cash used in operating activities increased
 6.6 million from 4.8 million to 11.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 respectively. The increase
in cash used was largely related to having a 4.8 million increase in the adjustment to net loss related to the gain on the revaluation
of derivative liabilities. The difference in net loss reflected 3.0 million more cash being used, offset by a larger non-cash adjustment
for stock-based compensation of 1.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. The difference of 0.1 million
of cash resulting from increasing accounts payable and accruals was offset by 0.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and 0.6 million
in vendor settlements in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. The remaining difference was an additional 0.1 million
in adjustment to lease liability due to rent escalation.

Net cash provided by financing activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities
increased 11.7 million from 0.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 12.2 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024. The increase was related to the net proceeds of 7.3 million from the issuance of Series A and B
Preferred Stock, the net proceeds of 0.7 million from the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock and associated warrants, the gross
proceeds of 4.3 million for the sale of common stock under the ELOC, and 0.1 million related to net insurance financing. These
increases in cash were partially offset by the 0.6 million borrowing under the bridge loan in 2023, for which there was no
equivalent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of expenses incurred during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and
assumptions include the estimates of the fair values of convertible preferred stock, earnout-related Common Stock, and preferred stock
warrant liability, stock-based compensation expense, the fair value of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities, and the valuation allowance
associated with deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Predecessor and the Company define its critical
accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain
and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which
it applies those principles. While significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the Company s unaudited
financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, the Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies used
in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. 

Fair value measurements Fair value
is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. In determining fair value, the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability
(the inputs) are based on a tiered fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels, as follows: 

Level 1 
 
 Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 

Level 2 
 
 Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3 
 
 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which require the Company to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. 

The categorization of a financial instrument within
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The carrying amounts of cash, restricted cash,
and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due
to their relatively short-term maturities. 

34 

Research and development R D
costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, occupancy, materials and supplies, contracted research,
consulting arrangements, and other expenses incurred in the pursuit of R D programs. R D costs are expensed as incurred. 

Stock-based compensation The Company
periodically issues Common Stock and stock options to officers, directors, and consultants for services rendered. The Company accounts
for stock-based compensation as measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option
pricing model Black-Scholes to estimate option award fair value, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including
the expected volatility of Common Stock, expected risk-free interest rate, and the option s expected life. The Company also evaluates
the impact of modifications made to the original terms of equity awards when they occur. The fair value of restricted stock awards is
based upon the share price of the Common Stock on the date of grant. 

The fair value of equity awards that are expected
to vest is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized net of
actual forfeitures when they occur, as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and in research
and development or, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying employee s
role within the Company. 

Income taxes The Company accounts
for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
expected to be realized. 

The Company follows tax accounting requirements
for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure in the financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. No liability related to uncertain tax positions is recorded in the financial statements.
It is the Company s policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense,
as necessary. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties associated with income tax since inception. Tax years subsequent
to 2020 are subject to examination by federal and state authorities. 

There were no material changes in critical accounting
estimates during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has concluded that there are no recent
accounting pronouncements expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About
Market Risk 

The Company s primary exposure to market
risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because of the
Company s investments, including cash equivalents, which may be in the form of a money market fund. 

In the future, the Company may contract with vendors
invoicing in a foreign denominated currency. As a result, the Company may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection
with certain of these agreements. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar will be recorded based on
exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. As of September 30, 2024, all transactions have been denominated in U.S. dollars. 

Inflation will generally affect the Company by
increasing the cost of labor and costs associated with preclinical and clinical trials and future manufacturing and commercialization
activities as well as general corporate costs. The Company does not believe that inflation had a material effect on the Company s
business, financial condition or results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2024, but increased inflation may materially impact
the Company in later periods of 2024 and beyond.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting
Company Status 

In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth
company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. PBAX previously elected the extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would
be applicable to private companies. The Company expects to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period. 

In addition, as an emerging growth company, the
Company may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies.
These provisions include: 

being
permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements,
with correspondingly reduced disclosure in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

an
exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 

reduced
disclosure about the Company s executive compensation arrangements in its periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; 

exemptions
from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

an
exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical
audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements. 

The Company will cease to qualify as an emerging
growth company on the date that is the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date
of the first sale of shares of PBAX Class A Common Stock in its initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in
which the Company has more than 1.07 billion in total annual gross revenues, (iii) the date on which the Company is deemed
to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of the Common Stock that is held
by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (iv) the date on which the Company has issued more than
 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over the prior three-year period. The Company may choose to take advantage of some but not all
of these reduced reporting burdens. The Company has taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements in this Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
the information contained herein may be different than you might obtain from other public companies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with
the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter,
there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

36 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1a. Risk Factors 

Except as set forth below,
there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
or results of operations . 

The issuance of shares of our Common Stock
upon conversion or exercise of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Common Warrants and other securities
that we may issue in future financing transactions may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. 

As of November 1, 2024, the Company currently has outstanding (i) 3,075
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into 64,062,500 shares of Common Stock at the current effective conversion price of 0.06;
(ii) 486 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, convertible into 10,125,000 shares of Common Stock at the current effective conversion price
of 0.06; (iii) 2,853 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, convertible into 12,736,607 shares of Common Stock at the current effective
conversion price of 0.224; (iv) 2,462 Preferred Warrants to purchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an exercise price of 800,
which would result in 2,462 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into 49,797,736 shares of Common Stock at the current effective
conversion price of 0.06; (v) 612,746 Series A Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 1.39 per share; (vi)
8,175,166 warrants Series C Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.098; and (vii) 9,879,858
Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at exercise prices ranging from 9.20 to 11.50 per
share. As of the date of this prospectus, holders of 7,069 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 140 shares of Series B Preferred Stock
and 38 Preferred Warrants have converted such shares into an aggregate of approximately 110.9 million shares of Common Stock. 

Although each of the conversion price of the preferred
shares and the exercise price of the Series A Preferred Warrants are at or above the trading price of our Common Stock as of the date
of this report, if such trading price increases, such conversion prices and exercise price will not change as a result thereof and could
be below the trading price of our Common Stock as of the date of any future conversion or exercise thereof, resulting in dilution to our
stockholders. In addition, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock contain
certain penalties and adjustments to the amount included in determination of the conversion rate following certain breaches of the Company s
obligations thereunder, including, among other things, as a result of a failure to file or cause the SEC to declare one or more registration
statements relating to the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof by specified deadlines, certain defaults
under indebtedness of the Company or judgments against the Company and failure to deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion in a
timely manner. For example, the penalties and adjustments include a 25 premium added to the stated value for determining the conversion
rate in connection with breaches other than the breach of the requirement to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock by August 14, 2025, which results in a 50 premium, and the addition to the stated value of an amount equal to the value
of the shares of Common Stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock would have been convertible if the conversion
price were equal to 80 of the lowest volume weighted average price during the five trading days immediately prior to conversion. Such
penalties and adjustments, which applied during the period when all of the conversions since the Business Combination described in the
preceding paragraph occurred as a result of a failure to file and cause the SEC to declare a registration statement with respect to the
resale of the underlying shares in a timely manner, have resulted and may in the future result in the issuance of shares of Common Stock
at an effective conversion price below the trading price of our Common Stock at the time of such conversion. 

37 

We cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance
with all of the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock and that such penalties and
adjustments will not apply in the future. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not issue additional convertible or other derivative
securities with highly dilutive penalty or adjustment provisions. As described elsewhere in this report, the Company needs to obtain financing
to fund its research and development activities and, if the IND is accepted, clinical trials, as well as other operations. Under challenging
conditions in the equity capital markets, particularly for pre-commercialization biotech companies, we may have no viable alternatives
to agreeing to inclusion of such provisions in the terms of future financings. 

Clinical development and the regulatory
approval process involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and results of earlier studies and preclinical data,
and trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results. If our preclinical studies and clinical trials are not sufficient to
support regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately
be unable to complete, the development of such product candidate. 

The research, testing, manufacturing,
labeling, licensure, sale, marketing and distribution of biological products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other
regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted
to market our product candidates in the United States or in any foreign countries until they receive the requisite licensure from the
applicable regulatory authorities of such jurisdictions. We have not previously submitted a BLA to the FDA or similar licensure applications
to comparable foreign regulatory authorities. A BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to
establish the product candidate s safety, purity and potency for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant
information regarding the manufacturing controls for the product. We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create further
challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates may be uncertain,
complex, expensive and lengthy, and licensure may not be obtained. 

We cannot be certain that
our preclinical studies and clinical trial results will be sufficient to support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Clinical
testing is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Human clinical trials are expensive
and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Failure or delay can occur
at any time during the clinical trial process. 

We may experience delays
in obtaining the FDA s authorization to initiate clinical trials under future INDs and completing ongoing clinical studies of our
product candidates due to a variety of factors. Additionally, we cannot be certain that preclinical studies or clinical trials for our
product candidates will begin on time, not require redesign, enroll an adequate number of subjects on time, or be completed on schedule,
if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to: 

the
availability of financial resources to commence and complete the planned trials 

the
FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 

delays
in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial; 

38 

our
inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority that any of our product candidates
are safe, potent and pure; 

the
FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s disagreement with our trial protocol or the interpretation of data from
preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

our
inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of any of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived
risks; 

the
FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

the
results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities
for licensure; 

the
data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign
regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain licensure
of our product candidates in the United States or elsewhere; 

reaching
agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CDMOs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation
and may vary significantly among different CDMOs and clinical trial sites; 

obtaining
IRB or ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site; 

recruiting
an adequate number of suitable patients to participate in a clinical trial; 

having
subjects complete a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up; 

clinical
trial sites deviating from clinical trial protocol or dropping out of a clinical trial; 

addressing
subject safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial; 

adding
a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; 

obtaining
sufficient product supply of product candidate for use in preclinical studies or clinical trials from third-party suppliers; 

the
FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s findings of deficiencies or failure to approve the manufacturing processes
or facilities of third-party manufacturers upon which we rely; or 

the
approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering
our clinical data insufficient for approval. 

We
may experience numerous adverse or unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical studies and clinical trials that could delay
or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including: 

we
may receive feedback from regulatory authorities that requires us to modify the design of our clinical trials; 

we
may obtain a result from preclinical studies such as a binder specificity study or a safety toxicology study that require us to modify
the design of our clinical trials, abandon our research efforts for product candidates, or result in delays; 

39 

clinical
trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct
additional clinical trials or abandon our research efforts for our other product candidates; 

the
number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical
trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; 

our
third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, fail to maintain adequate quality controls or be unable to provide
us with sufficient product supply to conduct and complete preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates in a timely
manner, or at all; 

we
or our investigators might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including non-compliance
with regulatory requirements, a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics
or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

the
cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; 

the
quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates
may be insufficient or inadequate; 

regulators
may revise the requirements for approving our product candidates, or such requirements may not be as we anticipate; and 

future
collaborators may conduct clinical trials in ways they view as advantageous to them but that are suboptimal for us. 

If we are required to conduct
additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to
successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive
or are only moderately positive or if there are safety concerns, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and
we may incur significant additional costs. In addition, costs to treat patients with relapsed or refractory cancer and to treat potential
side effects that may result from our product candidates can be significant. Accordingly, our clinical trial costs are likely to be significantly
higher than those for more conventional therapeutic technologies or drug product candidates. 

We could also encounter delays
if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such clinical trials are being conducted,
by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such clinical trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend
or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory
requirements or our clinical trial protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory
authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a
benefit from the product candidates, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue
the clinical trial. For example, in July 2024, we announced a clinical hold as a result of insufficient data provided with regard to two
issues within pharmacology and toxicology of CER-1236. We have requested a meeting with FDA and plan to work expeditiously to resolve
this clinical hold so that CER-1236 may proceed to the clinic, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to address the clinical
hold issues to FDA s satisfaction or in a timely manner to resume development. 

Any delay in obtaining, or
inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates and would materially
adversely impact our business and prospects and our ability to generate revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed
or not realized at all. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical
trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. If one or more of our product candidates
generally prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our CER-T cell platform would have little, if any, value, which would
have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

40 

Any of these factors, many
of which are beyond our control, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, or a
delay in such approval, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects. Of the large number of biological
products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized.
Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive licensure from the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authorities for any
of our product candidates, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory may license our product candidates for a more limited indication
or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not license our
product candidates with the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of such product candidates. 

The FDA has placed a clinical hold on
CER-1236. If the FDA does not remove the clinical hold in a timely basis, or at all, our development timelines and our business may be
adversely affected, and our stock price may decline. 

As previously announced by
the Company in July 2024, the FDA placed a full clinical hold on CER-1236 as a result of insufficient data provided with regard to two
issues within pharmacology and toxicology of CER-1236. We have requested a meeting with FDA and plan to work expeditiously to resolve
this clinical hold so that CER-1236 may proceed to the clinic, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to address the clinical
hold issues to FDA s satisfaction or in a timely manner to resume development. If the FDA does not lift the clinical hold
in a timely manner, or at all, our long-term development timeline for CER-1236 and our business, financial condition or results
of operations, may be adversely affected.
