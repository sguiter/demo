Forward-looking Statements 

Statements included in this report and in future filings by TrustCo with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in TrustCo s press releases, and in oral statements made with the approval of an
 authorized executive officer that are not historical or current facts, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and
 uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such words as may, will, should, could, would,
 estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, plan, seek, expect and similar expressions. TrustCo wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

In addition to factors described under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and under the Risk Factor discussion in TrustCo s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the factors
 listed below, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect TrustCo s actual results and could cause TrustCo s actual financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in any forward-looking statement. 
 Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently elevated by and may or will continue to be heightened by volatility in financial markets and macroeconomic or geopolitical concerns related to ongoing inflation, continued elevated
 interest rates and ongoing armed conflicts (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas).

Risks Related to Our Operations 

changes in interest rates have impacted and may continue to impact our financial condition and results of operations;

ongoing inflationary pressures and continued elevated prices have affected and may continue to affect our results of operations and financial condition;

exposure to credit risk in our lending activities;

our commercial loan portfolio is increasing and the inherently higher risk of loss may lead to additional provisions for credit losses or charge-offs, which would
 negatively impact earnings and capital; 

the allowance for credit losses on loans ACLL is not sufficient to cover expected loan losses, resulting in a decrease in earnings;

our inability to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors or borrowers or meet our operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other activities;

we have been and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility and lender liability;

our dependency upon the services of the management team;

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud;

if the business continuity and disaster recovery plans that we have in place are not adequate to continue our operations in the event of a disaster, the business
 disruption can adversely impact its operations;

our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss;

new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks;

we are exposed to climate risk;

3 

Index 

societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers;

increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance
 practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks

Risks Related to Market Conditions 

a prolonged economic downturn, especially one affecting our geographic market area, will adversely affect our operations and financial results;

instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of
 operations and financial condition;

any downgrade in the credit rating of the U.S. government or default by the U.S. government as a result of political conflicts over legislation to raise the U.S.
 government s debt limit may have a material adverse effect on us;

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us;

any government shutdown could adversely affect the U.S. and global economy and our liquidity, financial condition and earnings;

the trust wealth management fees we receive may decrease as a result of poor investment performance, in either relative or absolute terms, which could decrease our
 revenues and net earnings;

Risks Related to Compliance and Regulation 

regulatory capital rules could slow our growth, cause us to seek to raise additional capital, or both;

changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income;

changes in cybersecurity or privacy regulations may increase our compliance costs, limit our ability to gain insight from data and lead to increased scrutiny;

restrictions on data collection and use may limit opportunities to gain business insights useful to running our business and offering innovative products and services;

non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions;

changes in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the Internal Revenue Service or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our
 business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows;

our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations and other limitations that may affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to
 repurchase our common stock;

we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate if Trustco Realty Corp. Trustco Realty fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT 

changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings;

4 

Index 

Risks Related to Competition 

strong competition within the Bank s market areas could hurt profits and slow growth;

consumers and businesses are increasingly using non-banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations;

Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Third Parties, and Technology 

our business could be adversely affected by third-party service providers, data breaches, and cyber-attacks;

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our
 results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm;

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm
 our business;

we could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, our computer systems;

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities 

provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and New York law may discourage or prevent takeover attempts, and these provisions may have the effect of
 reducing the market price of our stock; and

we cannot guarantee that the allocation of capital to various alternatives, including stock repurchase plans, will enhance long-term stockholder value.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although TrustCo believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking
 statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. The foregoing list should not be construed
 as exhaustive, and the Company disclaims any obligation to subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements, or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated
 events, except to the extent required by law.

 well capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If a bank is undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. The federal banking
 agencies are required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution or its holding company. Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s or

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TrustCo Bank Corp NY

Glenville, New York

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information

We have reviewed the consolidated statement of financial condition of TrustCo Bank Corp NY (the Company as of September 30, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for
 the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and the related changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related notes
 (collectively referred to as the interim financial information or statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in
 conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated statement of financial condition of the Company as of
 December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 11, 2024, we expressed an
 unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
 relation to the consolidated statement of condition from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
 are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope
 than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Item 2.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

The review that follows focuses on the factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of TrustCo during the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, with comparisons to the
 corresponding period in 2023, as applicable. Unless otherwise indicated, net interest income and interest margin are presented in this discussion on a non-GAAP taxable equivalent basis. For the periods presented, there is no difference between
 these measures and GAAP net interest income and GAAP net interest margin. The consolidated interim financial statements and related notes, as well as the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the
 SEC on March 11, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), should also be read in conjunction with this review. Amounts in prior period consolidated interim financial statements are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the current period s
 presentation.

Following this Management s Discussion and Analysis are the Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity: Interest Rates and Interest Differential tables, which give a detailed breakdown of
 TrustCo s average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Economic Overview

During the third quarter of 2024, financial markets got off to a good start as investors were gauging whether the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates, which it did by 50 basis points in
 September 2024. For the third quarter of 2024, the S P 500 Index was up 5.5 , Nasdaq was up 2.6 , and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.2 compared to the second quarter of 2024. The 10 year Treasury bond averaged 3.95 during Q3
 2024 compared to 4.45 in Q2 2024, a decrease of 50 basis points. The 2 year Treasury bond average rate decreased 79 basis points to 4.04 , which eased the inverted yield curve over the prior quarter. The spread between the 10 year and the
 2-year Treasury bonds decreased from a -0.38 on average in Q2 2024 to -0.09 in Q3 2024. Generally, steeper yield curves are favorable for portfolio mortgage lenders like TrustCo, and the table below illustrates the range of rate movements for
 both short term and longer-term rates. The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC increased the target range for the Federal Funds rate eleven times in 2022 and 2023, by a total of 525 basis points, to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 , then lowered it
 in September 2024 by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . All of the increases prior to 2024 were expressly made in response to inflationary pressures. Spreads of most asset classes to the comparative treasury yield, including agency
 securities, corporates, municipals and mortgage-backed securities, continue to be down as compared to the levels seen before the pandemic. Additionally, changes in rates and spreads continue to be affected by global economic concerns.

The United States economy proved to be resilient in 2023 and has also seen improvements as we continue through 2024. Economic conditions can vary significantly over geographic areas, with strength concentrated in
 and around major population centers on the coasts and in certain areas where economic activity has been driven by specific regional factors.

Hurricane Helene made landfall along Florida s Big Bend coast in September, 2024 ultimately impacting parts of the Southeastern United States. The impact of Hurricane Helene on TrustCo s operations was not
 significant, and is not expected to be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida in October 2024, bringing heavy rain, hurricane or tropical storm force winds, storm
 surge and power outages to portions of central Florida. All of our branches and office locations have re-opened for business, and damage from the storm was negligible. There were no significant impacts to banking operations. We are still in the
 process of finalizing our assessment of the potential impact of Hurricane Milton on our customers, credit portfolio, and future lending activity, although we do not expect it to have a significant impact.

53 

Index 

Management believes that TrustCo s long-term focus on traditional banking services and practices historically has enabled the Company to avoid significant impact from asset quality problems, and that the Company s
 strong liquidity and solid capital positions have allowed the Company to continue to conduct business in a manner consistent with its past practice. While we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, should general housing prices and
 other economic measures, such as unemployment in the Company s market areas, deteriorate as a result of continued elevated interest rates, financial sector instability, a potential or actual default on the federal debt or other reasons, the
 Company may experience an increase in the level of credit risk and in the amount of its classified and nonperforming loans.

Financial Overview

TrustCo recorded net income of 12.9 million, or 0.68 of diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 14.7 million, or 0.77 of diluted earnings per share,
 in the same period in 2023. Return on average assets was 0.84 and 0.96 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Return on average equity was 7.74 and 9.32 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30,
 2024 and 2023.

The primary factors accounting for the change in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year were:

A decrease of 3.6 million, or 8.4 , in GAAP net interest income and taxable equivalent net interest income (non-GAAP) compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in interest expense due to the current
 interest rate environment.

An increase of 400 thousand in provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 primarily as a result of loan growth.

An increase of 357 thousand in noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in financial services income due to higher assets balances under
 management.

A decrease of 1.3 million in noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 as a result of lower salaries and employee benefits due to a decrease in full time equivalent employees and lower
 employee benefits, as well as a decrease in other noninterest expense categories.

TrustCo recorded net income of 37.6 million, or 1.97 of diluted earnings per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 48.8 million, or 2.57 of diluted earnings per share,
 in the same period in 2023. Return on average assets was 0.82 and 1.08 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Return on average equity was 7.68 and 10.57 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30,
 2024 and 2023.

54 

Index 

The primary factors accounting for the change in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year were:

A decrease of 20.2 million, or 15.2 , in GAAP net interest income and taxable equivalent net interest income (non-GAAP) compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in interest expense due to the
 current interest rate environment.

An increase of 1.7 million in provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of loan growth.

An increase of 1.6 million in noninterest income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a gain of 1.4 million based on the conversion privilege of the Visa
 Class C common stock as described below, an increase in financial services income due to higher assets balances under management, partially offset by a decrease in fees for services to customers.

A decrease of 4.9 million in noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of lower salaries and employee benefits due to a decrease in full time equivalent
 employees and lower employee benefits, as well as a decrease in other noninterest expense.

Visa Exchange Offer

During the second quarter of 2024, Visa Inc. accepted the Company s tender of its 6,528 shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C common
 stock. As a result, during the second quarter of 2024, the Company marked it Visa Class C common stock to fair value and recorded an unrealized gain of 1.4 million. The Company then sold them all in the third quarter of 2024 and recorded an
 additional gain of 23 thousand, thus resulting in no remaining carrying value on the Company s Statement of Financial Condition. Once the Company is able to convert the remaining shares of Visa Class B-2 common stock to Visa Class C shares, the
 Company will mark these shares to fair value on a recurring basis using the Visa Class A shares as evidence of orderly transactions between market participants for similar securities issued by Visa. The Company originally obtained the shares in
 2008. The carrying value of Visa B-2 shares is nominal as of September 30, 2024.

Asset/Liability Management

The Company strives to generate its earnings capabilities through a mix of core deposits funding a prudent mix of earning assets. Additionally, TrustCo attempts to maintain adequate liquidity and reduce the
 sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates to an acceptable level while enhancing profitability both on a short term and long term basis.

TrustCo s results are affected by a variety of factors including competitive and economic conditions in the specific markets in which the Company
 operates and, more generally, in the national economy, financial markets and the regulatory environment. Each of these factors is dynamic, and changes in any area can have an impact on TrustCo s results. 
 Included in the 2023 Form 10-K is a description of the effect interest rates had on the results for the year 2023 compared to 2022. Many of the same market factors discussed in the 2023 Annual Report, including instability in the financial
 services sector and heightened global economic concerns, continued to have a significant impact on results through the third quarter of 2024. In addition, as the fourth quarter of 2024 progresses, the potential changes in regulatory and
 economic policy following the U.S. presidential election could give rise to interest rate volatility. 

55

TrustCo competes with other financial service providers based upon many factors including quality of service, convenience of operations and rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. In the experience of
 management, the absolute level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and customers expectations with respect to the direction of interest rates have a significant impact on the volume of loan and deposit originations in any particular
 period.

Interest rates have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of all financial services companies. One of the most important interest rates used to control national economic policy is the
 Federal Funds rate. This is the interest rate utilized within the banking system for overnight borrowings for institutions with the highest credit rating. As discussed above, the FOMC increased the target range for the federal funds rate
 eleven times in 2022 and 2023 by a total of 525 basis points, to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 by the end of 2023. In September 2024 the FOMC met and lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 where it remains as
 of September 30, 2024.

The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury bond and other long-term interest rates have significant influence on the rates for new residential real estate loans and longer term investments. These changes in
 interest rates have an effect on the Company relative to the interest income on loans, securities, and Federal Funds sold and other short-term instruments as well as the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Federal Funds sold
 portfolio and other short term investments are affected primarily by changes in the Federal Funds target rate. Deposit interest rates are most affected by short term market interest rates. Also, changes in interest rates have an effect on the
 recorded balance of the securities available for sale portfolio, which are recorded at fair value. Generally, as market interest rates increase, the fair value of the securities will decrease and the reverse is also generally applicable. 
 Interest rates on new residential real estate loan originations are also influenced by the rates established by secondary market participants such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Company establishes rates that management determines are
 appropriate in light of the long-term nature of residential real estate loans while remaining competitive. Higher market interest rates also generally increase the value of retail deposits.

TrustCo s principal loan products are residential real estate loans. As noted above, residential real estate loans and longer term investments are most affected by the changes in longer term market interest rates
 such as the 10-year Treasury. The 10 year Treasury yield decreased 50 basis points, on average, during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Index 

While TrustCo has been affected by changes in financial markets over time, management believes that the impacts have been mitigated by the Company s generally conservative approach to banking. 
 The Company utilizes a traditional underwriting process in evaluating loan applications, and since originated loans are retained in the portfolio, there is a strong incentive to be conservative in making credit decisions. For additional
 information concerning TrustCo s loan portfolio and nonperforming loans, please refer to the discussions under Loans and Nonperforming Assets, respectively. Further, the Company does not rely on borrowed funds to support its assets and
 maintains a significant level of liquidity on the asset side of the balance sheet. Management believes that these characteristics provide the Company with increased flexibility and stability during periods of market disruption and interest rate
 volatility.

A fundamental component of TrustCo s strategy has been to grow customer relationships and the deposits and loans that are part of those relationships. Management believes that the Company has
 significant capacity to grow its balance sheet given its extensive branch network and it expects that growth to be profitable. The current interest rate environment, however, has narrowed the margin on incremental balance sheet expansion. While
 the Company has not changed its fundamental long-term strategy in regard to utilizing its excess capacity, management continually evaluates changing conditions and may seek to limit growth or reduce the size of the balance sheet if its analysis
 indicates that doing so would be beneficial.

For the third quarter of 2024, the net interest margin was 2.61 , down 24 basis points versus the prior year s quarter. The quarterly results reflect the following significant factors:

The average balance of Federal Funds sold and other short-term investments decreased by 28.7 million and the average yield decreased 10 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in less
 interest income.

The average balance of securities available for sale decreased by 80.5 million and the average yield increased 27 basis points to 2.51 . The increase in the average yield was a result of higher yields on investments purchased during
 2023 and 2024 as well as maturities of lower yielding securities over the same period. The increase in the yield was not enough to offset the decrease in the average balance which resulted in less interest income.

The average loan portfolio grew by 127.0 million to 5.05 billion and the average yield increased 23 basis points to 4.12 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average yield increased primarily as a
 result of higher rates on loan originations as a result of the current interest rate environment.

The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased 27.7 million and the average rate paid increased 61 basis points to 1.94 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to focus on its strategy to expand the loan portfolio by offering competitive interest rates. Management believes the TrustCo residential real estate loan
 product is very competitive compared to local and national competitors. Competition remains strong in the Company s market areas.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net interest margin was 2.52 , down 49 basis points versus the prior year. The nine month results reflect the following significant factors:

57 

Index 

The average balance of Federal Funds sold and other short-term investments decreased by 50.6 million and the average yield increased 40 basis points for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase
 in the yield was not enough to offset the decrease in the average balance which resulted in less interest income.

The average balance of securities available for sale decreased by 62.5 million and the average yield increased 84 basis points to 2.53 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in the
 average yield was a result of higher yields on investments purchased during 2023 and 2024 as well as maturities of lower yielding securities over the same period. The increase in the yield was not enough to offset the decrease in the
 average balance which resulted in less interest income.

The average loan portfolio grew by 185.7 million to 5.03 billion and the average yield increased 24 basis points to 4.05 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The average yield increased primarily
 as a result of higher rates on loan originations as a result of the current interest rate environment.

The average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased 106.7 million and the average rate paid increased 96 basis points to 1.97 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

The strategy on the funding side of the balance sheet was to offer competitive core deposit products coupled with short term time accounts. This strategy has sustained TrustCo s strong liquidity position and
 continues to allow us to cross sell products to new and existing relationships and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

Earning Assets

Total average interest earning assets increased from 5.92 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to 5.94 billion in the same period of 2024 with an average yield of 4.11 in the third quarter of 2024 and 3.88 in
 the third quarter of 2023. The mix of assets invested in Federal Funds sold and other short-term investments and securities available for sale decreased while loans increased over the prior year period. Interest income on average earning
 assets increased from 57.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 61.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, on a tax equivalent basis. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income on loans due to higher interest rates
 on loan originations over the last year and variable rate loans repricing upwards, which resulted from the continued increases in the Federal Funds target rate throughout 2023 before it was reduced in September 2024.

Loans

The average balance of loans was 5.05 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and 4.92 billion in the comparable period in 2023, and the yield on loans was up 23 basis points to 4.12 . Interest income on loans was
 52.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 up 4.2 million from the same period in 2023. The increase in the yield on loans is a result of the higher interest rate environment during the third quarter.

58 

Index 

Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the average balance of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, and commercial loans all increased. The average balance of residential mortgage loans was
 4.38 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.33 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.2 . The average yield on residential mortgage loans increased by 18 basis points to 3.82 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023.

TrustCo actively markets the residential loan products within its market territories. The prolonged elevated level of higher interest rates has slowed lending across all markets we serve. As long term interest
 rates decrease we would expect the volume of lending to increase as rates become more attractive for existing mortgage customers. Mortgage loan rates are affected by a number of factors including rates on Treasury securities, the Federal Funds
 target rate and rates set by competitors and secondary market participants. TrustCo aggressively markets the unique aspects of its loan products thereby attempting to create a differentiation from other lenders. These unique aspects include low
 closing costs, fast turn-around time on loan approvals, and no escrow or mortgage insurance requirements for qualified borrowers. Assuming a change in long-term interest rates, the Company would anticipate that the unique features of its loan
 products will continue to attract customers in the residential mortgage loan area.

Commercial loans, which consist primarily of loans secured by commercial real estate, increased 18.1 million to an average balance of 279.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the
 prior year. The average yield on this portfolio was up 24 basis points to 5.45 compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of the continued elevated interest rates on new originations and variable rate loans repricing. The Company
 has sought to remain selective in underwriting commercial loans in pursuit of a favorable risk/reward balance.

The average yield on home equity credit lines increased 41 basis points to 6.53 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the year earlier period. The average balances of home equity credit lines increased
 18.7 to 380.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year.

Securities Available for Sale

The average balance of the securities available for sale portfolio for the third quarter of 2024 was 409.3 million compared to 489.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decreasing balance reflects
 routine paydowns, calls and maturities, partially offset by new investment purchases. The average yield was 2.51 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.24 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average yield is a result of higher
 yields on bonds purchased as well as lower yielding bonds maturing since the prior year quarter. This portfolio is primarily comprised of agency issued residential mortgage backed securities, bonds issued by government sponsored enterprises
 (such as Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Bank, and Freddie Mac), Small Business Administration participation certificates, corporate bonds and municipal bonds. These securities are recorded at fair value with any adjustment in fair value
 included in other comprehensive loss, net of tax.

The net unrealized loss in the available for sale securities portfolio was 22.7 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to a net unrealized loss of 32.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The net unrealized
 losses in the portfolio is the result of changes in market interest rate levels.

59 

Index 

Held to Maturity Securities

The average balance of held to maturity securities was 5.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in balances reflects routine paydowns. No new
 securities were added to this portfolio during the period. The average yield was 4.29 for the third quarter of 2024 up from 4.22 for the year earlier period. TrustCo expects to hold the securities in this portfolio until they mature or are
 called.

The net unrecognized gain in the held to maturity securities portfolio was 9 thousand as of September 30, 2024 compared to a net unrecognized loss of 62 thousand as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the net
 unrecognized gain in the portfolio is the result of changes in market interest rate levels.

As of September 30, 2024, this portfolio consisted solely of agency issued residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The balances for these securities are recorded at
 amortized cost.

Federal Funds Sold and Other Short-Term Investments

The average balance of Federal Funds sold and other short term investments was 465.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 494.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The yield was 5.27 for the
 third quarter of 2024 and 5.37 for the comparable period in 2023. Consequently, interest income from this portfolio decreased 514 thousand from 6.7 million in 2023 to 6.2 million in 2024.

The Federal Funds sold and other short-term investments portfolio is utilized to generate additional interest income and liquidity as funds are waiting to be deployed into the loan and securities portfolios.

Funding Opportunities

TrustCo utilizes various funding sources to support its earning asset portfolio. The vast majority of the Company s funding comes from traditional deposit vehicles such as savings, demand deposits,
 interest-bearing checking, money market and time deposit accounts.

Total average interest bearing deposit accounts (which includes interest bearing checking, money market accounts, savings and time deposits) increased 50.0 million to 4.50 billion for the third quarter of 2024
 versus the third quarter in the prior year, and the average rate paid increased from 1.34 for 2023 to 1.96 for 2024. Total interest expense on these deposits increased from 15.1 million to 22.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared
 to the year earlier period. From the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024, interest bearing checking account average balances were down 4.8 , certificates of deposit average balances were up 25.8 , non-interest demand average
 balances were down 4.5 , average savings balances decreased 12.5 and money market balances were down 20.1 . Overall, average balances are up from a year ago as we continue to encourage customers to retain their funds in the expanded product
 offerings of the Bank through aggressive marketing and product differentiation.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 1.05 billion and 1.03 billion, respectively, of our deposit portfolio were uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimates based on the methodologies
 and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements.

Average short-term borrowings for the third quarter were 87.7 million in 2024 compared to 110.0 million in 2023. The average rate remained the same at 0.88 during this time period. The short-term borrowings of
 the Company are cash management accounts, which represent retail accounts with customers for which the Bank has pledged certain assets as collateral.

The Company has a number of contingent funding alternatives available in addition to the large cash and cash equivalents position and the investment securities positions it maintains on its balance sheet. The Bank
 is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY and is an eligible borrower at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York FRBNY and has the ability to borrow utilizing securities and/or loans as collateral at either institution. 
 The Bank does not utilize brokered deposits as a part of its funding strategy, but does incorporate them as a potential contingent funding source within its Asset/Liability Management Policy. Like other contingent funding sources, brokered
 deposits may be tested from time to time to ensure operational and market readiness. As of September 30, 2024 the Company also has borrowing capacity of 930.2 million available with the FHLBNY. The borrowings capacity is secured by the loans
 pledged by the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings with the FHLBNY.

Net Interest Income

Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 3.6 million to 38.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The net interest spread was down 38 basis points to 2.17 in the
 third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As previously noted, the net interest margin was also down 24 basis points to 2.61 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Bank experienced some margin
 compression as funding shifted from demand deposits and savings to higher rate time deposits during the rising interest rate market. Management notes that margin compression has eased over the last quarter as maturing time deposits have been
 repriced lower due to the recent rate cut by the FRB. The Company has seen the erosion of margin stop when comparing the increase of net interest income to the prior quarter and management believes that we have reached the bottom of this rate
 cycle. Taxable equivalent net interest income has increased by 883 thousand as compared to the second quarter of 2024, and net interest margin has also increased 8 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024. The Federal Reserve s
 decision regarding whether to further cut or hold rates in the upcoming meetings will have an effect on the Company s ability to continue to decrease deposit costs which will continue to help margin in future quarters. During the second and third
 quarters of 2024, the Company has been able to lower the rates offered on our time deposits while continuing to substantially retain that product. This is expected bring down the cost of time deposits in future periods.

61 

Index 

Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 20.2 million to 113.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The net interest spread was down 70 basis points to 2.08 
 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin was down 49 basis points to 2.52 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans NPLs , which are those loans in a non accrual status and loans past due three payments or more and still accruing
 interest. Also included in the total of nonperforming assets are foreclosed real estate properties, which are included in other assets and categorized as other real estate owned.

The following describes the nonperforming assets of TrustCo as of September 30, 2024:

Nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate : Total NPLs and
 non-accrual loans were 19.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.7 million at December 31, 2023. There were no loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. The
 coverage ratio, or allowance for credit losses on loans to NPLs, was 256.9 at September 30, 2024 compared to 275.0 at December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans primarily include a mix of commercial and residential loans. Of total nonperforming loans of 19.4 million at September 30, 2024, 18.5 million were
 residential real estate loans, 780 thousand were commercial loans and mortgages and 168 thousand were installment loans, compared to 16.6 million, 850 thousand and 166 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2023.

A significant percentage of nonperforming loans are residential real estate loans, which are historically lower-risk than most other types of loans. Net chargeoffs were 104 thousand on
 residential real estate loans (including home equity lines of credit) for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net recoveries of 26 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. Management believes that these loans have been appropriately written
 down where required.

Ongoing portfolio management is intended to result in early identification and disengagement from deteriorating credits. TrustCo has a diversified loan portfolio that includes a significant
 balance of residential mortgage loans to borrowers in the Capital Region of New York and Central Florida, and avoids concentrations to any one borrower or any single industry. TrustCo has no advances to borrowers or projects located outside the
 United States. TrustCo continues to identify delinquent loans as quickly as possible and to move promptly to resolve problem loans. Efforts to resolve delinquencies begin immediately after the payment grace period expires, with repeated,
 automatically generated notices, as well as personalized phone calls and letters. Loans are placed in nonaccrual status once they are 90 days past due, or earlier if management has determined that such classification is appropriate. Once in
 nonaccrual status, loans are either brought current and maintained current, at which point they may be returned to accrual status, or they proceed through the foreclosure process. The collateral on nonaccrual loans is evaluated periodically, and
 the loan value is written down if the collateral value is insufficient.

Index 

The Company originates loans throughout its branch franchise area. At September 30, 2024, 64.5 of its gross loan portfolio balances were in New York State and the immediately surrounding
 areas (including New Jersey, Vermont and Massachusetts), and 35.5 were in Florida. Those figures compare to 65.1 and 34.9 , respectively, at December 31, 2023.

Economic conditions vary widely by geographic location. As a percentage of the total nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024, 18.0 were to Florida borrowers, compared to 82.0 to
 borrowers in New York and surrounding areas. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, New York and surrounding areas experienced net charge-offs of approximately 180 thousand and Florida experienced net chargeoffs of 42 thousand for the
 third quarter of 2024.

Other than loans currently identified as nonperforming, management is aware of no other loans in the Bank s portfolio that pose material risk of the eventual non-collection of principal and
 interest. Also as of September 30, 2024, there were no other loans classified for regulatory purposes that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources.

Loans individually evaluated for impairment are non-accrual loans delinquent greater than 180 days, non-accrual commercial loans, as well as
 loans classified as loan modifications. There were 882 thousand of commercial mortgages and commercial loans classified as individually evaluated as of September 30, 2024 compared to 957 thousand classified as individually evaluated at
 December 31, 2023. There were 24.0 million of individually evaluated residential loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 23.6 million classified as individually evaluated at December 31, 2023 . 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s loan portfolio did not include any subprime mortgages or loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality.

At September 30, 2024 there was 2.5 million of foreclosed real estate compared to 194 thousand at December 31, 2023.

Allowance for credit losses on loans: As of September 30, 2024, the Company utilized the Baseline scenario
 model of Moody s economic scenarios and considered the uncertainty associated with the assumptions in the baseline scenario, including continued actions taken by the Federal Reserve with regard to monetary policy and interest rates and the
 potential impact of those actions, the conflicts in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine and the magnitude of the resulting market disruptions, and the potential impact of persistent high inflation on the economy. Outcomes in any or all of these
 factors could differ from the baseline scenario utilized, and the Company incorporated qualitative considerations reflecting the risk of uncertain economic conditions, and for additional dimensions of risk that may not be captured in the
 quantitative model. 

63 

Index 

In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 500 thousand, which is the result of a provision for credit losses on loans of 400 thousand, and provision for credit losses on
 unfunded commitments of 100 thousand. The increase in the ACLL during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily a result of loan growth. The increase in the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments is a result of a corresponding
 increase in unfunded loan commitments. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 100 thousand, which includes a provision for credit losses on loans of 300 thousand as a result of continued growth in
 the loan portfolio partially offset by a sustained low level of NPLs and charge-offs, and a benefit for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 200 thousand as a result of a corresponding decrease in unfunded loan commitments.

See Note 5 of the consolidated interim financial statements for additional discussion related the process for determining the provision for credit losses.

Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity

TrustCo seeks to obtain favorable sources of funding and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands. Management believes that TrustCo s earnings performance and strong
 capital position enable the Company to easily secure new sources of liquidity. The Company actively manages its liquidity through target ratios established under its liquidity policies. Continual monitoring of both historical and prospective
 ratios allows TrustCo to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. Management has also defined various degrees of adverse liquidity situations which could potentially occur and has prepared appropriate contingency plans should
 such a situation arise. As noted, the Company has a number of contingent funding alternatives available in addition to the large cash and cash equivalents position and the investment securities positions it maintains on its balance sheet. As
 previously stated, the Bank is a member of the FHLBNY and is an eligible borrower at the FRBNY and has the ability to borrow utilizing securities and/or loans as collateral at either institution. The Bank does not utilize brokered deposits as a
 part of its funding strategy, but does incorporate them as a contingent funding source within its Asset/Liability Management Policy. Like other contingent funding sources, brokered certificates of deposits may be tested from time to time to
 ensure operational and market readiness. Management believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and commitments over the next twelve months and beyond.

The Company uses an industry standard external model as the primary tool to identify, quantify and project changes in interest rates taken both from industry sources and internally generated data including
 prepayment speeds based upon historical trends in the Bank s balance sheet. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in market interest rates are also incorporated into the model. This
 model calculates an economic or fair value amount with respect to non-time deposit categories since these deposits are part of the core deposit products of the Company. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model
 cannot precisely measure the fair value of capital or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on the fair value of capital.

Using this model, the fair value of capital projections as of September 30, 2024 are referenced below. The base case (current rates) scenario shows the present estimate of the fair value of capital assuming no
 change in the operating environment or operating strategies and no change in interest rates from those existing in the marketplace as of September 30, 2024.

The following table indicates the impact on the fair value of capital assuming interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 bp, 200 bp, 300 bp and 400 bp.

Noninterest Income

Total noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.9 million compared to 4.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Financial Services income was up 417 thousand to 2.0 million in the third quarter of
 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily as a result of higher market values of assets under management. The fair value of assets under management was 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, 967 million as of December 31, 2023, and 902
 million at September 30, 2023. Fees for services to customers were down 108 thousand over the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of less interchange income.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 total noninterest income was 15.4 million, up 1.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily the result of a gain of 1.4 million recorded
 on the Visa Class C Common stock exchange as previously discussed, and an increase in financial services income due to higher market values of assets under management, partially offset by a decrease in fees for services to customers driven by
 less interchange income.

Noninterest Expenses

Total noninterest expenses were 26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Significant changes included a 259 thousand decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a 166 thousand decrease in equipment expense, a 169 thousand decrease in outsourced services, a 247 decrease in advertising expense, and a 553 thousand
 decrease in other expense, partially offset by a 146 thousand increase in professional service. Full time equivalent headcount was 764 as of September 30, 2023, 750 as of December 31, 2023, and 735 as of September 30, 2024. Changes in headcount
 represent normal fluctuations.

Total noninterest expenses were 77.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 82.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Significant changes included an decrease of 2.7 million in salaries and employee benefits primarily as a result of fewer employees and lower employee benefits. Other significant changes were a decrease in
 equipment expense of 273 thousand, a decrease in advertising expense of 281 thousand, a decrease in other expense of 1.7 million, a decrease in FDIC and other insurance of 212 thousand, and a decrease in other real estate expense, net, of
 242 thousand partially offset by an increase in professional services of 209 thousand and an increase in outsourced services of 300 thousand. 

Income Taxes

In the third quarter of 2024, TrustCo recognized income tax expense of 4.0 million compared to 4.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates were 23.8 and 23.7 for the third quarters of
 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the first nine months, income taxes were 11.7 million and 15.9 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was 23.8 and 24.6 for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Capital Resources

Consistent with its long-term goal of operating a sound and profitable financial organization, TrustCo strives to maintain strong capital ratios.

66 

Index 

Banking regulators have moved towards higher required capital requirements due to the standards included in the Basel III banking capital reform measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
 Protection Act, as well as a general trend towards reducing risk in the banking system by providing a greater capital margin.

Total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 669.0 million compared to 645.3 million at December 31, 2023. TrustCo declared a dividend of 0.36 per share in the third quarter of
 2024. This results in a dividend payout ratio of 53.16 based on third quarter 2024 earnings of 12.9 million.

The capital rules, which are generally applicable to both the Company and the Bank, include several measures; specifically, a Tier 1 leverage ratio, a common equity tier 1 CET1 capital
 ratio, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a total risk-based capital ratio. The rules also impose a capital conservation buffer that requires the Company and the Bank to maintain additional levels of Tier 1 common equity over the minimum
 risk-based capital levels before they may pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.

The September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based, and total risk-based capital ratios include a capital conservation buffer of 2.50 percent

In addition, at September 30, 2024, the consolidated equity to total assets ratio was 10.95 , compared to 10.46 at December 31, 2023 and 10.31 at September 30, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, the capital levels of both TrustCo and the Bank exceeded the minimum standards, including with the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer taken into account.

Under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency s OCC prompt corrective action regulations, a bank is deemed to be well capitalized when its CET1, Tier 1, total risk-based and leverage capital ratios
 are at least 7 , 8.5 , 10.5 and 5 , respectively. A bank is deemed to be adequately capitalized or better if its capital ratios meet or exceed the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements, and undercapitalized if it fails to meet
 these minimal capital requirements. A bank is significantly undercapitalized if its CET1, Tier 1, total risk-based and leverage capital ratios fall below 3 , 4 , 6 and 3 , respectively and critically undercapitalized if the institution has
 a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2 . At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Trustco Bank met the definition of well capitalized. 

68 

Index 

As noted, the Company s dividend payout ratio was 53.16 of net income for the third quarter of 2024 and 46.65 of net income for the third quarter of 2023. The per-share dividend paid in the third quarter of 2024
 and 2023 was 0.36 for both years. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. The payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company is subject to continued
 compliance with minimum regulatory capital requirements. The OCC may disapprove a dividend if the Bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution; the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or the capital
 distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.

TrustCo maintains a dividend reinvestment plan DRP with approximately 6,416 participants. The DRP allows participants to reinvest dividends in shares of the Company. The DRP also allows for additional purchases
 by participants and has a discount feature (up to a 5 for safe harbor provisions) that can be activated by management as a tool to raise capital. To date, the discount feature has not been utilized.

Share Repurchase Program

On March 29, 2024 the Company s Board of Directors authorized, and the Company announced, another share repurchase program of up to 200,000 shares, or approximately 1 of its currently outstanding common stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 14,000 shares at an average price per share of 26.68 for a total of 374,000 under its Board authorized share repurchase program. There were no share
 repurchases during the third quarter of 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make
 estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, income taxes and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ
 from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in the financial statements contained in the 2023 Form 10-K other
 than what is set forth immediately below.

Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy given the measurement uncertainty and subjective judgement necessary in evaluating the
 levels of the allowance required to cover the life-time losses in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations.

I. DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY:

INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL

The following table summarizes the component distribution of the average balance sheet, related interest income and expense and the average annualized yields on interest earning assets and
 annualized rates on interest bearing liabilities of TrustCo (adjusted for tax equivalency) for each of the reported periods. Nonaccrual loans are included in loans for this analysis. The average balances of securities available for sale and
 held to maturity are calculated using amortized costs for these securities. Included in the average balance of shareholders equity is the unrealized loss, net of tax, in the available for sale portfolio of 32.3 million in 2024 and 33.1
 million in 2023. The subtotals contained in the following table are the arithmetic totals of the items contained in that category. Increases and decreases in interest income and expense due to both rate and volume have been allocated to the
 categories of variances (volume and rate) based on the percentage relationship of such variances to each other.

Item 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The information presented in the Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity section of Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.

As detailed in the Annual Report to Shareholders as of December 31, 2023, the Company is subject to interest rate risk as its principal market risk. As noted in the Management s Discussion and Analysis for the
 three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company continues to respond to changes in interest rates in such a way that positions the Company to meet short-term earning goals and also allows the Company to respond
 to changes in interest rates in the future. Consequently, for the third quarter of 2024, the Company had an average balance of Federal Funds sold and other short-term investments of 465.9 million compared to 494.6 million in the third quarter
 of 2023. As investment opportunities present themselves, management plans to invest funds from the Federal Funds sold and other short-term investment portfolio into the securities available for sale, securities held to maturity and loan
 portfolios. TrustCo does not engage in activities involving interest rate swaps, forward placement contracts, or any other instruments commonly referred to as derivatives. As noted, additional disclosure of interest rate risk can be found
 under Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity and Asset/Liability Management in the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of this document.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
 that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. An evaluation was carried out under the
 supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
 this report. Based upon this evaluation of those disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s
 disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
 of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Further, no evaluation of a cost-effective system of
 controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be detected.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings

The nature of TrustCo s business generates a certain amount of litigation against TrustCo and its subsidiaries involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management of TrustCo,
 there are no proceedings pending to which TrustCo or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which its property is the subject which, if determined adversely to TrustCo or such subsidiaries, would be material in relation to TrustCo s
 consolidated shareholders equity and financial condition.

Item 1A. 

Risk Factors

An investment in the Company involves risks, including the risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, which risk factors have not materially changed except as set forth below. The
 risk factors below supersede the similarly captioned risk factors set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K and supplement the other risk factors in the 2023 Form 10-K. The risk factors below reflect modifications to the nature of the risks that have
 developed since the date on which the 2023 Form 10-K was filed.

Changes in interest rates may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations

Like other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments, and interest
 paid on deposits and borrowings. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such
 assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy,
 competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the FRB (the FOMC ), and market interest rates.

Over any specific period of time, our interest-earning assets may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-bearing liabilities, or vice-versa. In addition, the individual market
 interest rates underlying our loan and deposit products may not change to the same degree over a given time period. In any event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, earnings may be negatively affected. The FOMC
 increased the target range for the Federal Funds rate eleven times in 2022 and 2023, by a total of 525 basis points, to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 , then lowered it in September 2024 by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . In its August
 2024 Beige Book , the FRB noted that economic activity grew slightly in three districts, while the number of districts that reported flat or declining activity rose from five in the prior period to nine in the current period. Regional
 small-to-medium-sized banks in second district (where the Company s New York branches are located) reported no change in loan demand, though demand for refinancing picked up from low levels. Economic activity in the sixth district (where the
 Company s Florida branches are located) declined slightly since the prior report, and loan volumes grew slowly in the sixth district.

73 

Index 

There can be no assurances as to any future FOMC conduct. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates likely will rise, which will positively impact our interest income
 but may further negatively impact the entire national economy, including the housing industry in the markets we serve, by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our
 operational costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates (or,
 if adjustable, are initially fixed for periods of five to 10 years) and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than
 the rates we earn on loans.

We also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Increases in interest rates may
 decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to
 reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable
 to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. Conversely, increases in interest rates often result in slowed prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, reducing cash flows and reinvestment opportunities.

Changes in interest rates also affect the value of the Bank s interest-earning assets, and in particular the Bank s securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with
 changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest
 rates could have an adverse effect on shareholders equity.
