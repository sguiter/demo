 Available-for-Sale Investment Securities: The fair values used by Peoples are obtained from an independent pricing service and represent either quoted market prices for the identical securities (Level 1) or fair values determined by pricing models using a market approach that considers observable market data, such as interest rate volatility, secured overnight funding rate ("SOFR") (or other relevant) yield curves, credit spreads and prices from market makers and live trading systems (Level 2). Management reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized by the pricing services or broker in management's overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided, and challenges prices when management believes a material discrepancy in pricing exists. 
 Equity Investment Securities: The fair values of Peoples' equity investment securities are obtained from q uoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) or quoted prices in less active markets (Level 2). 
 Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities : Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are recognized on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value within "Other assets" and "Accrued expenses and other liabilities", respectively. The fair value for derivative financial instruments is determined based on market prices, broker-dealer quotations on similar products, or other related input parameters (Level 2).

 Collateral Dependent Loans: Loans for which repayment is dependent upon the operation or sale of collateral, as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, are considered collateral dependent. Peoples utilizes outside third-party appraisal services to value the underlying collateral, which Peoples then uses to report the loans at their fair value (Level 3). 
 Loans Held for Sale: Loans originated and intended to be sold in the secondary market, generally one-to-four family residential loans, are carried, in aggregate, at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Peoples uses a valuation model using quoted market prices of similar instruments in arriving at the fair value (Level 2). 
 Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO"): OREO, included in "Other assets" on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets, is comprised primarily of commercial and residential real estate properties acquired by Peoples in satisfaction of a loan. OREO obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. The carrying value of OREO is not re-measured to fair value on a recurring basis, but is based on recent real estate appraisals and is updated at least annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches, including the comparable sales approach and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available (Level 3).

 For certain financial assets and liabilities, carrying value approximates fair value due to the nature of the financial instrument. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and overnight borrowings. Peoples used the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of the following financial instruments: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, balances due from other banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents balances are a reasonable estimate of fair value (Level 1). 
 Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities: The fair values used by Peoples are obtained from an independent pricing service and represent fair values determined by pricing models using a market approach that considers observable market data, such as interest rate volatility, relevant yield curves, credit spreads and prices from market makers and live trading systems (Level 2). When observable market data is absent, the independent pricing service estimates prices based on underlying cash flow characteristics and discount rates and compares them to similar securities (Level 3).

 Management evaluates available-for-sale investment securities for an allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2024, management concluded that no individual securities at an unrealized loss position required an allowance for credit losses. At September 30, 2024, Peoples did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that Peoples would be required to sell, any of the securities with an unrealized loss prior to recovery. Further, the unrealized losses at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were attributable to changes in market interest rates and spreads since the securities were purchased, and were not credit-related losses. 
 The unrealized loss with respect to the bank-issued trust preferred securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more at September 30, 2024 was attributable to the subordinated nature of the trust preferred securities.

 Management evaluates held-to-maturity investment securities for an allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Peoples has determined that the loss given default for U.S. government sponsored agencies investment securities is , due to the fact that it is unlikely the ultimate guarantor (the U.S. government) would not perform on its implicit guarantee in the event of default. The remaining securities are included in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity investment securities. Peoples reported million of allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 (a) There were million of nonaccrual loans for which there was no allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and million of nonaccrual loans for which there was no allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, nonaccrual loans increased compared to at December 31, 2023, which was primarily due to large leases totaling million and commercial real estate loans of approximately million that went on nonaccrual status during 2024. The increase in accruing loans 90+ days past due at September 30, 2024, when compared to at December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in leases that were 90+ days past due and accruing of million, which was administrative in nature, an increase in premium finance loans loans of approximately million, and an increase in commercial real estate loans of approximately million. The increase in past due premium finance loans carry low credit risk, due to the ability to cancel premiums and recover the majority of the receivable from the insurer. 
 The amount of interest income recognized on accruing loans 90+ days past due during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 As discussed in "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Peoples' 2023 Form 10-K, Peoples categorizes the majority of its loans into risk categories based upon an established risk grading matrix using a scale of 1 to 8. Loan grades are assigned at the time a new loan or lending commitment is extended by Peoples and may be changed at any time when circumstances warrant. Commercial loans to borrowers with an aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of million are reviewed at least on an annual basis for possible credit deterioration. Commercial leases, as well as loan relationships whose aggregate credit exposure to Peoples is equal to or less than million, are reviewed on an event driven basis. Triggers for review include knowledge of adverse events affecting the borrower's business, receipt of financial statements indicating deteriorating credit quality or other similar events. Adversely classified loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades used by Peoples, follows: 
 Pass (grades 1 through 4): Loans in this risk category involve borrowers of acceptable-to-strong credit quality and risk who have the apparent ability to satisfy their loan obligations. Loans in this risk category would possess sufficient mitigating factors, such as adequate collateral or strong guarantors possessing the capacity to repay the loan if required, for any weakness that may exist.

 Premium finance Leases Commercial and industrial Residential real estate Total collateral dependent loans 
 The increase in collateral dependent loans at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the addition of leases associated with customer relationships and premium finance loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 As part of Peoples' loss mitigation activities, Peoples may agree to modify the contractual terms of a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The most common modifications to the contractual terms of a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty include an extension of the maturity date, a reduction in the interest rate for the remaining life of the loan, a temporary period of interest-only payments, and a reduction in the contractual payment amount for either a short period or the remaining term of the loan. 
 In addition to loan modifications, Peoples also provides other loss mitigation options, such as forbearance and repayment plans, to assist borrowers who experience financial difficulties. In assessing whether or not a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, Peoples considers information currently available regarding the financial condition of the borrower. This information includes, but is not limited to, whether (1) the borrower is currently in payment default on any of the borrower's debt; (2) a payment default is probable in the foreseeable future without the modification; (3) the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; and (4) the borrower's projected cash flow is insufficient to satisfy contractual payments due under the original terms of the loan without a modification.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 As discussed in "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Peoples' 2023 Form 10-K, Peoples estimates the allowance for credit losses using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In management's estimation of expected credit losses, Peoples uses a one-year reasonable and supportable period across all segments. Following the reasonable and supportable period, Peoples reverts the macroeconomic variables to their long run average over a four-quarter reversion period.

 During the third quarter of 2024, Peoples recorded a total provision for credit losses of million, which was a result of higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 were million, primarily driven by an increase in charge-offs on leases originated by our North Star Leasing division, partially offset by recoveries of other commercial real estate loans.The increase in the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 when compared to at June 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase on reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, Peoples recorded a provision for credit losses of million, which was driven by (i) loan growth, (ii) an increase in net charge-offs, (iii) updates to our prepayment, curtailment, and funding rates, and (iv) a deterioration in macro-economic conditions used within the CECL mode, partially offset by the release of reserves on individually analyzed loans. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2023 also included an allowance for loans that were not considered purchased credit deteriorated acquired in the Limestone merger. 
 The provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024 was million, compared to a provision for credit losses of million for the first nine months of 2023. The provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024 was mainly a result of (i) higher net charge-offs, (ii) an increase in reserves on individually analyzed loans and leases, (iii) economic forecast deterioration and (iv) loan growth. The provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2023 was driven by (i) the addition of the provision for the non-purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired in the Limestone Merger, (ii) loan growth and (iii) economic forecast deterioration, partially offset by a reduction in the reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases and the use of updated loss drivers. 
 Peoples had recorded an allowance for unfunded commitments of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for unfunded commitments (also referred to as "unfunded commitment liability") is presented in the Accrued expenses and other liabilities line of the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in the allowance for unfunded commitments is also reflected in the "Provision for (recovery of) credit losses" line of the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 These forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations based on all information available to management and its knowledge of Peoples' business and operations. Additionally, Peoples' financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 
 (1) the effects of interest rate policies, changes in the interest rate environment due to economic conditions and/or the fiscal and monetary policy measures undertaken by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve Board, including changes in the Federal Funds Target Rate, in response to such economic conditions, which may adversely impact interest rates, the interest rate yield curve, interest margins, loan demand and interest rate sensitivity; 
 (2) the effects of inflationary pressures on borrowers liquidity and ability to repay; 
 (3) the success, impact, and timing of the implementation of Peoples' business strategies and Peoples' ability to manage strategic initiatives, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board, the completion and successful integration of acquisitions, and the expansion of commercial and consumer lending activities; 
 (4) competitive pressures among financial institutions, or from non-financial institutions, which may increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures, which can in turn impact Peoples' credit spreads, changes to third-party relationships and revenues, changes in the manner of providing services, customer acquisition and retention pressures, and Peoples' ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professionals; 
 (5) uncertainty regarding the nature, timing, cost, and effect of legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or deposit insurance premium levels, promulgated and to be promulgated by governmental and regulatory agencies in the State of Ohio, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may subject Peoples, its subsidiaries, or one or more acquired companies to a variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory requirements; 
 (6) the effects of easing restrictions on participants in the financial services industry; 
 (7) current and future local, regional, national and international economic conditions (including the impact of persistent inflation, supply chain issues or labor shortages, supply-demand imbalances affecting local real estate prices, high unemployment rates in the local or regional economies in which Peoples operates and/or the U.S. economy generally, an increasing federal government budget deficit, the failure of the federal government to raise the federal debt ceiling, potential or imposed tariffs, uncertainties surrounding the upcoming U.S. Presidential election and potential changes in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars and other changes in trade regulations, and changes in the relationship of the U.S. and U.S. global trading partners) and the impact these conditions may have on Peoples, Peoples' customers and Peoples' counterparties, and Peoples' assessment of the impact, which may be different than anticipated; 
 (8) Peoples may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to Peoples' current shareholders; 
 (9) changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, levels of nonperforming assets, delinquent loans, charge-offs, and customer and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness generally, which may be less favorable than expected in light of recent inflationary pressures and continued elevated interest rates, and may adversely impact the amount of interest income generated; 
 (10) Peoples may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent there are loan concentrations by location or industry of borrowers or collateral; 
 (11) future credit quality and performance, including expectations regarding future credit losses and the allowance for credit losses;

 Summary of Recent Transactions and Events 
 The following is a summary of recent transactions and events that have impacted or are expected to impact Peoples results of operations or financial condition: 
 For the first nine months of 2024, Peoples incurred (0.7) million of acquisition-related expenses compared to 15.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. Peoples recorded acquisition-related expenses, primarily related to the Limestone Merger, which included (0.7) million for the third quarter of 2024 and 4.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, Peoples recorded a provision for credit losses of 6.7 million, compared to a provision for credit losses of 5.7 million for the linked quarter and a provision for credit losses of 4.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, Peoples recorded a provision for credit losses of 18.5 million, compared to a provision for credit losses of 13.9 million for 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly a result of net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024 was mainly a result of (i) higher net charge-offs, (ii) an increase in reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases, (iii) economic forecast deterioration and (iv) loan growth. For more information, please refer to the section titled "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Provision for Credit Losses" found later in this MD A. 
 On October 25, 2022, Peoples announced the Limestone Merger, a transaction valued at 177.9 million. The Limestone Merger closed as of the close of business on April 30, 2023. Peoples acquired Limestone's loan portfolio totaling 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion of deposits, 172.7 million of total investment securities, an aggregate of 99.5 million of short-term and long-term borrowings, and 93.5 million of total cash and cash equivalents. Peoples also recorded goodwill in the amount of 68.8 million and other intangible assets of 27.7 million, which consisted of core deposit intangibles. 
 To combat the effects of ongoing inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve Board increased the Federal Funds Target Rate range to 0.25 to 0.50 beginning on March 16, 2022, and continued to raise rates up to 5.50 on July 27, 2023. This rate remained unchanged until September 2024, at which point the Federal Reserve Board decreased rates by 50 basis points, reducing the rate to 4.75 to 5.00 . The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that future rate reductions continue to be a possibility. 
 The impact of these transactions and events, where material, is discussed in the applicable sections of this MD A. 
 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Peoples reported net income of 31.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, representing earnings per diluted common share of 0.89. In comparison, Peoples reported net income of 29.0 million, representing earnings per diluted common share of 0.82, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of 31.9 million, representing earnings per diluted common share of 0.90, for the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Peoples recorded net income of 90.3 million, or 2.55 per diluted common share, compared to 79.5 million, or 2.47 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-core items negatively impacted earnings per diluted common share by 0.01 for the third quarter of 2024, 0.02 for the second quarter of 2024, and 0.16 for the third quarter of 2023. Non-core items negatively impacted earnings per diluted share by 0.03 and 0.52 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net interest income was 88.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, and increased 2.3 million when compared to the linked quarter. Net interest margin was 4.27 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.18 for the linked quarter. The increase in net interest income and net interest margin was primarily driven by an increase in accretion income, net of amortization, from our acquisitions and higher earning asset yields, which were partially offset by higher borrowings costs. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 4.4 million, or 5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income compared to the third quarter of 2023 was driven by higher funding costs. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.27 and decreased 43 basis points compared to 4.70 for the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by an increase in interest expense on deposits. For the first nine months of 2024, net interest income increased 11.2 million, or 4 , compared to the first nine months of 2023, while net interest margin decreased 36 basis points to 4.24 . The increase in net interest income was driven by increases in market interest rates and an additional four months of income from the Limestone Merger. The decrease in net interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by higher borrowing costs, which offset higher earning asset yields. 
 Accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions was 8.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, 5.8 million for the second quarter of 2024 and 9.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, which added 39 basis points, 28 basis points and 48 basis points, respectively, to net interest margin. The increase in accretion income for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the linked quarter was driven by higher pay-offs. The decrease in accretion income for the current quarter compared to the third quarter of 2023

 was a result of the accretion from the Limestone Merger. Accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions was 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which added 33 and 29 basis points, respectively, to net interest margin. The increase in accretion income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was due to more accretion from the Limestone Merger. 
 The provision for credit losses was 6.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of 5.7 million for the linked quarter and a provision for credit losses of 4.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly a result of net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024 was driven by (i) higher charge-offs, (ii) an increase of reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases, and (iii) loan growth. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2023 was driven by (i) loan growth, (ii) an increase in net charge-offs, (iii) updates to our prepayment, curtailment and funding rates, and (iv) a deterioration in macro-economic conditions used within the CECL model, partially offset by the release of reserves on individually analyzed loans. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 were 6.1 million, or 0.38 of average total loans annualized, compared to net charge-offs of 4.2 million, or 0.27 of average total loans annualized, for the linked quarter and net charge-offs of 2.3 million, or 0.15 of average total loans annualized, for the third quarter of 2023. For additional information on credit trends and the allowance for credit losses, see the "FINANCIAL CONDITION - Allowance for Credit Losses" section below. 
 The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 was 18.5 million, compared to 13.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 was mainly the result of (i) higher net charge-offs, (ii) an increase in reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases and (iii) economic forecast deterioration and (iv) loan growth. The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2023 was driven by (i) the addition of the provision for the non-purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired in the Limestone Merger, (ii) loan growth and (iii) economic forecast deterioration, partially offset by a reduction in the reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases and the use of updated loss drivers. Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 were 13.6 million, or 0.29 of average total loans annualized, compared to net charge-offs of 5.1 million, or 0.12 of average total loans annualized, for the first nine months of 2023. For additional information on credit trends and the allowance for credit losses, see the "FINANCIAL CONDITION - Allowance for Credit Losses" section below. 
 Net gains and losses include gains and losses on investment securities, asset disposals and other transactions, which are included in total non-interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net loss realized during the third quarter of 2024 was 0.9 million, compared to a net loss of 0.8 million for the linked quarter and a net loss of 0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The net loss for the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024, and the third quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by net losses on repossessed assets of 0.5 million, 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively. The net loss realized during the first nine months of 2024 was 2.0 million, compared to 4.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. The net loss for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by 1.3 million of net losses on repossessed assets. The net loss for the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by a 2.0 million pre-tax net loss on the sale of available-for-sale investment securities and the 1.6 million writedown of an OREO property. During the first nine months of 2024, Peoples sold 96.7 million of it's lower yielding available-for-sale investment securities, with proceeds from the sale used to pay down overnight borrowings. 
 Total non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses, for the third quarter of 2024 increased 1.2 million compared to the linked quarter. The increase in non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses, was primarily impacted by increases of 0.8 million in mortgage banking income and 0.7 million in lease income, partially offset by a decrease of 0.6 million in bank-owned life insurance income ("BOLI"). Compared to the third quarter of 2023, total non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses, increased 2.1 million, primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in lease income, a 0.8 million increase in mortgage banking income, and a 0.6 million increase in trust and investment income, partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in BOLI income. The increases for the third quarter of 2024, when compared to the third quarter of 2023, were primarily due to gains on early terminations on leases that paid off, higher production in mortgage banking, and an increase in trust and investment income driven by an increase in assets under administration and management. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, total non-interest income, excluding gains and losses, increased 8.7 million, or 13 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was driven by (i) a 2.0 million increase in other non-interest income, driven by operating lease income, (ii) a 1.7 million increase in trust and investment income driven by increases in assets under administration and management, (iii) a 1.4 million increase in lease income driven by gains on terminated leases, (iv) a 1.2 million increase in insurance income driven by higher contingency income and market increases for premiums, (v) a 0.9 million increase in deposit account service charge income, and (vi) a 0.9 million increase in mortgage banking income. 
 Total non-interest expense decreased 2.7 million, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the linked quarter. The decrease in total non-interest expense was primarily due to decreases of 2.9 million in other non-interest expense, driven by a one-time 1.3 million true-up of corporate expenses recorded in the linked quarter, and a decrease of 0.6 million in data processing and software expense. 
 Compared to the third quarter of 2023, total non-interest expense decreased 5.6 million, or 8 . The decrease in total non-interest expense was primarily due to acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, non-

 interest expenses decreased 0.5 million, or 1 , primarily due to a decrease of 2.7 million in other non-interest expense, partially offset by an increase of 1.1 million in data processing and software expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense increased 4.5 million, or 2 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, non-interest expenses increased 21.0 million, or 11 , primarily due to increases of 11.6 million in salaries and employee benefit costs due to additional employees added in the Limestone Merger, 4.4 million and 2.5 million in data processing and software expense and in net occupancy and equipment expense, respectively, due to recent technology projects and growth, including through acquisitions. 
 The table below summarizes the amount of acquisition-related expenses for each line item that is a component of non-interest expense. This information is used by Peoples to provide information useful to investors in understanding Peoples' operating performance and trends.

 The efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 55.1 , compared to 59.2 for the linked quarter, and 58.4 for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio, adjusted for non-core items, was 55.7 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 59.2 for the linked quarter and 52.5 for the third quarter of 2023. The efficiency ratio and the adjusted efficiency ratio for non-core items improved compared to the linked quarterly mainly as a result of a reduction in non-interest expense and an increase in net interest income. The efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2024 was 57.4 , compared to 59.7 for the first nine months of 2023. The efficiency ratio improved compared to the prior year first nine months due to the decrease in acquisition-related expenses. The efficiency ratio, adjusted for non-core items, was 57.7 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 54.2 for the first nine months of 2023. Peoples continues to focus on controlling expenses, while recognizing necessary costs in order to continue growing the business. 
 Peoples recorded income tax expense of 9.2 million with an effective tax rate of 22.5 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to income tax expense of 6.9 million with an effective tax rate of 19.1 for the linked quarter, and income tax expense of 8.8 million with an effective tax rate of 21.7 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter was driven by a 1.1 million one-time benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2024 related to a prior year amended return and higher pre-tax income. Peoples recorded income tax expense of 24.3 million with an effective tax rate of 21.2 for the first nine months of 2024 and 22.1 million with an effective tax rate of 21.7 for the first nine months of 2023.

 At September 30, 2024, total assets were 9.14 billion, compared to 9.23 billion at June 30, 2024, 9.16 billion at December 31, 2023 and 8.94 billion at September 30, 2023. Total assets at September 30, 2024 decreased when compared to at June 30, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in loans and investment securities, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The period-end total loan and lease balances at September 30, 2024 decreased 53.5 million, or 3 annualized, compared to at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the period-end total loan and lease balances was primarily driven by decreases of (i) 20.5 million in construction loans, (ii) 15.5 million in other commercial real estate loans, (iii) 11.8 million in residential real estate loans, and (iv) 7.9 million in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by an increase of 5.5 million in home equity lines of credit. Total assets at September 30, 2024 decreased compared to December 31, 2023 due to a decrease of 143.0 million in total cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase of 112.6 million in loans and leases. Total assets at September 30, 2024 increased compared to September 30, 2023 due to an increase of 187.4 million in total loans and leases. The period-end loan and lease increased from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of organic growth in our commercial and industrial, premium finance, and lease portfolios of 121.3 million, 97.7million, and 30.4 million, respectively. 
 Total liabilities were 8.02 billion at September 30, 2024, down from 8.15 billion at June 30, 2024 and 8.10 billion at December 31, 2023, and up from 7.95 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease in total liabilities when compared to at June 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of 306.8 million in short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase of 185.4 million in period-end total deposits. The decrease in total liabilities when compared to at December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease of 425.2 million in short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase of 330.9 million in total period end deposits. The increase in total liabilities when compared to at September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 445.6 million increase in period in deposits, partially offset by a decrease of 409.5 million in short-term borrowings. The increase in deposits was primarily driven by increases of 685.4 million in retail certificates of deposit, 163.8 million in money market deposit accounts, and 62.5 million in governmental deposit accounts, partially offset by decreases of 122.2 million, 115.6 million, 115.2 million, and 113.0 million in savings accounts, non-interest bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and brokered certificates of deposit, respectively. The increase in retail certificates of deposits was driven by current promotional offerings. 
 Total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 increased by 47.1 million compared to at June 30, 2024, which was primarily due to net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 31.7 million and a decrease of 27.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by dividends paid of 14.2 million. Accumulated unrealized losses related to the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were 83.7 million and 112.7 million at September 30, 2024 and at June 30, 2024, respectively. Total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 increased by 71.6 million compared to at December 31, 2023, which was primarily due to net income of 90.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 and a decrease of 19.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by dividends paid of 42.1 million. The increase in total stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 when compared to at September 30, 2023 was impacted by net income of 124.1 million in the last twelve months and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 61.3 million, partially offset by dividends paid of 56.2 million.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense, remains Peoples' largest source of revenue. The amount of net interest income earned by Peoples each quarter is affected by various factors, including changes in market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve s monetary policy, the level and degree of pricing competition for loans and deposits in Peoples markets, and the amount and composition of Peoples' earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Net interest margin, which is calculated by dividing fully tax-equivalent ("FTE") net interest income by average interest-earning assets, serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the volume, mix and pricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. FTE net interest income is calculated by increasing interest income to convert tax-exempt income earned on obligations of states and political subdivisions and tax-exempt loans to the pre-tax equivalent of taxable income using a federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The following table details the calculation of FTE net interest income:

Table of Contents 

 interest income and net interest margin was primarily driven by an increase in accretion income, net of amortization, from acquisitions and higher borrowing costs, which offset higher earning asset yields. 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5 over the prior year quarter and net interest margin decreased by 43 basis points. The decrease in net interest income compared to the third quarter of 2023 was driven by higher funding costs. The decrease in net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, was driven primarily by an increase in interest rates on deposits. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, net interest income increased 11.2 million, or 4 , compared to the first nine months of 2023, while net interest margin decreased 36 basis points to 4.24 . The increase in net interest income was driven by increases in market interest rates and an additional four months of income from the Limestone Merger. The decrease in net interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by the full year impact of assets added in the Limestone Merger, which offset higher earning asset yields. 
 Accretion income, net of amortization expense, from acquisitions was 8.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, 5.8 million for the linked quarter and 9.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, which added 39 basis points, 28 basis points and 48 basis points, respectively, to net interest margin. The increase in accretion income for the third quarter of 2024, when compared to the linked quarter was driven by higher payoffs. The decrease in accretion income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was a result of lower accretion from the Limestone Merger. For the first nine months of 2024, accretion income totaled 20.3 million and added 33 basis points to net interest margin compared to 15.8 million and 29 basis points for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in accretion income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was due to more accretion from the Limestone Merger.

 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Provision for other credit losses 6,279 5,397 3,764 17,510 13,188 Provision for checking account overdraft credit losses 456 286 289 1,010 701 Provision for credit losses 6,735 5,683 4,053 18,520 13,889 
 The provision for credit losses recorded represents the amount needed to maintain the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses based on management s quarterly estimates. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly a result of net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024 was driven by (i) higher net charge-offs, (ii) an increase of reserves on individually analyzed loans and leases and (iii) loan growth. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2023 was driven by (i) loan growth, (ii) an increase in net charge-offs, (iii) updates to our prepayment, curtailment, and funding rates, and (iv) a deterioration in macro-economic conditions used within the CECL model, partially offset by a release of reserves on individually analyzed loans. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the provision for credit losses was mainly the result of (i) higher net charge-offs, (ii) an increase of reserves on individually analyzed loans and leases and (iii) economic forecast deterioration and (iv) loan growth. For the first nine months of 2023, the provision for credit losses was driven by (i) the addition of the provision for the non-purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired in the Limestone Merger, (ii) loan growth and (iii) economic forecast deterioration, partially offset by a reduction in the reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases and the use of updated loss drivers. 
 Additional information regarding changes in the allowance for credit losses and loan credit quality can be found later in this MD A under the caption FINANCIAL CONDITION - Allowance for Credit Losses.

 Net Loss Included in Total Non-Interest Income 
 Net loss includes net losses on investment securities, asset disposals and other transactions, which are recognized in total non-interest income. The following table details Peoples net losses for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net loss on investment securities (74) (353) (7) (428) (2,108) Net loss on asset disposals and other transactions: 
 Net loss on other assets (764) (397) (284) (1,470) (557) Net loss on OREO (2) (2) (1,623) Net loss on other transactions (29) (31) (23) (92) (38) Net loss on asset disposals and other transactions (795) (428) (307) (1,564) (2,218) 
 The net loss on investment securities for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the loss recorded on a contingent call of a security. During the first quarter of 2023, Peoples executed sales of 96.7 million of its lower yielding available-for-sale securities which were used to pay down overnight borrowings. The loss on the sales of the available-for-sale investment securities had a nominal impact on tangible book value as such loss was previously reflected in capital through accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 The net loss on assets disposals and other transactions for the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024, and the third quarter of 2023 were driven primarily by net losses on repossessed assets of 0.5 million, 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Total Non-Interest Income, Excluding Net Gains and Losses 
 Total non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses, comprised 22 of Peoples' total revenues (defined as net interest income plus total non-interest income excluding net gains and losses) for the third quarter of 2024, 22 for the linked quarter, and 20 for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, total non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses, totaled 23 of total revenues compared to 21 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, electronic banking income comprised the largest portion of Peoples' total non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses. Peoples' electronic banking ("e-banking") services include ATM and debit cards, direct deposit services, internet and mobile banking, and remote deposit capture, and serve as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to customers. The following table details Peoples' e-banking income: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 E-banking income 6,359 6,470 6,466 18,875 18,375 
 Peoples' e-banking income is derived largely from ATM and debit cards, as other services are mainly provided at no charge to customers. The amount of e-banking income is largely dependent on the timing and volume of customer activity. E-banking income increased for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by an increase in customer activity. 
 The following table details Peoples' insurance income: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Property and casualty insurance commissions

 Peoples' trust and investment income, which includes fiduciary income, brokerage income, and employee benefit fees, continued to be based primarily upon the value of assets under administration and management, with additional income generated from transaction commissions, cross-selling of products and additional retirement plan services business. The following table details Peoples trust and investment income: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Fiduciary income 2,047 2,212 1,835 6,260 5,686 Brokerage income 2,044 1,989 1,782 5,875 5,076 Employee benefit fees 791 798 671 2,345 2,024 Trust and investment income 4,882 4,999 4,288 14,480 12,786 
 Fiduciary income and brokerage income decreased in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the linked quarter due to market performance. When compared to the third quarter of 2023, fiduciary income and brokerage income increased 0.5 million, which was driven by an increase in assets under administration and management. For the first nine months of 2024, trust and investment income increased when compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher fiduciary and brokerage income, primarily reflecting an increase in assets under management and market volatility. 
 The following table details Peoples' assets under administration and management: 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Trust 2,124,320 2,071,832 2,061,402 2,021,249 1,900,488 Brokerage

 The increases in assets under administration and management at September 30, 2024 compared to at June 30, 2024 were driven by market value fluctuations. The increases in assets under administration and management at September 30, 2024 when compared to at September 30, 2023 were primarily due to recent growth, through acquisitions, as Peoples added new accounts and the underlying market values of assets under management grew. 
 Deposit account service charges are based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided. The following table details Peoples' deposit account service charges: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees 2,455 2,288 2,461 6,998 6,579 Account maintenance fees 1,741 1,716 1,577 5,175 4,661 Other fees and charges 324 335 478 909 952 Deposit account service charges 4,520 4,339 4,516 13,082 12,192 
 The amount of deposit account service charges, particularly fees for overdrafts and non-sufficient funds, is largely dependent on the timing and volume of customer activity. Management periodically evaluates its cost recovery fees to ensure they are reasonable based on operational costs and similar to fees charged in Peoples' markets by competitors. Deposit account service charges increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter due to seasonality of customer activity. Deposit account service charges were flat when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023. Deposit account service charges also increased for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 due to the Limestone Merger.

 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Other non-interest income 2,293 2,172 2,452 6,163 4,179 Bank owned life insurance income 460 1,037 1,375 2,997 2,924 Lease income 1,827 1,116 (66) 4,179 2,730 Mortgage banking income 1,051 243 237 1,615 740 
 Other non-interest income was relatively flat for the three months ended September 30,2024 when compared to the linked quarter and the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other non-interest income for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023 was driven by increased operating lease income. 
 Bank owned life insurance income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased compared to the linked quarter and the prior year quarter primarily due changes in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies. Bank owned life insurance income for the first nine months of 2024 remained relatively flat when compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Lease income is primarily comprised of (i) gains on the early termination of leases, net of any associated purchase accounting adjustments, (ii) month-to-month lease payments in excess of net investment in the lease, net of any associated purchase accounting adjustment, (iii) fees received for referrals, (iv) gains and losses recognized on the sales of residual assets, net of any purchase accounting impact, and (v) syndication income. Lease income for the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the linked quarter and the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in gains on terminated leases. Lease income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in gains on early terminations on leases that paid off. 
 Mortgage banking income is comprised mostly of net gains from the origination and sale of real estate loans in the secondary market, and, to a lesser extent, servicing income for loans sold with servicing retained. As a result, the amount of income recognized by Peoples is largely dependent on customer demand and long-term interest rates for residential real estate loans offered in the secondary market. Mortgage banking income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.8 million when compared to each of the prior periods and was primarily driven by higher production. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, Peoples sold 14.9 million in loans into the secondary market with servicing retained and 12.0 million in loans with servicing released, compared to 2.6 million and 11.8 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024, and 0.8 million and 9.4 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023.

 Sales-based incentive compensation increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter due to an increase of 0.4 million of Vantage-related incentive compensation. Sales-based incentive compensation for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 increased primarily due to additional employees added with the Limestone Merger. 
 The decrease in employee benefits for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter and the increase over the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to medical costs. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to higher medical costs reflecting a full nine months of expenses in 2024 for the additional employees added with the Limestone Merger. 
 Payroll taxes and other employment costs for the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the linked quarter due to a refund received in the second quarter of 2024 due to change in tax rate in the first quarter of 2024. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was driven by the additional employees added in the Limestone Merger coupled with annual merit increases. 
 Stock-based compensation is generally recognized over the vesting period, which generally ranges from immediate vesting to vesting at the end of three years. An adjustment is made at the vesting date to reverse expense relating to forfeitures for performance awards, and at the date of forfeiture to reverse expense for non-vested restricted common share awards. Stock grants to retirement eligible grantees are expensed either immediately or over a shorter period than three years. The majority of Peoples' stock-based compensation is attributable to annual equity-based incentive awards to employees, which are awarded in the first quarter of each year based upon Peoples achieving certain performance goals during the prior year, and are generally contingent on employment through the vesting period. Stock-based compensation for the first nine months of 2024 increased when compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to the additional employees added in the Limestone Merger. 
 Deferred personnel costs represent the portion of current period salaries and employee benefit costs considered to be direct loan origination costs. These costs are capitalized and recognized over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment in interest income. As a result, the amount of deferred personnel costs for each period corresponds directly with the volume of loan originations, coupled with the average deferred costs per loan that are updated annually at the beginning of each year. Deferred personnel costs for the third quarter of 2024 remained flat when compared to both the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023.

 Pre-Provision Net Revenue (Non-US GAAP) 
 Pre-provision net revenue ("PPNR") has become a key financial measure used by state and federal bank regulatory agencies when assessing the capital adequacy of financial institutions. PPNR is defined as net interest income plus total non-interest income, excluding all gains and losses, minus total non-interest expense. As a result, PPNR represents the earnings capacity that can be either retained in order to build capital or used to absorb unexpected losses and preserve existing capital. This measure represents a Non-US GAAP financial measure since it excludes the provision for (recovery of) credit losses and all gains and losses included in earnings. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of this Non-US GAAP financial measure to the amounts reported in Peoples' Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Pre-provision net revenue: Income before income taxes 40,881 35,876 40,729 114,609 101,597 Add: provision for credit losses 6,735 5,683 4,053 18,520 13,889 Add: loss on OREO 2 1 2 1,623 Add: loss on investment securities 74 353 7 428 2,108 Add: loss on other assets 764 397 283 1,470 557 Add: loss on other transactions 28 31 23 92 38 Pre-provision net revenue 48,484 42,340 45,096 135,121 119,812 
 The increase in the PPNR for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter was driven by increased non-interest income and higher accretion income. The increase in PPNR for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due to increased net interest income driven by higher rates. The increase in PPNR for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was driven by increased non-interest income and increased net interest income driven by higher rates. 
 
 Core Non-Interest Expense (Non-US GAAP) 
 Core non-interest expense is a financial measure used to evaluate Peoples' recurring expense stream. This measure is Non-US GAAP since it excludes the impact of all acquisition-related expenses, pension settlement charges, and the COVID-19 employee retention credit. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of this Non-US GAAP measure to the amounts reported in Peoples' Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented:

 Efficiency Ratio (Non-US GAAP) 
 The efficiency ratio is a key financial measure used to monitor performance. The efficiency ratio is calculated as total non-interest expense (less amortization of other intangible assets) as a percentage of FTE net interest income plus total non-interest income excluding net gains and losses. This measure is Non-US GAAP since it excludes amortization of other intangible assets and all gains and losses included in earnings, and uses FTE net interest income. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of this Non-US GAAP financial measure to the amounts reported in Peoples' Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented:

 (a) Interest income and yields are presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis, using a 21 statutory federal corporate income tax rate. 
 The efficiency ratio and the adjusted for non-core items efficiency ratio improved compared to the linked quarter improved mainly as the result of a reduction in non-interest expense and increase in net interest income. The efficiency ratio improved compared to the prior year first nine months due to the decrease in acquisition-related expenses. The efficiency ratio, adjusted for non-core items, was 57.7 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 54.2 for the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the efficiency ratio, adjusted for non-core items, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was due to higher non-interest expense. Peoples continues to focus on controlling expenses, while recognizing necessary costs in order to continue growing the business. 
 Return on Average Assets Adjusted for Non-Core Items Ratio (Non-US GAAP) 
 In addition to return on average assets, management uses return on average assets adjusted for non-core items to monitor performance. The return on average assets adjusted for non-core items ratio represents a Non-US GAAP financial measure since it excludes the after-tax impact of all gains and losses and acquisition-related expenses.

 1.39 1.30 1.69 1.34 1.59 
 (a) Based on a 21 statutory federal corporate income tax rate. 
 The return on average assets and the return on average assets adjusted for non-core items for the third quarter of 2024 increased when compared to the linked quarter, due to an increase in annualized net income resulting from higher non-interest income and a decrease in average assets. The decrease in the return on average assets adjusted for non-core items for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023, was attributable to the assets acquired in the Limestone Merger. The decrease in return on average assets adjusted for non-core items for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months of 2023, was primarily driven by the assets acquired in the Limestone Merger. 
 Return on Average Tangible Equity Ratio (Non-US GAAP) 
 The return on average tangible equity ratio is a key financial measure used to monitor performance. This ratio is calculated as annualized net income (less the after-tax impact of amortization of other intangible assets) divided by average tangible equity. This

 measure is Non-US GAAP since it excludes amortization of other intangible assets from earnings and the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired through acquisitions on total stockholders' equity.

 (a) Based on a 21 statutory federal corporate income tax rate. 
 The return on total average stockholders' equity and average tangible equity ratios increased when compared to the linked quarter due to an increase in annualized net income mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income. The decreases in the return on total average stockholders' equity and average tangible equity ratios for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 were driven by higher average stockholders' equity.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 At September 30, 2024, Peoples' interest-bearing deposits in other banks had decreased 170.6 million from December 31, 2023. The total cash and cash equivalents balance included 137.6 million of excess cash reserves being maintained at the FRB of Cleveland at September 30, 2024, compared to 309.8 million at December 31, 2023. The amount of excess cash reserves maintained is dependent upon Peoples' daily liquidity position, which is driven primarily by changes in deposit and loan balances. 
 Through the first nine months of 2024, Peoples' total cash and cash equivalents decreased 143.0 million, which reflected cash outflows of 126.6 million for investing activities and 119.6 million for financing activities, partially offset by cash inflows of 103.2 million from operating activities. Peoples' use of cash in investing activities reflected a 108.1 million net increase in loans held for investment and a net cash outflow from held-to-maturity investment securities of 9.9 million. The cash provided by financing activities was largely driven by a 445.0 million net increase in interest-bearing deposits, mostly offset by a net decrease in short-term borrowings of 425.2 million and a net decrease in non-interest bearing deposits of 114.2 million. 
 Further information regarding the management of Peoples' liquidity position can be found later in this discussion under Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity.

 (a) Amortized cost is presented net of the allowance for credit losses of 236 at September 30, 2024 and 238 at both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, total investment securities decreased compared to prior periods due to maturities and calls on securities during the quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Peoples executed the sales of 36.5 million of lower yielding available-for-sale investment securities for an after-tax loss of 1.3 million. Proceeds from the sales were used to purchase higher yielding agency investment securities. The realized losses recognized due to the fourth quarter of 2023 sales are expected to be earned back within 14 months of the transaction dates.

 (a) Includes all loans acquired, and related loan discount recorded as part of acquisition accounting, in 2012 or thereafter. Loans that were acquired and subsequently re-underwritten are reported as originated upon execution of such credit actions (for example, renewals and increases in lines of credit). 
 The period-end total loan and lease balances at September 30, 2024 decreased 53.5 million, or 3 annualized, compared to at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the period-end loan and lease balance at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by decreases of (i) 20.5 million in construction loans, (ii) 15.5 million in other commercial real estate loans (iii) 11.8 million of residential real estate loans, (iv) and 7.9 million in commercial and industrial loans. The increase in the period-end loan and lease balances at September 30, 2024 compared to at September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by loan growth for commercial and industrial and premium finance loans.

 Loan Concentration 
 Peoples categorizes its commercial loans according to standard industry classifications and monitors for concentrations in a single industry or multiple industries that could be impacted by changes in economic conditions in a similar manner. Peoples' commercial lending activities continue to be spread over a diverse range of businesses from all sectors of the economy, with no single industry comprising over 10 of Peoples' total loan portfolio. 
 Loans secured by commercial real estate, including commercial construction loans, continued to comprise the largest portion of Peoples' loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. The following tables provide information regarding the largest concentrations of commercial construction loans and other commercial real estate loans within the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024:

For all other states, the aggregate outstanding balances of commercial loans in each state were less than 3 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The repayment of premium finance loans is secured by the underlying insurance policy prepaid premium, and therefore, has no geographical impact from a repayment perspective. The repayment of leases is secured by the underlying equipment collateral and not real estate, which mitigates geographic risk.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The amount of the allowance for credit losses at the end of each period represents management's estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon its quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio. While this process involves allocations being made to specific loans and pools of loans, the entire allowance is available for all losses expected within the loan portfolio. 
 The following details management's allocation of the allowance for credit losses:

 The increase in the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases. The increase in the allowance balance at September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30, 2023 was driven by increase in reserves for individually analyzed loans and leases and loan growth. 
 Additional information regarding Peoples' allowance for credit losses can be found in "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Peoples' 2023 Form 10-K and "Note 4 Loans and Leases" of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.

 Compared to at June 30, 2024, Peoples' NPAs increased from 0.53 of total assets to 0.76 at September 30, 2024. Total loans 90+ days past due and accruing and nonaccrual loans in total increased at September 30, 2024 compared to at June 30, 2024 due primarily to increases in nonperforming leases. Total loans 90+ days past due increased from 7.6 million at June 30,2024 to 27.6 million at September 30, 2024, and were impacted by increases in leases, premium finance loans, and other commercial real estate loans. The increase in loans 90+ days past due is driven by higher administrative delinquencies on Vantage leases and premium finance loans. During the third quarter of 2024, criticized loans decreased 2.3 million, while classified loans increased 13.1 million when compared to at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the amounts of criticized loans compared to at June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by paydowns and upgrades of the risk rating. The increase in the amount of classified loans compared to at June 30, 2024 was primarily due to downgrades in the risk rating from newly reported loans. The increase in NPAs compared to at December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by increases of nonaccrual leases originated by our North Star Leasing division, commercial and industrial loans, and other commercial real estate loans. The increase in NPAs compared to at September 30, 2023, was impacted by the increase in nonaccrual leases originated by our North Star Leasing division and an increase in loans past due and accruing.

 (a) The sum of amounts presented is considered total demand deposits. 
 At September 30, 2024, period-end total deposits increased 185.4 million, or 3 , compared to at June 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases of (i) 83.3 million in brokered certificates of deposit, (ii) 71.3 million in retail certificates of deposit, and (iii) 57.8 million in governmental deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease of 19.3 million in non-interest bearing deposits. The increase in retail certificates of deposits was due to current specials being offered, while the increase in governmental deposit accounts was due to the seasonality of those balances. The increase in brokered deposits was due to the lower-cost of funding available compared to Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances. 
 At September 30, 2024, period-end total deposits increased 445.6 million, or 6 , compared to at September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 685.4 million in retail certificates of deposit, 163.8 million in money market deposit accounts, and 62.5 million in governmental deposit accounts, offset by decreases of 122.2 million, 115.7 million, 115.2 million, and 113.0 million in savings accounts, non-interest bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and brokered certificates of deposit, respectively. The increase in retail certificates of deposits was driven by current promotions being offered. Given the rate environment, there has been a mix shift in the deposit portfolio over the last twelve months. 
 As part of its funding strategy, Peoples hedges 90-day brokered CDs with interest rate swaps. The interest rate swaps pay a fixed rate of interest while receiving a floating rate component of interest tied to term SOFR, which offsets the rate on the brokered CDs. As of September 30, 2024, Peoples had 9 effective interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional value of 85.0 million, which were designated as cash flow hedges. Peoples continually evaluates the overall balance sheet position given the interest rate environment.

 Total borrowed funds, which include overnight borrowings, are mainly a function of loan growth and changes in total deposit balances. Other long-term borrowings include trust preferred securities held for investments and floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. Total borrowed funds at September 30, 2024 decreased compared to at June 30, 2024 and at September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower FHLB overnight borrowings. 
 
 Capital/Stockholders Equity 
 At September 30, 2024, capital levels for both Peoples and Peoples Bank remained substantially higher than the minimum amounts needed to be considered "well capitalized" institutions under applicable banking regulations. These higher capital levels reflect Peoples' desire to maintain a strong capital position. In order to avoid limitations on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation, Peoples must exceed the three minimum required ratios by at least the capital conservation buffer of 2.50 , which applies to the common equity tier 1 ("CET1") ratio, the tier 1 capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio. At September 30, 2024, Peoples had a capital conservation buffer of 5.49 . 
 The following table details Peoples' risk-based capital levels and corresponding ratios: 
 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Capital Amounts: Common Equity Tier 1 821,192 799,710 780,017 766,691 752,728 Tier 1 875,800 854,050 834,089 820,495 801,010 Total (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 938,474 916,073 894,662 873,225 855,054 Net risk-weighted assets 6,958,225 6,814,149 6,674,114 6,524,577 6,505,779 Capital Ratios: Common Equity Tier 1 11.80 11.74 11.69 11.75 11.57 Tier 1 12.59 12.53 12.50 12.58 12.31 Total (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 13.49 13.44 13.40 13.38 13.14 Tier 1 leverage ratio 9.86 9.56 9.43 9.57 9.34 
 Peoples' risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2024 increased when compared to June 30, 2024, due to net income during the quarter, partially offset by dividends paid. Compared to at September 30, 2023, the tier 1 risk-based capital and the total risk-based capital ratios improved due to higher net income, partially offset by dividends paid. The common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at September 30, 2024 also increased compared to at September 30, 2023 due to higher net income. 
 In addition to traditional capital measurements, management uses tangible capital measures to evaluate the adequacy of Peoples' stockholders' equity. Such ratios represent Non-US GAAP financial measures since their calculation removes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired through acquisitions on amounts reported in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes this information is useful to investors since it facilitates the comparison of Peoples' operating performance, financial condition and trends to peers, especially those without a similar level of intangible assets to that of Peoples. Further, intangible assets generally are difficult to convert into cash, especially during a financial crisis, and could decrease substantially in

 value should there be deterioration in the overall franchise value. As a result, tangible equity represents a conservative measure of the capacity for Peoples to incur losses but remain solvent. 
 The following table reconciles the calculation of these Non-US GAAP financial measures to amounts reported in Peoples' Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:

 Tangible book value per common share increased to 20.29 at September 30, 2024 compared to 18.91 at June 30, 2024. The change in tangible book value per common share was due to tangible equity increasing during the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to net income and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the last three months. Tangible book value per common share at September 30, 2024 increased compared to at September 30, 2023 primarily due to net income over the last twelve months. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity 
 While Peoples is exposed to various business risks, the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are major risks that can materially impact future results of operations and financial condition due to their complexity and dynamic nature. The objective of Peoples' asset-liability management function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity and safety. This objective requires Peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through its management of the mix of assets and liabilities, their related cash flows and the rates earned and paid on those assets and liabilities. Ultimately, the asset-liability management function is intended to guide management in the acquisition and disposition of earning assets and selection of appropriate funding sources. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk ("IRR") is one of the most significant risks arising in the normal course of business of financial services companies like Peoples. IRR is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact the earnings stream, as well as market values, of financial assets and financial liabilities. Peoples' exposure to IRR is due primarily to differences in the maturity or repricing of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, other factors, such as prepayments of loans and investment securities, or early withdrawal of deposits, can affect Peoples' exposure to IRR and impact interest costs or revenue streams. 
 Peoples has assigned overall management of IRR to its Asset-Liability Committee (the ALCO ), which has established an IRR management policy that sets minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level of IRR, including the review of assumptions used in modeling IRR.

 Increase (Decrease) in Interest Rate Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Estimated (Decrease) Increase in Economic Value of Equity (in Basis Points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 300 24,025 7.2 15,063 4.6 (53,947) (3.2) (157,625) (9.4) 200 16,598 5.0 10,282 3.1 (32,181) (1.9) (107,620) (6.4) 100 8,502 2.5 5,468 1.7 (14,874) (0.9) (53,585) (3.2) (100) (9,491) (2.8) (7,427) (2.3) (6,260) (0.4) 31,722 1.9 (200) (16,509) (4.9) (15,446) (4.7) (37,417) (2.2) 46,537 2.8 (300) (12,492) (3.7) (16,822) (5.1) (98,666) (5.9) 47,198 2.8 
 This table uses a standard, parallel shock analysis for assessing the IRR to net interest income and the economic value of equity. A parallel shock assumes all points on the yield curve (one year, two year, three year, etc.) are directionally changed by the same degree. Management regularly assesses the impact of both increasing and decreasing interest rates. The table above shows the impact of upward and downward parallel shocks of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. 
 Estimated changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity are partially driven by assumptions regarding the rate at which non-maturity deposits will reprice given a move in short-term interest rates, as well as assumptions regarding prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities. These and other modeling assumptions are monitored closely by Peoples on an ongoing basis. 
 While parallel interest rate shock scenarios are useful in assessing the level of IRR inherent in the balance sheet, interest rates typically move in a nonparallel manner with differences in the timing, direction and magnitude of changes in short-term and long-term interest rates. Thus, any impact that might occur as a result of the Federal Reserve Board increasing short-term interest rates in the future could be offset by an inverse movement in long-term interest rates, and vice versa. For this reason, Peoples considers other interest rate scenarios in addition to analyzing the impact of parallel yield curve shifts. These include various flattening and steepening scenarios in which short-term and long-term interest rates move in different directions with varying magnitude. Peoples believes these scenarios to be more reflective of how interest rates change versus the severe parallel rate shocks described above. Given the shape of market yield curves at September 30, 2024, consideration of the bear steepener and bull steepener scenarios provide insights which were not captured by parallel shifts. 
 The bear steepener scenario highlights the risk to net interest income and economic value of equity when short-term interest rates remain constant while long-term interest rates rise. In such a scenario, Peoples' deposit and borrowing costs, which are generally correlated with short-term interest rates, remain constant, while asset yields, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, rise. At September 30, 2024, the bear steepener scenario produced an increase in net interest income of 0.8 and an increase in the economic value of equity of 5.6 . 
 The bull steepener scenario highlights the risk to net interest income and the economic value of equity when short-term rates fall faster than long-term rates. In such a scenario, Peoples' deposit and short-term borrowing costs, which are correlated with short-term rates, decrease, while long-term asset yields and long-term borrowing costs, which are more correlated with long-term rates, remain constant. Decreased deposit and funding costs would be more than offset by increased variable rate asset yields over a longer horizon; resulting in an increased amount of net interest income and net interest margin over a 24-month period. At September 30, 2024, the bull steepener scenario produced a decline of 0.4 to net interest income, as the impact of recent term funding mitigates the impact of lower short-term rates over a 12-month horizon, and an increase in the economic value of equity of 2.8 . Over a 24-month horizon, the bull steepener scenario produced an increase of 1.0 to net interest income. 
 Peoples has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Peoples making fixed payments. As of September 30, 2024, Peoples had entered into 9 interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of 85.0 million. Additional information regarding Peoples interest rate swaps can be found in Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 At September 30, 2024, Peoples' Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet was positioned to benefit from rising interest rates, while also mitigating the impact to net interest income decreasing rate scenarios. The table above illustrates this point as changes to net interest income increase in the rising interest rate scenarios. 
 Liquidity 
 In addition to IRR management, another major objective of the ALCO is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity. In light of the bank failures in 2023, Peoples revisited the model assumptions, and determined the methods used by the ALCO to monitor

 and evaluate the adequacy of Peoples Bank's liquidity position remain appropriate and are largely unchanged from those disclosed in Peoples' 2023 Form 10-K. 
 At September 30, 2024, Peoples Bank had liquid assets of 444.5 million, which represented 4.3 of total assets and unfunded loan commitments. Peoples also had an additional 167.0 million of unpledged investment securities not included in the measurement of liquid assets. 
 Management believes the current mix of short-term liquidity sources, loan and security portfolio cash flows, and availability of other funding sources will allow Peoples to meet anticipated cash obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Activities and Contractual Obligations 
 In the normal course of business, Peoples is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk necessary to meet the financing needs of Peoples' customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract amounts of these instruments express the extent of involvement Peoples has in these financial instruments. 
 Loan Commitments and Standby Letters of Credit 
 Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of Peoples' customers. Standby letters of credit are instruments issued by Peoples Bank guaranteeing the beneficiary payment by Peoples Bank in the event of default by Peoples Bank's customer in the performance of an obligation or service. Historically, most loan commitments and standby letters of credit expire unused. Peoples Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter-party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Peoples Bank uses the same underwriting standards in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 
 Peoples Bank routinely engages in activities that involve, to varying degrees, elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These activities are part of Peoples Bank's normal course of business and include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments, interest rate contracts and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low-income housing tax credit investments. Traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments continue to represent the most significant off-balance sheet exposure. 
 The following table details the total contractual amount of loan commitments and standby letters of credit:

 (c) Peoples disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in Peoples' internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during Peoples' fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Peoples internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Peoples or one of its subsidiaries from time to time is engaged in various litigation matters including the defense of claims of improper loan or deposit practices or lending violations. In addition, in the ordinary course of their respective businesses or operations, Peoples or one of its subsidiaries may be named as a plaintiff, a defendant, or a party to a legal proceeding or any of their respective properties may be subject to various pending and threatened legal proceedings and various actual and potential claims. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, Peoples cannot state what the eventual outcome of any such matters will be; however, based on management's current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, Peoples' management believes that damages, if any, and other amounts related to pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of Peoples. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes from those risk factors previously disclosed under ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of Part I of Peoples 2023 Form 10-K. These risk factors are not the only risks Peoples faces.
