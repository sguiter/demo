 Total Total non-accrual loans 
 The determination of non-accrual or accrual status of PCD loans is made at the pool level, not the individual loan level. 
 For December 31, 2023, total commercial non-accrual loans exclude million of non-accrual commercial loans held-for-sale, these loans were sold during the second quarter of 2024. There were commercial non-accrual loans held-for-sale at September 30, 2024. 
 Delinquent residential mortgage loans insured or guaranteed under applicable Federal Housing Administration FHA and Veterans Administration VA programs are classified as non-performing loans when they become days or more past due but are not placed in non-accrual status until they become months or more past due, since they are insured loans. Therefore, those loans are included as non-performing loans but excluded from non-accrual loans.

PCD loans, except for single-pooled loans, are not included in the table above as their unit of account is the loan pool. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators 
 OFG categorizes its loans into loan grades based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debts, such as economic conditions, portfolio risk characteristics, prior loss experience, and the results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans. 
 OFG uses the following definitions for loan grades: 
 Pass: Loans classified as pass have a well-defined primary source of repayment very likely to be sufficient, with no apparent risk, strong financial position, minimal operating risk, profitability, liquidity and capitalization better than industry standards. 
 Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, questionable and improbable. 
 Loss: Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this worthless loan even though partial recovery may be effected in the future. 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the process described above are considered to be pass loans.

 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10 variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption. 
 Changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which may magnify or offset the sensitivities. Mortgage banking activities, a component of total banking and financial service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations, include the changes from period to period in the fair value of the mortgage loan servicing rights, which may result from changes in the valuation model inputs or assumptions (principally reflecting changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions) and other changes, including changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows. 
 Servicing fee income is based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and is recorded as income when earned and included in the mortgage banking activities section in the consolidated statement of operations.

The decrease in valuation allowance of thousand was mainly related to OFG s operations at the holding company level. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax asset, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the assessment of positive and negative evidence, the level of historical taxable income, projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset are deductible, and provisions of certain closing agreements, management believes it is more likely than not that OFG will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, at September 30, 2024. The amount of the deferred tax asset that is considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if there are changes in estimates of future taxable income.

Pursuant to such termination, the third-party servicer assumed the direct servicing of the subserviced loans pursuant to FNMA s residential mortgage loans sales program, thereby relieving OFG of its corresponding recourse obligation under that program. 
 Net recoveries (charge-offs/terminations) ) ) Balance at end of period 
 The expected loss, which represents the amount expected to be lost on a given loan, considers the probability of default and loss severity. The probability of default represents the probability that a loan in good standing would become 120 days delinquent, in which case OFG is obligated to repurchase the loan. 
 If a borrower defaults, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, OFG is required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that OFG would be required to make under the recourse arrangements is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, OFG repurchased thousand and thousand, respectively, in mortgage loans. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, OFG repurchased thousand and thousand, respectively, in such mortgage loans. If a borrower defaults, OFG has rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. OFG suffers losses on these mortgage loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the collateral property are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan, any uncollected interest advanced, and the costs of holding and disposing the related property. 
 When OFG sells or securitizes mortgage loans, it generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold. OFG s mortgage operations division groups conforming mortgage loans into pools that are exchanged for FNMA and GNMA mortgage-backed securities, which are generally sold to private investors, or are sold directly to FNMA or other private investors for cash. As required under such mortgage-backed securities programs, quality review procedures are performed by OFG to ensure that asset guideline qualifications are met. To the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics, OFG may be required to repurchase such loans or indemnify for losses and bear any subsequent loss related to the loans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, OFG repurchased million (September 30, 2023 million) of unpaid principal balance in mortgage loans, excluding mortgage loans subject to such credit recourse provision. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, OFG repurchased million (September 30, 2023- million). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFG had a thousand and a thousand liability, respectively, for the estimated credit losses related to these loans.

 thousand and thousand in gains, net of reserves, respectively, from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans sold subject to credit recourse, and thousand in losses and thousand in gains, respectively, from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans as a result of breaches of customary representations and warranties. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,OFG recognized thousand and thousand, respectively, in gains from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans sold subject to credit recourse, and thousand in losses and thousand in gains, respectively, from the repurchase of residential mortgage loans as a result of breaches of customary representations and warranties. 
 At September 30, 2024, OFG serviced billion (December 31, 2023 - billion) in mortgage loans for third parties, including subserviced mortgage loans. Servicing agreements relating to the mortgage-backed securities programs of FNMA and GNMA, and to mortgage loans sold or serviced to certain other investors, including FHLMC, require OFG to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, taxes and insurance, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. OFG generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements from the mortgage owner, from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed or, in the case of FHA/VA loans, under the applicable FHA and VA insurance and guarantee programs. However, in the meantime, OFG must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding. OFG must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans. In addition, if a defaulted loan is not cured, the mortgage loan would be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and OFG would not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of funds advanced by OFG under such mortgage loan servicing agreements was approximately million (December 31, 2023 - million). To the extent the mortgage loans underlying OFG s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies, OFG would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts. 
 
 NOTE 18 
 Commercial letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit represent agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. OFG evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by OFG upon the extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commitments to extend credit consisted mainly of undisbursed available amounts on commercial lines of credit, construction loans, and revolving credit card arrangements. Since many of the unused commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used, the total amount of these unused commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

 Loans sold with recourse 
 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are written conditional commitments issued by OFG to guarantee the payment and/or performance of a customer to a third party beneficiary ). If the customer fails to comply with the agreement, the beneficiary may draw on the standby letter of credit or financial guarantee as a remedy. The amount of credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit in the event of non-performance is the face amount of the letter of credit or financial guarantee. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by OFG upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures corresponding to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit amounted to thousand and million, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the statement of financial condition. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFG maintained other non-credit commitments amounting to million and million, respectively, primarily for the acquisition of equity securities. In addition, as we continue to transform OFG with a focus on simplification and building a culture of excellence and customer service, we continue to invest in technology that drive our strategy, namely digital, data analytics, cloud migration, cyber security, and our sales and service capabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFG had commitments for capital expenditures in technology amounting to million and million, respectively. 
 Contingencies 
 OFG and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings incidental to their business. In the ordinary course of business, OFG and its subsidiaries are also subject to governmental and regulatory examinations. Certain subsidiaries of OFG, including the Bank (and its subsidiary, OIB), Oriental Financial Services and Oriental Insurance, are subject to regulation by various U.S., Puerto Rico and other regulators. 
 OFG seeks to resolve all arbitration, litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of OFG and its shareholders, and contests allegations of liability or wrongdoing and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter. 
 In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, OFG establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, OFG, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, OFG will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of expense. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued liability for legal contingencies amounted to thousand and thousand, respectively. OFG continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. OFG also has an accrued liability for potential losses, operational errors, loss on theft not covered by insurance premiums, uncollectible receivables, among other transactions, amounting to thousand and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Servicing assets 
 Servicing assets do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Servicing assets are priced using a discounted cash flow model. The valuation model considers servicing fees, portfolio characteristics, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenues, cost to service, and other economic factors. Due to the unobservable nature of certain valuation inputs, the servicing rights are classified as Level 3. 
 Foreclosed real estate 
 Foreclosed real estate includes real estate properties securing residential mortgage and commercial loans. The fair value of foreclosed real estate may be determined using an external appraisal, broker price opinion or an internal valuation. These foreclosed assets are classified as Level 3 given certain internal adjustments that may be made to external appraisals.

Information about Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs 
 Servicing assets The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of OFG s servicing assets are constant prepayment rates and discount rates. Changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which may magnify or offset the sensitivities. Mortgage banking activities, a component of total banking and financial service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations, include the changes from period to period in the fair value of the mortgage loan servicing rights, which may result from changes in the valuation model inputs or assumptions (principally reflecting changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions) and other changes, including changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The information about the estimated fair value of financial instruments required by GAAP is presented hereunder. The aggregate fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent management s estimate of the underlying value of OFG. 
 The estimated fair value is subjective in nature, involves uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could affect these fair value estimates. The fair value estimates do not take into consideration the value of future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments. Other significant tangible and intangible assets that are not considered financial instruments include the value of long-term customer relationships of retail deposits, and premises and equipment.

 OFG recognizes the revenue from banking services, wealth management and mortgage banking based on the nature and timing of revenue streams from contracts with customers: 
 Banking Service Revenues 
 Electronic banking fees are credit and debit card processing services, fees for using the Bank s ATMs by non-customers, debit card interchange income, and service charges on deposit accounts. Revenue is recorded once the contracted service has been provided. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Durbin Amendment became applicable to the Bank as a result of crossing the billion asset threshold in December 31, 2023, which imposes limits on what banks may charge for debit card interchange fees. 
 Service charges on checking and saving accounts is recognized as consumer periodic maintenance revenue once the service is rendered, while overdraft and late charges revenues are recorded after the contracted service has been provided. 
 Other income as credit life and branch service commissions, servicing and other loan fees, international fees, and miscellaneous income recognized as banking services revenue are out of the scope of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. The decrease in interest income and interest expense from the prior year period was mainly as a result of lower interest rate and average balance.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 OFG is a publicly-owned financial holding company that provides wide range of banking and financial services such as commercial, consumer, auto, and mortgage lending, financial planning, insurance sales, investment advisory and securities brokerage services, as well as corporate and individual trust services. It operates through three business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury, and distinguishes itself based on quality service. OFG conducts its business through its main office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, forty-two branches in Puerto Rico and two branches in the U.S. Virgin Islands (the USVI ). It has five subsidiaries with operations in Puerto Rico: the Bank, Oriental Financial Services, Oriental Insurance, OIB and OBPEF; two subsidiaries in the United States, OFG USA and OFG Ventures; and one subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, OFG Reinsurance. OFG s long-term goal is to strengthen its banking and financial services franchise by expanding its lending businesses, increasing the level of integration in the marketing and delivery of banking and financial services, continuously improving our already effective asset-liability management, growing non-interest revenue from banking and financial services, as well as achieving greater operating efficiencies. 
 
 OFG s diversified mix of businesses and products generates both the interest income traditionally associated with a banking institution and non-interest income traditionally associated with a financial services institution (generated by such businesses as securities brokerage, fiduciary services, investment advisory, insurance agency and reinsurance). Although all of these businesses, to varying degrees, are affected by interest rate and financial market fluctuations and other external factors, OFG s commitment is to continue producing a balanced and growing revenue stream. 
 
 OFG s mission is to make possible the progress of our customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve. OFG has been deploying its Digital First strategy to achieve this mission. Our strategy highly differentiates OFG through a sales and service business model and culture that emphasizes convenience and accessibility through digital channels while creating a simple, self-service and enjoyable customer experience. OFG strives to proactively identify customer objectives and needs to offer value-added services that help them achieve financial progress and well-being. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 Capital Actions 
 In October 2024, OFG announced that its Board of Directors approved a new 50.0 million stock repurchase program, in addition to the stock repurchase program approved in January 2024. The October stock repurchase program is open-ended. In January 2024, the Board of Directors approved the increase of its regular quarterly cash dividend to 0.25 per common share from 0.22 per share, beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and a 50.0 million stock repurchase program. The January stock repurchase program, which is open-ended, replaced the prior stock repurchase approved by the Board of Directors in January 2022, which had 17.2 million remaining of its 100.0 million repurchase parameters. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, OFG repurchased 671,800 shares for a total of 24.4 million at an average price of 36.30 per share.

Economic Conditions 
 We believe that Puerto Rico s economy continues to demonstrate resiliency and growth and its private sector, including business investments, is expanding. The Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index, as published by the Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico, registered 126.9 points in August 2024, which represents a decrease of 0.8 when compared to the same period of the previous year. However, according to the data published by the Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico, wages are rising, and labor participation is increasing. Total non-farm payroll employment averaged 963,900 jobs in August 2024, equivalent to an increase of 0.2 on a month-over-month basis, and an annual increase of 1.9 . The inflow of federal stimulus and reconstruction funds for rebuilding infrastructure has continued, and we believe this inflow will stimulate the local economy. Nevertheless, OFG continues to pay attention to the potential impact of interest rate changes, inflation, other economic factors, and global conflicts, all of which could impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our 2023 Form 10-K, we identified the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment as a critical accounting policy and estimate because it involves significant estimation uncertainty that has or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. As part of OFG s continuous enhancement to the allowance for credit losses methodology, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an assessment of the weight of probability scenarios for the US loan segment was performed and updated to use a higher probability level in the moderate recessionary scenario. This change in the allowance for credit losses is considered a change in accounting estimate as per ASC 250-10 provisions, where adjustments should be made prospectively. Apart from the foregoing change, there have been no material changes in the methods that we used to formulate these critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 We believe that the third quarter was another solid quarter of performance for OFG, with EPS-diluted up 5.3 year-over-year on a 1.1 increase in total core revenues. OFG continued to produce consistent, core operating results, and digital adoption of our new and upgraded products, services, and self-service tools keeps steadily growing. We celebrate our 60th anniversary by renewing our commitment to bring progress to our customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve. 
 Earnings per share diluted of 1.00 compared to 1.08 in the second quarter of 2024 and 0.95 in the third quarter of 2023. Total core revenues of 174.1 million compared to 179.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 172.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.

 Total Interest Income of 189.0 million compared to 187.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 165.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the third quarter of 2024 increased 1.4 million, primarily reflecting higher principal balances and yields of investment securities, higher balances of loans, and the absence of a 2.1 million loan recovery on a non-accrual U.S. commercial loan paid in full during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Total Interest Expense of 41.2 million compared to 40.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 23.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.8 million, reflecting higher average balances of higher-cost borrowings and brokered deposits and slightly reduced average core deposit balances and cost. 
 65 

Total Banking and Financial Service Revenues of 26.3 million compared to 32.1 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 30.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected 2.7 million in reduced interchange fees due to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment during the third quarter of 2024, 2.1 million reduced mortgage servicing rights valuation due to lower long-term rates, and 0.3 million revenue from the acquisition in late August 2024 of a 1.7 billion Puerto Rico residential mortgage servicing portfolio. 
 Pre-Provision Net Revenues of 83.1 million compared to 86.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 82.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Total Provision for Credit Losses of 21.4 million compared to 15.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 16.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected 18.7 million for increased loan volume; 5.2 million related to the annual update of auto risk drivers and consumer loan loss factors, and the extension of cash flows in a PR commercial loan up for renewal; and a 2.7 million reserve release mainly due to an improved U.S. macroeconomic perspective. 
 Credit Quality: Net charge-offs of 17.1 million (0.90 of average loans) compared to 15.0 million (0.79 in the second quarter of 2024 and 18.8 million (1.05 in the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024 early and total delinquency rates were 2.78 and 4.10 , respectively. The nonperforming loan rate was 1.11 . The third quarter of 2024 total delinquency rate increased sequentially due to booking of the GNMA buy-back option program related to the previously mentioned mortgage servicing portfolio acquisition. 
 Total Non-Interest Expense of 91.6 million compared to 93.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 90.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 included a 2.3 million credit and debit card processing business contract renewal rebate and 1.3 million in expenses related to sales of repossessed assets. 
 Effective Tax Rate ETR of 23.9 compared to 28.2 in the second quarter of 2024 and 31.9 in the third quarter of 2023. Lower third quarter of 2024 ETR reflected an estimated 2024 ETR of 26.8 due to higher forecasted business activities with preferential tax treatment under the Puerto Rico tax code, coupled with discrete benefits of 3.1 million mainly related to stock vested in the first quarter of 2024 and tax credit purchases. 
 Loans Held for Investment of 7.75 billion compared to 7.64 billion in the second quarter of 2024 and 7.26 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the third quarter of 2024 increased 1.5 , reflecting growth in Puerto Rico and U.S. commercial loans and Puerto Rico auto and consumer loans, and regular paydowns and securitization of residential mortgages. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the third quarter of 2024 increased 6.7 . 
 New Loan Production of 572.2 million compared to 589.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 and 567.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, the third quarter of 2024 production reflected increases in U.S. commercial and Puerto Rico consumer lending originations, and decreases in Puerto Rico commercial and auto lending originations.

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is a function of the difference between rates earned on OFG s interest-earning assets and rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities (interest rate spread) and the relative amounts of its interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (interest rate margin). OFG constantly monitors the composition and re-pricing of its assets and liabilities to maintain its net interest income at adequate levels. 
 Comparison of quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net interest income of 147.9 million increased 6.1 million from 141.8 million. Tax equivalent basis net interest income of 153.2 million increased 7.9 million, or 5.5 , from 145.2 million. 
 Interest rate spread decreased 43 basis points to 5.28 from 5.71 and net interest margin decreased 37 basis points to 5.43 from 5.80 . 
 Net interest income was positively impacted by: 
 A 12.3 million increase in interest income from loans, primarily driven by: (i) higher interest income of 7.0 million from auto loans, mainly due to an increase in the average balance of this portfolio by 281.6 million from new loans originated; (ii) higher interest income of 5.1 million from commercial loans, reflecting the upward repricing of variable rate loans and increased yields on new loans originated during 2024; and (iii) higher interest income of 1.6 million from consumer loans, mainly due to an increase in the average balance of this portfolio by 50.9 million. These increases were partially offset by lower interest income of 1.4 million from residential mortgage loans, reflecting a decrease in the average balance of this portfolio by 129.8 million, mainly from regular paydowns and the securitization and sale of conforming loans; and 
 A 11.7 million increase in interest income from investments securities, primarily due to the acquisition of higher-yield investment securities during 2024 and late 2023. It reflects higher yield by 90 basis points, which contributed to an increase in interest income of approximately 5.3 million and higher average volume of 742.0 million, resulting in an increase in interest income of approximately 6.4 million. 
 These increases were offset by higher interest expense of 17.2 million, 17.5 million from deposits due to higher average cost of 63 basis points, reflecting a 1.2 billion deposit from an existing long-standing Puerto Rico government client received in December 2023 with a variable interest rate. 
 73 

Comparison of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net interest income of 439.3 million increased by 22.0 million from 417.3 million. Tax equivalent basis net interest income of 452.3 million increased 23.0 million, or 5.4 , from 429.3 million. 
 Interest rate spread decreased by 48 basis points to 5.30 from 5.78 and net interest margin decreased 41 basis points to 5.44 from 5.85 . This reflects a an increase of 32 and 80 basis points, respectively, in the total average yield of interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Net interest income was positively impacted by: 
 A 52.3 million increase in interest income from loans driven by higher interest income from: (i) commercial loans of 28.4 million, primarily related to the upward repricing of variable rate commercial loans, increased yields on new loans originated during 2024, and higher average balance; (ii) auto loans of 23.3 million reflecting higher originations during 2024; and (iii) consumer loans of 5.8 million mainly due to an increase of 60.1 million in the average balance of this portfolio. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 5.2 million in interest income from mortgage loans due to a reduction of 136.2 million in the average balance of this portfolio, mainly from regular paydowns and the securitization and sale of conforming loans; and 
 A 34.5 million increase in interest income from investment securities, primarily due to the acquisition of higher-yield investment securities during 2024 and late 2023. Purchases contributed to higher average volume of 698.0 million, which resulted in an increase in interest income of 17.5 million, and higher yield by 98 basis points, which contributed to the increase in net interest income of 17.1 million. 
 These increases were partially offset by higher interest expense of 65.5 million from interest paid on: (i) deposits of 63.7 million due to higher average cost of total deposits of 80 basis points, reflecting a 1.2 billion deposit from an existing long-standing Puerto Rico government client received in December 2023 with a variable interest rate, and (ii) borrowings of 1.7 million reflecting FHLB advances taken in late 2023 and in the third quarter of 2024.

 Non-Interest Income 
 Non-interest income is affected by fees generated from loans and deposit accounts, the amount of assets under management of the Bank s trust department, transactions generated by clients financial assets serviced by OFG s securities broker-dealer, insurance agency and reinsurance subsidiaries, the level of mortgage banking activities, and gains or losses on sales of assets. 

74 

Comparison of quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 OFG recorded non-interest income, net, in the amount of 26.9 million, compared to 30.7 million, a decrease of 12.5 , or 3.8 million. The decrease in non-interest income was mainly due to the net effect of: 
 A 3.1 million decrease in mortgage banking activities mainly from: (i) 2.1 million unfavorable impact in mortgage servicing rights valuation due to lower long-term rates and (ii) lower gains of 390 thousand on repurchased loan sales in the current quarter, offset by higher servicing fees of 467 thousand, mainly from the acquisition in late August 2024 of a 1.7 billion Puerto Rico residential mortgage servicing portfolio; and 
 A 1.7 million decrease in banking service revenues related to: (i) 2.7 million in reduced interchange fees mainly due to the implementation of Durbin Amendment that took effect during the current quarter, offset by higher merchant income of 417 thousand resulting from higher transactionality and migration of USVI merchant activity. 
 These decreases were offset by a 758 thousand increase in wealth management revenue primarily reflecting: (i) 304 thousand increase in broker-dealer fees related to higher market asset values and investment advisory service fees and (ii) 372 thousand increase in insurance income related to annuities and reinsurance income of 235 thousand and 121 thousand, respectively.

 A 1.1 million loss associated with the sale of a 149.4 million short-term US treasury note available for sale during the prior period. 
 These increases were offset by: 
 A 2.7 million decrease in mortgage banking activities mainly from: (i) unfavorable impact in mortgage servicing rights valuation due to lower long-term rates of 1.9 million, (ii) lower gains on repurchased loan sales in the current quarter of 321 thousand and (iii) lower servicing fees of 121 thousand due to less cash collections. 
 A 662 thousand decrease in banking service revenues mainly due to lower fees on deposits of 656 thousand from lower maintenance and overdrawn fees and higher waived fees.

 Comparison of quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Non-interest expense was 91.6 million, representing an increase of 1.6 or 1.4 million, compared to 90.2 million. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly due to: 
 Increase of 1.3 million in foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets expenses, net of income, due to unfavorable valuation adjustments and lower gain on sale of foreclosed real estate due to lower volume of properties sold; 
 Increase of 388 thousand in insurance expenses related to higher FDIC deposit insurance assessment expense as a result of the Bank exceeding 10 billion in assets; 
 Increase of 373 thousand in compensation and employee benefits, as a result of higher salaries and benefits, including payroll taxes; and 
 Increase of 335 thousand in taxes, other than payroll and income taxes related to higher municipal taxes recorded during the quarter. 
 
 76 

These increases were partially offset by: 
 D ecrease of 1.4 million in electronic banking charges mainly due to the recognition of a 2.3 million rebate received during the quarter, offset by increases of 964 thousand in point-of-sale and merchant-related fees due to increased transaction volumes. 
 The efficiency ratio was 52.60 compared to 52.36 . The efficiency ratio measures how much of OFG s revenues is used to pay operating expenses. OFG computes its efficiency ratio by dividing non-interest expenses by the sum of its net interest income and non-interest income, but excluding gains on the sale of investment securities, other gains and losses, and other income that may be considered volatile in nature. Management believes that the exclusion of those items permits consistent comparability. Amounts presented as part of non-interest income that were excluded from the adjusted efficiency ratio computation for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 597 thousand and 295 thousand, respectively. 
 
 Comparison of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Non-interest expense was 276.0 million, representing an increase of 2.5 , or 6.7 million, compared to 269.3 million. The increase in non-interest expense was mainly due to:

 Increase in compensation and employee benefits of 2.3 million due to higher salaries and benefits, including payroll taxes; 
 Increase in advertising, business promotion, and strategic initiatives of 989 thousand due to higher expenses related to digital adoption strategy; 
 Increase of 628 thousand in other expenses, primarily driven by a 993 thousand accrual recorded during the current period related to regulatory examinations, partially offset by lower charitable contributions of 532 thousand ; and 
 Increase of 576 thousand in insurance expenses related to higher FDIC deposit insurance assessment expense as a result of the Bank exceeding 10 billion in assets. 
 The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by, a decrease in professional and service fees of 1.1 million, reflecting lower balances in compliance-related expenses. 
 The efficiency ratio was 52.30 , an improvement from 53.10 . Amounts presented as part of non-interest income that were excluded from the efficiency ratio computation for nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 1.3 million and 121 thousand, respective ly.

The provision for credit losses for 2023 reflected a provision of 23.8 million related to the growth in loan balances, a provision of 14.7 million related to commercial specific loan reserves, mainly in the US commercial loan portfolio, and 5.1 million 
 77

 Business Segments 
 OFG segregates its businesses into the following segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury. Management established the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. Other factors such as OFG s organization, nature of its products, distribution channels and economic characteristics of its services were also considered in the determination of the reportable segments. OFG measures the performance of these reportable segments based on pre-established goals of different financial parameters such as net income, net interest income, loan production, and fees generated. OFG s methodology for allocating non-interest expenses among segments is based on several factors such as revenue, employee headcount, occupied space, dedicated services or time, among others. Following are the results of operations and the selected financial information by operating segment for the quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 81 

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Assets Owned 
 At September 30, 2024, OFG s total assets amounted to 11.461 billion, a increase of 116.9 million, when compared to 11.344 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash and due from banks decreased by 68.8 million to 674.7 million, reflecting the effect of loan funding and lower deposit balances. 
 The investment portfolio decreased by 78.2 million or 2.9 primarily driven by the maturity of 901.7 million in US Treasury securities, principal paydowns of 208.1 million, mainly on mortgage-backed securities, and the sale of 149.4 million of US Treasury securities available-for-sale. These decreases were offset by 1.070 billion new available-for-sale US Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, and 55.7 million in mortgage loan securitization. OFG s investment strategy focuses on liquidity and highly liquid securities, considering their investment and the current market environment. 
 OFG s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by real estate, other commercial and industrial loans, commercial US loans, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and auto loans. At September 30, 2024, OFG s net loan portfolio increased by 203.1 million or 2.7 reflecting increases in commercial, retail auto and consumer loans, partially offset by regular paydowns and securitization of residential mortgage loans. 
 
 Financial Assets Managed 
 At September 30, 2024, OFG s financial assets include those managed by OFG s trust division and its securities broker-dealer and insurance agency subsidiaries. OFG s trust division offers various types of individual retirement accounts IRAs and manages Keogh retirement plans and custodian and corporate trust accounts. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total assets managed by OFG s trust division amounted to 2.300 billion and 2.512 billion, respectively. OFG s broker-dealer subsidiary offers a wide array of investment alternatives to its client base, such as tax-advantaged fixed income securities, mutual funds, stocks, bonds and money management wrap-fee programs. At September 30, 2024, total assets managed by the securities broker-dealer and insurance agency subsidiaries from their customers investment accounts amounted to 2.254 billion, compared to 2.446 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in trust and broker-dealer related assets reflects the termination of services by a retirement plan customer during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Goodwill 
 OFG s goodwill is not amortized to expense but is tested at least annually for impairment. A quantitative annual impairment test is not required if, based on a qualitative analysis, OFG determines that the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired. OFG completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31 of each year. OFG tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities, as necessary, to defined reporting units. A fair value is then determined for each reporting unit. If the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values, no write-down of the recorded goodwill is necessary. If the fair values are less than the book values, an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFG had 84.2 million of goodwill allocated as follows: 84.1 million to the banking segment and 100 thousand to the wealth management segment. Please refer to Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the annual goodwill impairment test.

 OFG s loan portfolio is composed of commercial, mortgage, consumer, and auto loans. As shown in Table 6 above, total loans, net, amounted to 7.605 billion at September 30, 2024, a 2.7 increase when compared to 7.402 billion at December 31, 2023. The composition and trends of OFG s loans held-for-investment portfolio were as follows: 
 Commercial loan portfolio amounted to 3.118 billion (40.2 of the gross loan portfolio) compared to 3.077 billion (40.8 of the gross loan portfolio) at December 31, 2023, a 1.3 increase as a result of originations and credit lines usage during 2024. Commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate amounted to 800.9 million and 744.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented 10.3 and 9.9 of our total gross loan portfolio held for investment. Commercial US loans amounted to 680.4 million and 755.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented 8.8 and 10.0 of our total gross loan portfolio held for investment. 
 Commercial loan production decreased by 2 or 3.4 million to 217.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 220.4 million in the prior year quarter, and decreased 17 or 130.3 million to 640.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 770.4 million for the same period of 2023, mainly in the commercial US loan portfolio. Commercial US loans activities include the purchase of middle market senior secured cash flow loan participations and the purchase of participations of loans to small and medium sized businesses. Excluding commercial US loans activities, commercial PR loan production slightly decreased 0.2 to 149.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 150.1 million in the prior year quarter, and increased 13.8 to 528.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 464.2 million for the same period in of 2023. 
 Mortgage loan portfolio amounted to 1.484 billion (19.1 of the gross loan portfolio) compared to 1.563 billion (20.7 of the gross originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2023, a 5.1 decrease resulting from regular paydowns of residential mortgages and securitization of conforming loans into mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage loans included delinquent loans in the GNMA buy-back option program amounting to 41.8 million and 19.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, OFG acquired the servicing rights of a 1.7 billion mortgage loan portfolio that was being subserviced by the Bank. Defaulted loans under the GNMA buy-back option program corresponding to this servicing portfolio amounted to 24.2 million at September 30, 2024. Under the GNMA program, issuers such as OFG have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected (rebooked) on our financial statements with an offsetting liability. 
 Mortgage loan production totaled 37.1 million and 107.8 million in the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which represents an increase of 11 and 8.2 , respectively, from 33.3 million and 99.6 million for the same periods in 2023. 
 OFG follows a conservative residential mortgage lending policy with more than 90 of its residential mortgage portfolio consisting of fixed-rate, fully amortizing, fully documented loans that do not have the level of risk associated with subprime loans offered by certain major US mortgage loan originators. Furthermore, OFG has never been active in negative amortization loans or offered adjustable-rate mortgage loans with teaser rates. 
 84 

Consumer loan portfolio amounted to 664.3 million (8.6 of the gross loan portfolio) compared to 620.4 million (8.2 of the gross loan portfolio) at December 31, 2023. Consumer loan production increased by 13 to 86.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 76.5 million in the prior year quarter, and decreased by 6 , or 14.3 million to 235.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 249.8 million in the same period in 2023. 
 Auto loans portfolio amounted to 2.484 billion (32.1 of the gross loan portfolio) compared to 2.274 billion (30.3 of the gross originated loan portfolio) at December 31, 2023. Auto loans production decreased by 2 to 231.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 237.3 million in the prior year quarter, and increased by 3 or 18.6 million to 714.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 695.9 million in the same period of 2023.

 At September 30, 2024, OFG has 66.2 million of direct credit exposure to the Puerto Rico government, a 2.3 million decrease from 68.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 OFG measures its ACL based on management s best estimate of expected credit losses inherent in OFG s relevant financial assets. Tables 8 through 11 set forth an analysis of activity in the ACL and present selected credit loss statistics for the quarters and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition, Table 6 sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio. 
 Please refer to the Provision for Credit Losses and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates sections in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed analysis of provisions and ACL. 
 Non-performing Assets 
 OFG s non-performing assets include non-performing loans, foreclosed real estate, and other repossessed assets (see Tables 12 and 14). At September 30, 2024, OFG had 74.7 million of non-accrual loans held for investment, including 4.2 million PCD loans, compared to 79.4 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting decreases of 2.5 million and 2.1 million in commercial and auto loan portfolios, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, total past due loans exclude 6.4 million of past due commercial loans held - for - sale, these loans were sold during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. There were no past due commercial loans held-for-sale as of September 30, 2024. 
 On January 1, 2023, OFG adopted ASU 2022-02 related to the elimination of the recognition and measurement of TDRs and the enhancement of disclosures for loan restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty using the prospective transition method. Loans that were restructured in a TDR prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 will continue to be accounted for under the historical TDR accounting until the relevant loans are paid off, liquidated or subsequently modified. 
 Delinquent residential mortgage loans insured or guaranteed under applicable Federal Housing Administration FHA and United States Department of Veterans Affairs VA programs are classified as non-performing loans when they become 90 days or more past due but are not placed in non-accrual status until they become 12 months or more past due, since they are insured loans. Therefore, those loans are included as non-performing loans but excluded from non-accrual loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of these residential mortgage loans was 4.9 million and 5.8 million, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, OFG s non-performing assets decreased by 9.0 to 91.0 million (0.79 total assets) from 100.0 million (0.88 of total assets) at December 31, 2023, mainly non-performing loans and foreclosed real estate. 
 85 

Foreclosed real estate decreased from 10.8 million at December 31, 2023 to 4.4 million at September 30, 2024 and other repossessed assets increased from 4.0 million at December 31, 2023 to 7.0 million at September 30, 2024, both recorded at fair value. OFG does not expect non-performing loans to result in significantly higher losses. At September 30, 2024, the allowance coverage ratio to non-performing loans was 202.9 (189.1 at December 31, 2023). 
 Upon adoption of the CECL methodology, OFG elected to maintain pools of loans that were previously accounted for under ASC 310-30 and will continue to account for these pools as a unit of account. As such, for PCD loans the determination of non-accrual or accrual status is made at the pool level, not the individual loan level. The ACL was determined for each pool and added to the pool s carrying amount to establish a new amortized cost basis. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the pool and the new amortized cost basis is the non-credit premium or discount which will be amortized interest income over the remaining life of the pool. On a quarterly basis, management will monitor the composition and behavior of the pools to assess the ability for cash flow estimation and timing. If based on the analysis performed the pool is classified as non-accrual, the accretion/amortization of the non-credit (discount) premium will cease. 
 The following items comprise non-performing loans held for investment, including Non-PCD and PCDs: 
 Commercial loans - At September 30, 2024, OFG s non-performing commercial loans amounted to 40.0 million (50.3 of OFG s non-performing loans), a 5.9 decrease from 42.5 million at December 31, 2023 (49.9 of OFG s non-performing loans). Non-PCD commercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due and are written down, if necessary, based on the specific evaluation of the underlying collateral, if any. 
 Mortgage loans - At September 30, 2024, OFG s non-performing mortgage loans totaled 19.0 million (23.8 of OFG s non-performing loans), a 6.4 decrease from 20.3 million (23.8 of OFG s non-performing loans) at December 31, 2023. Non-PCD mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due and are written-down, if necessary, based on the specific evaluation of the collateral underlying the loan, except for FHA and VA insured mortgage loans which are placed in non-accrual when they become 12 months or more past due. 
 Consumer loans - At September 30, 2024, OFG s non-performing consumer loans amounted to 3.6 million (4.6 of OFG s non-performing loans), a 7.4 increase from 3.4 million at December 31, 2023 (4.0 of OFG s non-performing loans). Non-PCD consumer loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due and written-off when payments are delinquent 120 days in personal loans and 180 days in credit cards and personal lines of credit. 
 Auto loans - At September 30, 2024, OFG s non-performing auto loans amounted to 17.0 million (21.3 of OFG s total non-performing loans), a decrease of 10.9 from 19.1 million at December 31, 2023 (22.3 of OFG s total non-performing loans). Non-PCD auto loans are placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, partially written-off to collateral value when payments are delinquent 120 days, and fully written-off when payments are delinquent 180 days. 
 OFG has two mortgage loan modification programs. These are the Loss Mitigation Program and the Non-Conforming Mortgage Loan Program. Both programs are intended to help responsible homeowners to remain in their homes and avoid foreclosure, while also reducing OFG s losses on non-performing mortgage loans. 
 The Loss Mitigation Program helps mortgage borrowers who are or will become financially unable to meet the current or scheduled mortgage payments. Loans that qualify under this program are those guaranteed by FHA, VA, USDA Rural Development (RURAL), Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (PRHFA), conventional loans guaranteed by Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC), conventional loans sold to FNMA and FHLMC, and conventional loans retained by OFG. The program offers diversified alternatives such as regular or reduced payment plans, payment moratorium, mortgage loan modification, partial claims (only FHA), short sale, and deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Non-Conforming Mortgage Loan Program is for non-conforming mortgages, including balloon payment, interest-only/interest first, variable interest rate, adjustable interest rate and other qualified loans. Non-conforming mortgage loan portfolios are segregated into the following categories: performing loans that meet secondary market requirement and are refinanced under the credit underwriting guidelines of FHA/VA/FNMA/ FHLMC and performing loans not meeting secondary market guidelines processed pursuant OFG s current credit and underwriting guidelines. OFG achieved an affordable and sustainable monthly payment by taking specific, sequential, and necessary steps such as reducing the interest rate, extending the loan term, capitalizing arrearages, deferring the payment of principal or, if the borrower qualifies, refinancing the loan. 
 In order to apply for any of our loan modification programs, if the borrower is active in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, it must request an authorization from the bankruptcy trustee to allow the loan modification. Borrowers with discharged Chapter 7 bankruptcies may also apply. Loans in these programs are evaluated by designated credit underwriters for financial difficulty modification if OFG grants a concession for legal or economic reasons due to the debtor s financial difficulties.

 Liabilities and Funding Sources 
 As shown in Table 15 above, at September 30, 2024, OFG s total liabilities were 10.143 billion, 0.1 lower than the 10.151 billion reported at December 31, 2023. Deposits and borrowings, OFG s funding sources, amounted to 9.879 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.963 billion at December 31, 2023. Deposits, excluding accrued interest payable, decreased by 152.6 million or 1.6 reflecting a decrease in demand deposits of 190.6 million, brokered deposits of 86.5 million and savings and money market accounts of 68.3 million, offset by an increase in time deposits of 191.9 million. Excluding public fund deposits, retail and commercial deposits decreased 38.7 million and 30.2 million, respectively. 
 In December 2023, OFG received a 1.2 billion deposit in an interest-bearing checking account from an existing long-standing Puerto Rico government client who had an inflow of liquidity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total public fund deposits from various Puerto Rico government municipalities, agencies and corporations amounted to 1.574 billion and 1.616 billion, respectively. These public funds were collateralized with securities and commercial loans amounting to 1.672 billion and 1.645 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, borrowings consist of short and long term FHLB advances amounting to 270.8 million. Borrowings increased by 70.1 million or 34.9 from December 31, 2023 reflecting new FHLB advances taken during the third quarter of 2024 as part of OFG s asset liability management strategies. 
 93 

Stockholders Equity 
 At September 30, 2024, OFG s total stockholders equity was 1.318 billion, a 10.4 increase when compared to 1.193 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase reflects an increase in retained earnings of 98.5 million and legal surplus of 14.0 million, mainly due to 147.8 million in net income, partially offset by 35.3 million in common stock dividends. These variances were partially offset by 22.7 million from higher treasury stock as a result of repurchases of common stock in the aggregate amount of 24.4 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the 50 million stock buy back program announced in January 2024, and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of 34.0 million from favorable market value adjustments on available-for-sale investment securities. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 OFG and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to OFG and the Bank Basel III capital rules are based on the final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of September 30, 2024, the capital ratios of OFG and the Bank continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being well-capitalized under the Basel III capital rules. 
 On January 1, 2020, OFG implemented CECL using the modified retrospective approach, with an impact to capital of 25.5 million, net of its corresponding deferred tax effect. On March 27, 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that OFG adopted to delay for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, OFG added back to common equity tier 1 CET1 capital 100 of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25 of the cumulative quarterly changes in the ACL (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). After two years, starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL are being phased out of CET1 capital over a three-year period. 
 The risk-based capital ratios presented in Table 16 include CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital and leverage capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and are calculated based on the Basel III capital rules related to the measurement of capital, risk-weighted assets and average assets. 
 94 

The following are OFG s consolidated capital, dividends, and stock data, including capital ratios under the Basel III capital rules at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 95 

From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, leverage capital ratio increased from 11.03 to 11.12 , tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and common equity tier 1 capital ratio increased from 14.12 to 14.37 , total risk-based capital ratio increased from 15.37 to 15.63 , and tangible common equity to tangible total assets increased from 9.68 to 10.72 . The increases in regulatory capital ratios reflected an increase in retained earnings from net income, net of dividends, CECL transition and stock repurchases, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets of 454.4 million. Risk-weighted assets increased mainly due to an increase in loans and other assets. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of OFG s total stockholders equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (In thousands, except share or per share information) Total stockholders equity 1,318,132 1,193,480 Goodwill (84,241) (84,241) Other intangible assets (16,260) (20,694) Total tangible common equity (non-GAAP) 1,217,631 1,088,545 Total assets 11,461,382 11,344,453 Goodwill (84,241) (84,241) Core deposit intangible (12,452) (15,848) Customer relationship intangible (3,808) (4,846) Total tangible assets 11,360,881 11,239,518 Tangible common equity to tangible assets 10.72 9.68 Common shares outstanding at end of period 46,558,932 47,065,156 Tangible book value per common share 26.15 23.13 
 The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP measures and, unlike tier 1 capital and common equity tier 1 capital, are not codified in the federal banking regulations. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which OFG calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. To mitigate these limitations, OFG has procedures in place to calculate these measures using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

 In January 2024, OFG announced the approval by the Board of Directors of a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to 50 million. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, OFG repurchased 671,800 shares for a total of 24.4 million at an average price of 36.30 per share. Under the prior stock repurchase program, OFG repurchased 743,699 shares for a total of 18.7 million at an average price of 25.08 per share during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. OFG did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other than through its publicly announced stock repurchase program. 
 At September 30, 2024, the estimated remaining number of shares that may be purchased under the 50 million program is 570,223 and was calculated by dividing the remaining balance of 25.6 million by 44.92 (closing price of OFG s common stock at September 30, 2024). 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Background 
 OFG s risk management policies are established by its Board of Directors (the Board and implemented by management through the adoption of a risk management program, which is overseen and monitored by the Chief Risk Officer, the Board s Risk and Compliance Committee, the executive Risk and Compliance Team, the executive Credit Risk Team, and the executive Asset/Liability Team ALT ). OFG has continued to refine and enhance its risk management program by strengthening policies, processes and procedures necessary to maintain effective risk management. 
 All aspects of OFG s business activities are susceptible to risk. Consequently, risk identification and monitoring are essential to risk management. As discussed in greater detail below, OFG s primary risk exposures include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, operational and concentration risks. 
 
 98 

Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse movements of interest rate or prices. OFG evaluates market risk together with interest rate risk. OFG s financial results and capital levels are constantly exposed to market risk. The Board and management are primarily responsible for ensuring that the market risk assumed by OFG complies with the guidelines established by policies approved by the Board. The Board has delegated the management of this risk to ALT which is composed of certain executive officers from the risk management, treasury and finance areas. One of ALT s primary goals is to ensure that the market risk assumed by OFG is within the parameters established in such policies. 
 
 In March 2023, the market reacted with volatility as a result of the collapse of three large US regional banks, which became the biggest bank failures since 2008, after they experienced a run on deposits mainly driven by a significant decrease in the value of their investments. Market reactions to recession concerns and inflationary pressure, combined with aggressive interest rate increases as part of the FRB s efforts to control inflation during 2022 and 2023, had a significant impact on bond prices, including those guaranteed by the US government or by a US government-sponsored entity. Nevertheless, we believe that OFG has strong capital and liquidity levels that facilitate holding securities until the recovery of their amortized cost basis. We also believe that our market risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market volatility over time and remained strong under these conditions. After the events triggered by such bank failures, our customer deposits base has increased. However, total core deposits at September 30, 2024 were 9.533 billion, down slightly from 9.600 billion at December 31, 2023. The FDIC covers up to 250,000 per account owner by ownership category for retail and commercial deposit accounts. This coverage extends to both principal and accrued interest while the account balance remains within the limits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of our uninsured deposits was 5.005 billion and 4.885 billion, respectively. We have 1.574 billion of deposits from the Puerto Rico government, its instrumentalities and municipalities, which represents 16 of our total deposits as of September 30, 2024, mainly from a 1.2 billion deposit received in December 2023, as we continue to build and strengthen our customer relationships. We have renewed the agreement for the 1.2 billion deposit into an interest-bearing checking account from an existing long-standing Puerto Rico government client through mid-November 2024. These public funds are collateralized with securities and commercial loans amounting to 1.672 billion and 1.645 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The amount of these deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of these entities, as well as on our ability to maintain these customer relationships. We believe that our clients are confident in the resiliency and strong position of the Bank. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is the exposure to decline in earnings or capital due to changes in interest rates. To actively monitor the interest rate risk, the Board of Directors created ALT whose principal responsibilities consist in overseeing the management of the Bank s assets and liabilities to balance its risk exposures. In executing its responsibilities, ALT considers different methods to enhance profitability while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risks by implementing investment, pricing and financial strategies that help manage OFG s vulnerability to changes in interest rates. 
 On a quarterly basis, OFG performs net interest income simulation analysis on a consolidated basis to estimate the potential change in future earnings from projected changes in interest rates. These simulations are carried out over a five-year time horizon, assuming certain upward and downward interest rate movements, achieved during a twelve-month period. Market scenarios that include instantaneous and parallel interest rate movements as well as other scenarios with gradual interest rate ramps, speed of interest rate changes, and changes in the slope of the yield curve are also modeled. In addition to the change in interest rates, the results of the analysis could be affected by prepayments, caps, and floors. Management exercises its best judgment in formulating assumptions regarding events that management can influence such as non-maturity deposits repricing, as well as events outside management s control such as customer behavior on loans and deposits activity and the effects that competition has on both lending and deposits pricing. These assumptions are subjective and, as a result, net interest income simulation results will differ from actual results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management strategies, among other factors. 
 
 OFG uses a software application to project future movements in OFG s balance sheet and income statement. The starting point of the projections generally corresponds to the actual values of the balance sheet on the date of the simulations. The following table presents the results of the simulations for the most likely scenarios at September 30, 2024. The left of the table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve over a 12-month horizon. The base case scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant throughout the forecast period for a static balance sheet and the instantaneous shocks are performed against that yield curve. The right side of the table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from parallel gradual interest rates ramps over a 12-month horizon.

Net Interest Income Risk (one-year projection) Instantaneous Changes in Interest Rates Gradual Changes in Interest Rates Amount Change Percent Change Amount Change Percent Change Change in interest rate (Dollars in thousands) + 50 Basis points 6,084 1.01 2,255 0.38 + 100 Basis points 12,019 2.00 4,576 0.76 + 200 Basis points 23,994 4.00 9,283 1.55 - 50 Basis points (7,685) (1.28) (2,856) (0.48) ' -100 Basis points 
 (15,573) (2.59) (6,333) (1.05) ' -200 Basis points 
 (31,547) (5.25) (13,641) (2.27) 
 The scenarios above are both instantaneous shocks and gradual interest rate ramps that assume balance sheet management will mirror the base case. Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities will perform as anticipated. Additionally, a change in the U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to net interest income than indicated above. OFG strategic management of the balance sheet would be adjusted to accommodate these movements. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag changes in market rates. Also, the ability of many borrowers to service their debts may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. ALT strategies consider all these factors as part of the monitoring of the exposure to interest rate risk. 
 
 Future net interest income could be affected by OFG s investments in callable securities, prepayment risk related to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, and any structured repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB in which it may enter into from time to time. As part of the strategy to limit the interest rate risk and reduce the re-pricing gaps of OFG s assets and liabilities, OFG has executed, in the past, certain transactions which included extending the maturity and the re-pricing frequency of the liabilities to longer terms and using hedge-designated swaps to hedge the variability of future interest cash flows of forecasted wholesale borrowings. At September 30, 2024, OFG did not have derivative instruments. 
 
 Since 2023, OFG has redeployed its high cash levels and maturing treasury positions into longer-term mortgage-backed securities. These moves position OFG s balance sheet better for the expected lower interest rate environment in the last quarter of 2024. 
 
 100 

Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the possibility of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty in a credit-related contract failing to perform in accordance with its terms. The principal source of credit risk for OFG is its lending activities. In Puerto Rico, OFG s principal market, we believe that recent macroeconomic conditions continue to show strength. However, as demonstrated by hurricanes and earthquakes in the past, Puerto Rico is susceptible to natural disasters, which can have a disproportionate impact because of the logistical difficulties of bringing relief to an island far from the United States mainland. The effects of climate change may further increase the risk of natural disasters in the future and the correlative risk that the physical impact of such events could adversely affect our customers, operations, and business. Moreover, the Puerto Rico government s fiscal challenges and Puerto Rico s unique relationship with the United States also complicate any relief efforts after a natural disaster. These events increase credit risk as debtors may no longer be capable of operating their businesses and the collateral securing OFG s loans may suffer significant damages. 
 OFG manages its credit risk through a comprehensive credit policy which we believe establishes sound underwriting standards by monitoring and evaluating loan portfolio quality, and by the constant assessment of reserves and loan concentrations. OFG also employs proactive collection and loss mitigation practices. 
 OFG may also encounter risk of default in relation to its securities portfolio. The securities held by OFG are mostly agency mortgage-backed securities and US Treasury securities. Thus, these instruments are guaranteed by mortgages, a U.S. government-sponsored entity, or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
 OFG s executive Credit Risk Team, composed of its Chief Risk Officer, Chief Credit Officer and other senior executives, has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve OFG s credit risk goals and objectives. Those goals and objectives are set forth in OFG s Credit Policy as approved by the Board. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk of OFG not being able to generate sufficient cash from either assets or liabilities to meet obligations as they become due without incurring substantial losses. The Board has established a policy to manage this risk. OFG s cash requirements principally consist of deposit withdrawals, contractual loan funding, repayment of borrowings as these mature, and funding of new and existing investments as required. 
 OFG s business requires continuous access to various funding sources. Liquidity to support growth in loans held for investment has been fulfilled primarily through growth in customer deposits. OFG s goal is to obtain as much of its funding for loans held for investment and other earning assets as possible from customer deposits, which are generated principally through development of long-term customer relationships. In December 2023, OFG received a 1.2 billion deposit in an interest-bearing checking account from an existing long-standing Puerto Rico government client who had an isolated inflow of liquidity resulting in a total of 1.574 billion and 1.616 billion deposits from the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. OFG is not relying on this deposit as part its long-term funding management strategies, even though these funds could remain in the Bank for a longer period. Deposit volumes as well as the customer deposit base, excluding the Puerto Rico government deposit mentioned above, have remained stable. While OFG is able to fund its operations through deposits as well as through advances from the FHLB and other alternative sources, OFG s business may at times need to rely upon other external wholesale funding sources. OFG has selectively reduced its use of certain wholesale funding sources, such as repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and subordinated notes, but depending on its assets and liabilities management strategies, it could use them in the future. 
 In the ordinary course of OFG s operations, it has entered into certain contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. OFG believes that it will be able to meet its contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, bear variable interest rate and may require payment of a fee. Since the commitments may expire unexercised, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. OFG evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by OFG upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Loan commitments, which represent unused lines of credit, increased to 1.398 billion at September 30, 2024 157.2 million with maturity of one year or less and 1.240 billion with maturity over one year) compared to 1.256 billion at December 31, 2023 111.4 million with maturity of one year or less and 1.144 billion with maturity over one year) as a result of seasonal paydowns of commercial lines of credit, and standby letters of credit provided to customers amounted to 23.9 million and 24.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans sold with recourse at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to 92.6 million and 98.7 million, respectively. 
 101 

In the case of loans serviced by OFG for FNMA, OFG is required to advance to the owners the payment of principal and interest on a scheduled basis for six months even when such payment was not collected from the borrower due to payment forbearance granted or payment delinquency. Such amounts advanced are recorded as a receivable by OFG and are expected to be collected from the borrower and/or government agency (FNMA). At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of funds advanced by OFG under such mortgage loan servicing agreements was approximately 4.5 million (December 31, 2023 - 4.2 million). To the extent the mortgage loans underlying OFG s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies, OFG would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFG maintained other non-credit commitments amounting to 17.4 million and 18.9 million, primarily for the acquisition of other investments. Most of these investment funds have a five-year investment period expiring on or before November 2027. These cash requirements are expected to be satisfied with OFG s unrestricted cash. In addition, as we continue to transform OFG with a focus on simplification and building a culture of excellence and customer service, we continue to invest in technology. Some of our technology investments are integrated at our long-term financial plan and required to continuously upgrade our systems. Others require us to focus our technology on investments that drive our strategy, namely digital, data analytics, cloud migration, cyber security, and our sales and service capabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OFG had commitments for capital expenditures in technology amounting to 1.0 million and 7.8 million, respectively, which are expected to be satisfied with OFG s unrestricted cash. 
 OFG expects to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. Our liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market volatility in the past, as with the Covid-19 pandemic and the disruption in the banking industry caused by certain high-profile bank failures in 2023. Liquidity has grown from the federal stimulus programs Puerto Rico has received following Hurricane Maria in 2017, the January 2020 earthquakes, the Covid-19 pandemic, and Hurricane Fiona in 2022. However, liquidity can be further affected by a number of factors such as counterparty willingness or ability to extend credit, regulatory actions and customer preferences, some of which are beyond our control. With the current economic uncertainty resulting from inflation, recent geopolitical events, and recessionary risk in the US, we continue monitoring our liquidity position, specifically cash on hand to meet customer demands. 
 In addition, as OFG is a holding company, separate from the Bank, OFG s primary sources of liquidity are dividends received from the Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Management believes that these limitations will not impact OFG s ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
 Although OFG expects to have continued access to credit from the foregoing sources of funds, there can be no assurance that such financing sources will continue to be available or will be available on favorable terms. In a period of financial disruption or if negative developments occur with respect to OFG, the availability and cost of OFG s funding sources could be adversely affected. In that event, OFG s cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing its net interest income, or OFG may need to dispose of a portion of its investment portfolio, which depending upon market conditions, could result in realizing a loss or experiencing other adverse accounting consequences upon any such dispositions. OFG s efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global or US securities markets or other reductions in liquidity driven by OFG or market-related events. In the event that such sources of funds are reduced or eliminated and OFG is not able to replace these on a cost-effective basis, OFG may be forced to curtail or cease its loan origination business and treasury activities, which would have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial condition. 
 As of September 30, 2024, OFG had approximately 680.6 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, 921.7 million in investment securities that are not pledged as collateral, 402.8 million in borrowing capacity at the FHLB and a secured line of credit through the FRB discount window with 2.076 billion in loans pledged (borrowing capacity 1.601 billion). 
 
 102 

Operational Risk 
 Operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel and systems or from external events. All functions, products and services of OFG are susceptible to operational risk. 
 OFG faces ongoing and emerging risk and regulatory pressure related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products and services. Coupled with external influences such as the risk of natural disasters, market conditions, security risks, and legal risks, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, OFG has developed, and continues to enhance, specific internal controls, policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization. The purpose of these policies and procedures is to provide reasonable assurance that OFG s business operations are functioning within established limits. OFG also maintains a cybersecurity risk management framework in place to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. Refer to Item 1C. Cybersecurity in our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion on OFG s cybersecurity risk management framework. 
 OFG classifies operational risk into two major categories: business specific and corporate-wide affecting all business lines. For business specific risks, a risk assessment group works with the various business units to ensure consistency in policies, processes and assessments. With respect to corporate-wide risks, such as information security, business recovery, legal and compliance, OFG has specialized groups, such as Information Security, Enterprise Risk Management, Legal and Corporate Compliance, Information Technology, and Operations. These groups assist our lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of our business groups. All these matters are reviewed and discussed by the executive Risk and Compliance Team and the executive Consumer Compliance Team. OFG also has a Business Continuity Plan to address situations where its capacity to perform critical functions is affected. Under such circumstances, a Crisis Management Team is activated to restore such critical functions within established timeframes. 
 OFG is subject to extensive United States federal and Puerto Rico regulations, and OFG has established and continues to enhance procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. OFG has a corporate compliance function headed by the General Counsel who reports to the Chief Executive Officer and supervises the BSA Officer and Corporate Compliance Director. The General Counsel is responsible for the oversight of regulatory compliance and implementation of a company-wide compliance program, including the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering compliance program. 
 As a result of the 2023 bank failures, regulatory agencies may propose certain actions, including reforms to existing regulatory and prudential frameworks that may impose different capital and liquidity requirements, including increased requirements to issue debt or raise capital. In November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of the bank failures. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based on a calculation using an insured depository institution s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. In particular, the special assessment was imposed on insured depository institutions based on their estimated uninsured deposits in excess of 5 billion at December 31, 2022. Given that OFG had uninsured deposits under 5 billion, this special assessment did not apply to us. However, in the future there may be additional special assessments imposed on insured depository institutions that may apply to us. It is not yet possible to quantify the scope of any of these actions or the potential impact on our operations. 
 Concentration Risk 
 Most of OFG s business activities and a significant portion of its credit exposure are concentrated in Puerto Rico. As a consequence, OFG s profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by an extended economic slowdown, adverse political, fiscal or economic developments in Puerto Rico, or the effects of a natural disaster, all of which could result in a reduction in loan originations, an increase in non-performing assets, an increase in foreclosure losses on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of its loans and loan servicing portfolio. 
 103 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 OFG s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of OFG s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of OFG s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, OFG s disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance of effectiveness in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by OFG in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within OFG to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in OFG s periodic reports. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in OFG s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, OFG s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART - II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 . LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 OFG and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings incidental to their business. OFG is vigorously contesting such claims. Based upon a review by legal counsel and the development of these matters to date, management is of the opinion that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, resulting from these claims will not have a material adverse effect on OFG s financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, except as set forth in our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. In addition to other information set forth in this quarterly report, you should carefully consider the risk factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K, as updated by this report or other filings we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to OFG at this time or OFG currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect OFG s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 In January 2024, OFG s Board of Directors approved a new 50.0 million stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase program, which is open-ended, replaces the prior stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in January 2022, which had 17.2 million remaining of its 100.0 million repurchase parameters. Any shares of common stock repurchased are held by OFG as treasury shares. OFG records treasury stock purchases under the cost method 
 whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, OFG repurchased 2,600 shares for a total of 104 thousand at an average price of 40.02 per share. 
 
 104 

The table below sets forth the information with respect to purchases of our common stock made by or on behalf of OFG during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, excluding the months of July and September during which no shares were repurchased as part of the stock repurchase program: 
 Period Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs Maximum approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the programs (In thousands, except per share data) 8/1/2024 - 8/31/2024 2,600 40.02 2,600 25,614 Total 2,600 40.02 2,600 25,614 
 The estimated remaining number of shares that may be purchased under the current 50 million stock buyback program is estimated at 570,223 and was calculated by dividing the remaining balance of 25.6 million by 44.92 (closing price of OFG common stock at September 30, 2024). OFG did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 other than through its publicly announced stock repurchase program.
