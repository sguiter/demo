3 Revenue Recognition (Continued) 

Transaction
Price 

The
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services
to the customer. Revenue is recorded based on the transaction price, which includes fixed consideration. The Company s contracts
do not include variable consideration. 

Contract
Balances 

The
timing of revenue recognition generally aligns with the right to invoice the customer. The Company records accounts receivable when it
has the unconditional right to issue an invoice and receive payment, regardless of whether revenue has been recognized. The balance in
accounts receivable at January 1, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. Deferred revenue is recognized on the consolidated
balance sheets when cash payments are received in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligation. Deferred revenue is recognized
as revenue on the consolidated statements of operations when the Company satisfies its performance obligation to the customer. Balances
in deferred revenue at January 1, 2024 and 2023 were - - and , respectively. Revenue recognized from amounts included in deferred
revenue at the beginning of the period was - - and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and
 - - and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not have any contract assets. 

Costs
to Obtain a Contract 

The
Company did not incur costs of obtaining contracts expected to benefit longer than one year. As a result, there are capitalized contract
acquisition costs as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Warranties 

The
buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the date of shipment to inspect and either accept or reject. If goods are rejected, written notice
of rejection and the specific reasons therefore must be sent to the Company within such thirty (30) day period after receipt. Failure
to reject goods or to notify the Company of errors, shortages, or other non-compliance with the agreement within such thirty (30) day
period shall constitute irrevocable acceptance of goods and admission that they fully comply with the agreement.

related to the acquisition of equipment and an intangible asset recorded on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. This payment was
not made by the due date due to ongoing negotiations with the counterparty regarding certain terms of the contract. 

The contract stipulates that
if the payment is not made, the counterparty has the right to reclaim the rights to both the equipment and intangible asset. However,
management is in discussions with the counterparty and believes that the payment will be made in the near future without consequence to
the rights of the equipment or intangible asset. 

As of the date of this filing, management
does not believe that an impairment of the equipment or intangible asset is necessary, and no adjustments have been made to the carrying
value of the assets on the balance sheet. Management will continue to monitor the situation and will assess the implications on the financial
statements as additional information becomes available.

Overview 

Syntec
Optics is vertically integrated from design and component manufacturing for lens system assembly to imaging module integration for system
solutions. Making our own tools, molding, and nanomachining allows close interaction and recut ability, enabling special techniques to
hold tolerances up to sub-micron level. Syntec has assembled a world class design for manufacturability team to augment its production
team with deep expertise to fully leverage our vertical integration from component making to optics and electronics assembly. Syntec
Optics has steadily developed variety of other complementary manufacturing techniques to provide a wide suite of horizontal capabilities
including thin films deposition coatings, glass molding, polymer molding, tool-making, mechanicals manufacturing, and nanomachining. 

Syntec
became a leader in the industry by pioneering polymer-based optics and then subsequently adding glass optics and optics made from other
materials including crystals and metals. Polymer-based optics provide numerous advantages compared to incumbent glass-based optics. Polymer-based
optics are smaller, lower weight, lower cost, and offer very high-performance optical solutions. For all these reasons, Syntec is able
to deliver products to our clients that are lighter, smaller, and suitable for cutting edge technology products, including the newly
evolving silicon photonics industry. 

Our
designs and assembly processes are developed in-house in the United States. In 2016, Syntec Optics expanded its manufacturing facility
to nearly 90,000 square-feet, allowing us to increase our production capacity and offer additional advanced manufacturing processes under
one roof which provide us the ability to increase sales to existing customers and increase penetration of our end-markets. Our facility
provides a streamlined, partially autonomous production process for our current customers, which comprises optical assembly, electro-optics
assembly, polymer optics molding, glass optics molding, opto-mechanical assembly, nanomachining and thin films coating. Our facility
also provides availability to expand the number of advanced manufacturing processes to handle increased volumes of existing and new customer
orders. 

Syntec
Optics focuses on four end markets of defense, medical, consumer, and communications all with several mission-critical applications with
strong tailwinds. 

In
2023, Syntec Optics launched low weight night vision optics and further, announced hybrid light-weight magnifier and thermal clip on
in the defense end market. Also, in 2023, Syntec Optics announced biomedical mirrors for sensing in the medical end market. Rounding
out new product launches for 2023, in the communication end market, Syntec Optics launched microlens arrays and low earth satellite optics. 

The
Business Combination 

On
November 7, 2023, or the Closing Date, we consummated the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Merger
Sub merged with and into Legacy Syntec, with Legacy Syntec surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of OmniLit.
Thereafter, Merger Sub ceased to exist and OmniLit was renamed Syntec Optics Holdings, Inc. Legacy Syntec is deemed the accounting acquirer,
which means that Legacy Syntec s financial statements for previous periods will be disclosed in our future periodic reports filed
with the SEC. Following the Business Combination, our business is the business of Legacy Syntec. 

The
Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, OmniLit was treated as the acquired
company for financial statement reporting purposes.

Key
Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 

Our
financial position and results of operations depend to a significant extent on the following factors: 

End
Market Consumers 

The
demand for our products ultimately depends on demand from customers in our current end markets. We generate sales through (1) Tier 1
suppliers and (2) through OEMs. 

An
increasing proportion of our sales has been and is expected to continue to be derived from sales to defense. biomedical and industrial/consumer
OEMs, driven by continued efforts to develop and expand sales to OEMs with whom we have longstanding relationships. Future OEM sales
will be subject to risks and uncertainties, including the number of defense, biomedical and industrial/consumer products these OEMs manufacture
and sell, which in turn may be driven by the expectations these OEMs have around end market demand. 

Demand
from end markets is impacted by a number of factors, including travel restrictions (global pandemics or geo-political conflicts), fuel
costs and energy demands (including an increasing trend towards the use of green energy), as well as overall macro-economic conditions.
Sales of our optics and photonics enabled components and sub-components have also benefited from the increased global conflict, the United
States dynamic relationships with other world powers that may have a conflicting view with western-style democracy, the movement towards
reshoring of advanced manufacturing, biomedical components and sub-components needed to support physicians in their battle against global
pandemics, and the increased global demand for high-fidelity data communications on all corners of the globe. 

Syntec
Optics plans to further add bolt-on acquisitions for inorganic growth in the fragmented photonics industry by expanding our portfolio
of our existing, U.S.-based, advanced manufacturing processes of making thin-film coated glass, crystal, or polymer components and their
housings, which are ultimately assembled into high performance hybrid electro-optics sub-systems. By doing so, Syntec Optics plans to
grow to the new end markets of communications and sensing. Syntec Optics entered the communications end market in 2023. Syntec Optics
is currently engaged as a supplier for a U.S. Department of Commerce s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) funded
research and development project for the sensing end market. The communication end market is characterized by the use of optics and photonics
for data transmittal and reception of information, including, for example, satellite communications and other associated applications.
The sensing end-market is characterized by the use of optics and photonics to detect scattered light or light with an altered refractive
index due to the presence of a medium within a wide range of potential applications, including, for example, disease detection and other
associated applications. 

Supply 

We
currently rely on strategically selected electronics, highly engineered polymers and aluminum manufacturers located in the United States
to manufacture our highly specialized optic and photonics enabled components and sub-components, and we intend to continue to rely on
these suppliers going forward. Our close working relationships with our Unites States based suppliers, reflected in our ability to (x)
increase our purchase order volumes (qualifying us for related volume-based discounts) and (y) order and receive delivery of raw materials
in anticipation of required demand, has helped us moderate increased supply-related costs associated with inflation and to avoid potential
shipment delays. To mitigate against potential adverse production events, we opted to build our inventory of key raw materials. In connection
with these stockpiling activities, we experienced an increase in prepaid inventory compared to prior periods as suppliers required upfront
deposits in response to supply chain disruptions. 

As
a result of the active steps we have taken to manage our inventory levels, we have not been subject to the shortages or price impacts
that have been present for manufacturers of optic and photonic enabled components or sub-components. 

Product
and Customer Mix 

Our
sales consist of sales of highly specialized optic and photonic enabled components and sub-components. These products are sold to different
customer types (e.g., OEMs and Tier 1 manufacturers) and at different prices and involve varying levels of costs. In any particular period,
changes in the mix and volume of particular products sold and the prices of those products relative to other products will impact our
average selling price and our cost of goods sold. The price of our products may also increase as a result of increases in the cost of
components due to inflation, labor and raw materials. The Company generated 53 of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from
three customers and 41 of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from two customers. In addition, revenues from these larger
customers may fluctuate from time to time based on these customers business needs and customer experience, the timing of which
may be affected by market conditions or other factors outside of our control. These customers have a broad product purchase mix across
various departments of Syntec Optics. Syntec Optics supplies several mission critical components and sub-components to these customers
that are not tied to a single application, customer initiative, or purchase order. We expect sales to increase as we further advance
our full-system design expertise and product offerings and customers increasingly demand more sophisticated systems, rather than drop-in
replacements. In addition to the impacts attributable to the general sales mix across our products, our results of operations are impacted
by the relative margins of products sold. As we continue to introduce new products at varying price points, our overall gross margin
may vary from period to period as a result of changes in product and customer mix. 

Production
Capacity 

All
of our design, advanced manufacturing and assembly currently takes place at our nearly 90,000 square foot headquarters and manufacturing
facility located in Rochester, New York. We currently operate optical, opto-mechanical and electro-optical assembly lines in addition
to molding, nanomachining, testing and thin-film production lines. Consistent with our operating history, we plan to continue to automate
additional aspects of our advanced manufacturing operations. Our existing facility has the capacity to add additional production lines
and construct and operate pilot production lines for new components and sub-components, all designed to maximize the capacity of our
manufacturing facility. Although our automation efforts are expected to reduce our costs of goods, we may not fully recognize the anticipated
savings when planned and could experience additional costs or disruptions to our production activities. 

15 

Competition 

We
compete with traditional glass optic manufacturers and electro-optic manufacturers, who primarily either import their products or components
or manufacture products under a private label. As we continue to expand into new markets, develop new products and move towards production
of our polymer based and glass-polymer based optic hybrids and photonics enabled components and sub-components, we will experience competition
with a wider range of companies. These competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources
to the development of their current and future technologies. Our competitors may be able to source materials and components at lower
costs, which may require us to evaluate measures to reduce our own costs, lower the price of our products or increase sales volumes in
order to maintain our expected levels of profitability. 

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development are primarily focused on the advanced manufacturing of polymer and glass-polymer based optic and photonics enabled
components and sub-components. The next stage in our technical development is to construct our products to optimize performance, lower
weight and increase longevity to meet and exceed industry standards for our target end markets. Ongoing testing and optimizing of more
complicated systems and sub-systems for our existing end markets will assist us in increasing penetration in our current end markets
and expanding into targeted end markets.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial
statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
On a recurring basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects
of material revisions in an estimate, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date
of the change in the estimate. 

We
believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements. 

Inventory
Valuation 

We
periodically review physical inventory for excess, obsolete, and potentially impaired items and reserves. Any such inventory is written
down to net realizable value. The reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is dependent on expected future use and requires
management judgement. 

Warrants 

We
account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific
terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition
of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including
whether the warrants are indexed to our own ordinary share, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which
requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end
date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of additional paid-in-capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. 

18 

Income
Taxes 

We
account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

We
recognize the financial statement effect of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical
merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that
is greater than 50 likely to be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount, which
in the opinion of management is more likely than not to be realized. 

Management
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance
recorded against our deferred tax assets. We consider factors such as the cumulative income or loss in recent years; reversal of deferred
tax liabilities; projected future taxable income exclusive of temporary differences; the character of the income tax asset, including
income tax positions; tax planning strategies and the period over which we expect the deferred tax assets to be recovered in the determination
of the valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or we adjust our estimates in the future, we
may need to adjust our valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

This
Quarterly Report includes a non-generally accepted account principles within the United States U.S. GAAP measure that
we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other income,
tax and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring items, and business combination
expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe is useful to investors and analysts because it illustrates the underlying
financial and business trends relating to our core, recurring results of operations and enhances comparability between periods. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and is not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as
calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within
the same industry. Investors should exercise caution in comparing our non-GAAP measure to any similarly titled measure used by other
companies. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain items required by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to information
reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

We
define adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net earnings (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense,
depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude non-recurring items. We utilize adjusted EBITDA as an internal performance measure
in the management of our operations because we believe the exclusion of these non-cash and non-recurring charges allow for a more relevant
comparison of our results of operations to other companies in our industry and is in accordance with the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Compliance Disclosure Interpretations (Reference Question 102.03). 

The company has identified several non-recurring items included in our
non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA financial measure. These items encompass management fees, professional transaction fees, technology start-up
costs, optical molding evaluation expenses, glass molding evaluation expenses, and executive transition expenses. Notably, several projects
were concluded during the three months ended September 30, 2024, while some expenses were incurred in prior periods. The company evaluated
these projects and retroactively adjusted prior periods to account for these expenses. This retroactive adjustment is reflected in the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, below. 

The
table below presents our adjusted EBITDA, reconciled to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including
working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations and other commitments. We assess liquidity in terms of our
cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources
of liquidity were cash totaling 0.5 million and a line of credit with 3.9 million available. 

Significant
factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability
to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and
could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences
of global pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, monetary policy changes in the U.S. and other countries and their impact on the global
financial markets, supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our
ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our
revolving credit facility, and other market changes in general. See Risks Relating to Syntec Optics Financial Position
and Capital Requirements included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by
operating activities of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers for the year-over-year change
include an increase in net loss of 1.9 million, a decrease in federal income tax payable of 0.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable and
accrued expenses of 1.6 million, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 1.3 million and an increase in deferred revenue of 0.4 million.

Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in
investing activities of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used in investing activities
decreased primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures of 0.4 million and an increase in proceeds from sale of equipment of
 0.3 million. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 0.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The primary drivers for the year-over-year change include an increase in borrowing of debt obligations of 1.1 million, a decrease
in repayments on debt obligations of 0.3 million, offset by an increase in repayments on the line of credit of 0.6 million, and an increase
in repayments on finance lease obligations of 0.1 million. 

ITEM
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Our
primary market risk exposure is interest rate sensitivity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes
to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following identified material weaknesses: 

1. 
 We lack documentation of
 formal internal control process and controls including lack of review of journal entries. 

2. 
 We lack necessary corporate
 accounting resources to maintain adequate segregation of duties. 

3. 
 We lack timely reconciliation
 controls in the areas of accounts payable, accrued legal expenses, and inventory. 

4. 
 We lack controls related
 to proper cut-off of costs of goods sold and other income from business interruption claim. 

5. 
 We lack control related
 to identification and disclosure of related party transactions. 

6. 
 We lack control related
 to proper fair value methodology utilized for valuation of complex financial instrument in connection with contingent earnout arrangement. 

7. 
 We lack the necessary information
 technology IT general controls infrastructure in the areas of user access and program change-management due to insufficient
 documentation and training, and inadequate IT risk assessment process. Additionally, we lack controls around the review of SOC-1
 reports and lack of cyber security related controls. 

8. 
 We
 lack control related to the evaluation and calculation of finance leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 842-20-25-1a. 

The
Company is instituting controls and procedures that we expect will improve the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

This
Report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly
public companies. Additionally, our auditors will not be required to formally opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the material weaknesses and remediation efforts mentioned above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding,
investigation or claim, or other legal exposure that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business,

as it appears on the records of the Corporation and shall be given: (a) if mailed, when notice is deposited in the U.S. mail, postage
prepaid; and (b) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at such stockholder s address.
So long as the Corporation is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission s proxy rules set forth in Regulation 14A under
the Exchange Act, notice shall be given in the manner required by such rules. To the extent permitted by such rules, or if the Corporation
is not subject to Regulation 14A, notice may be given by electronic transmission directed to the stockholder s electronic mail
address, and if so given, shall be given when directed to such stockholder s electronic mail address unless the stockholder has
notified the Corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice
is prohibited by Section 232(e) of the DGCL. If notice is given by electronic mail, such notice shall comply with the applicable provisions
of Sections 232(a) and 232(d) of the DGCL. Notice may be given by other forms of electronic transmission with the consent of a stockholder

or these Bylaws, a written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic transmission by such person,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of
the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted

reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof that
authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his, her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (a) the material
facts as to his, her or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board
or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority
of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; (b) the material facts as to his, her
or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote

ARTICLE

INDEMNIFICATION 

Section
8.1: Right to Indemnification . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is
otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an Indemnitee ), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection
with such proceeding; provided, however , that, except as provided in Section 8.3 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights
to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. 

Section
8.2: Right to Advancement of Expenses . In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 8.1, an Indemnitee shall
also have the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law the expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition
(hereinafter an advancement of expenses ); provided, however , that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement
of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon the Corporation s receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf
of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise. 

Section
8.3: Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit . If a claim under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within
60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses,
in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense
of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled
to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final
adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement
of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden
of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise
shall be on the Corporation. 

Section
8.4: Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The rights provided to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any
other right, which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws,
an agreement, a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 

Section
8.5: Insurance . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability
or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the
DGCL. 

Section
8.6: Indemnification of Other Persons . This Article VIII shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner
authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the indemnification
and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees under this Article VIII. 

Section
8.7: Amendments . Any repeal or amendment of this Article VIII by the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in
applicable law, or the adoption of any other provision of these Bylaws inconsistent with this Article VIII, will, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in applicable law permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights to Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish
or adversely affect any right or protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment
or adoption of such inconsistent provision; provided, however , that amendments or repeals of this Article VIII shall require the
affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation. 

Section
8.8: Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Article VIII, (a) references to other enterprise shall
include any employee benefit plan; (b) references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall
include any service that imposes duties on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants,
or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interest
of the Corporation for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL. 

Section
8.9: Contract Rights . The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall
continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee s
heirs, executors and administrators.
