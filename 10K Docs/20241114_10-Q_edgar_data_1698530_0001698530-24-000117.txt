All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, could, will, would, should, expect, plan, , anticipate, believe, estimate, intend, predict, seek, contemplate, project, continue, potential, ongoing or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to such statements. 
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, such expectations or any of the forward-looking statements may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors set forth in Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors below and for the reasons described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this report are made as of the date hereof and we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 
 substantial uncertainties regarding our exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including whether we are able to identify potential partners and consummate transactions, in a timely manner or at all, whether we would be able to obtain sufficient funding to complete this process and whether any such transactions would generate value for stockholders; 
 our ability to raise the substantial additional capital that is needed in the very near term to fund our operations and our pursuit of strategic alternatives, particularly given our current lack of a significant, ongoing revenue source or committed financing and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; 
 whether we receive any royalties or license fees in the future from our historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets, which we sold in September 2024; 
 
 our ability to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq ), including the ability to maintain minimum stockholders equity and stock price, and comply with applicable governance requirements, among other requirements, for continued listing on Nasdaq and demonstrate our ability to maintain long-term compliance to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel in connection with our pending appeal to the Panel of a delisting determination from the Nasdaq staff; 
 
 our ability to close the investments by HiTron Systems, Inc. in a timely manner, including our ability to obtain stockholder approval of the second 8.7 million investment and to otherwise satisfy all closing conditions with respect thereto; 
 
 any strategic plan or alternative that we may identify and pursue may involve unexpected costs, liabilities and/or delays and may not deliver anticipated benefits to our stockholders; 
 our estimates of expenses, use of cash, timing of future cash needs, ongoing losses and capital requirements may prove to be inaccurate; 
 uncertainty about reaction from investors and potential business partners to our recent changes of control and board and management composition and the future direction of the Company, and the ability of our controlling stockholders and new board members and management to earn the confidence of investors and potential partners despite limited experience with U.S. public companies, and how these factors may impact our ability to obtain funding and execute any strategic alternatives that we may identify;

Table of Contents 

potential additional turnover of senior management, and any inability to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, creates significant continuity risk and could impair our ability to raise capital and execute on our exploration of strategic alternatives; 
 our ability to comply with all applicable laws, which may be particularly challenging given the recent turnover in our board and management, significant reductions in force, limited resources and the potential to enter into new business areas with which we have no past experience; 
 our ability to operate our business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others; 
 the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including global inflation, actions taken by central banks to counter inflation, capital market and bank instability, exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions and energy and fuel prices; 
 the impact of government laws and regulations; and 
 other factors that may impact our financial results and condition and our ongoing strategic efforts. 
 These statements relate to future events or our future operational or financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those listed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

. Management believes that, given the Company s current cash position, operating plans and forecasted negative cash flows from operating activities over the next twelve months, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financial statements are issued. Substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations. 
 Management believes that the Company s existing cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to continue to fund its operating expenses and additional funding is needed in the very near term. The Company has already engaged in significant cost reductions, so our ability to further cut costs and extend the Company s operating runway is limited. As a result, substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company in the very near term to pay expenses, fund the ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives and pursue any alternatives that may be identified. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available and, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared as though the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following information should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial information and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on June 6, 2024. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our actual results, performance or experience could differ materially from what is indicated by any forward-looking statement due to various important factors, risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors including, but not limited to, those identified in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other SEC filings. 
 
 Overview 
 Historically, we were an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets. In September 2022, we announced a significant reduction in force, suspension of preclinical activities and halting of all research and development, and that we were exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. In February 2024, the Company received an upfront payment of 500 from a licensing agreement for patents related to one of our historical drug candidates, and received a small, one-time payment and an entitlement to only modest royalties on future sales of the licensed technology that we do not believe will be material. In the second quarter, we recognized other income of 637 from the sale of our samples related to the licensed product. In the third quarter, we sold our historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets (including the licensing agreement described above) pursuant to the purchase agreement and recognized other income of 1,500. We continue to engage in a broader exploration of strategic alternatives. This effort involves exploring growth through transactions with potential partners that see opportunity in joining an existing, publicly-traded organization. 
 Following the purchase agreement, any value we may generate from our historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets will be primarily through royalties and license fees that we may receive in the future under the purchase agreement. However, whether we receive any royalties or licenses fees, and the amounts and timing thereof, are uncertain and out of our control. 
 Because we currently have no source of significant, ongoing revenue or committed financing, we will require substantial additional funding in the very near term in order to continue to operate and continue our exploration of strategic alternatives and consummate any transactions that we may identify. 
 Operating, financing, and cash flow considerations 
 Since our inception in 2011, we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our securities, loans and collaborations. On February 24, 2023, we raised gross proceeds of 5.4 million on the closing of the Private Placement (as defined below) (or net proceeds of approximately 4.6 million after transaction expenses). However, we already used these net proceeds for severance payments, warrant put payments, acquisition of the Notes Receivable, payroll, and general working capital purposes as we pursue strategic alternatives. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 0.3 million. 
 Our current liquidity is not sufficient to continue to fund operations. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial additional financing will be needed in the very near term to fund our operations and exploration of strategic alternatives and pursue any alternatives that we identify. If we are unable to raise capital, the Company may seek bankruptcy protection and/or cease operations in the near term, which may result in the Company s stockholders receiving no or very little value in respect of their shares of the Company s common stock. 
 We expect to seek financing through equity offerings. However, it may be difficult to obtain financing given the Company s current condition and uncertainty over its future direction. Therefore, we may be unable to raise capital

at all or on favorable terms. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to continue operations. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Change of Control 
 On September 26, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement with CBI USA, Inc. CBI USA ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to CBI USA in a private placement an aggregate of 680,000 shares of Common Stock, at a purchase price of 8.00 per share. The private placement closed on February 24, 2023 (the Closing Date ). 
 CBI USA funded the acquisition pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement through a loan from its affiliate, DGP Co., Ltd. DGP ). On June 23, 2023, DGP exercised its the option pursuant to the loan and acquired the 680,000 shares of Common Stock initially acquired by CBI USA pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. DGP subsequently agreed to sell its shares to a third party, with the closing of 10 (68,000 shares) occurring in February 2024 and the remainder to close by or on October 31, 2024. The sale of the remainder did not close on October 31, 2024. However, on October 31, 2024, DGP agreed to sell 612,000 shares to two different third parties, with such sales expected to close by February 2025 subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 The Securities Purchase Agreement, as confirmed and clarified by that certain letter agreement, dated October 31, 2022, between the Company and CBI USA, provided CBI USA together with its affiliates and any group of which it or they are a member with the right to designate directors to the Company s board of directors in proportion to the ownership of CBI USA and its affiliates and any such group. CBI USA and DGP have announced they expect to exercise such rights as a group. Together, they beneficially own 47 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock based on their most recent Schedule 13D amendment. 
 In an agreement dated November 6, 2024 and executed November 12, 2024, the Company agreed to sell and issue to HiTron Systems Inc. HiTron 433,333 shares of common stock for 1,300. This agreement provides HiTron with director appointment rights and the appointment of a Chief Restructuring Officer upon closing, which is expected to occur within 10 days from its execution. On November 13, 2024, in a subsequent agreement, the Company agreed to sell and issue to HiTron 2,900,000 additional shares of common stock for 8,700. The closing of the investment pursuant to this subsequent agreement is conditioned on stockholder approval, among other customary conditions. 
 Nasdaq Listing Requirements Deficiency Notice 
 As previously disclosed, the Company has received numerous deficiency notices with respect to various Nasdaq listing requirements in the past year. These related to: 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price rule due to the Company s stock trading below 1.00 for a sustained period of time. The Company effected a one-for-thirty reverse stock split on June 29, 2022 in order to attempt to raise the stock price. On September 13, 2023, the Company received a delinquency notification that the closing bid price of the Company s stock traded below 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The Company effected a one-for-five reverse stock split on August 27, 2024 in order to attempt to raise the stock price. On September 13, 2024, the Company received a letter received from Nasdaq noting it met the closing bid price requirement. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s rule requiring stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 based on the Company s balance sheet as of June 30, 2024. The Company is not in compliance with this requirement based on its September 30, 2024 balance sheet. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s corporate governance requirements with respect to board and committee composition. The Company has received numerous deficiency notifications with respect to these requirements in the past year. Although the Company believes it is currently in compliance, there can be no assurance it will remain in compliance.

Compliance with Nasdaq s requirement to hold an annual meeting. On January 11, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it did not comply with listing requirements by not holding an annual meeting in 2023. The Company held its combined 2023 and 2024 annual meeting on June 28, 2024. 
 On April 17, 2024, the Company received a delinquency notification as it had not filed its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The extended deadline for compliance was established by Nasdaq at May 20, 2024, the same deadline for our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Annual Report Form 10-K was filed on June 6, 2024. 
 Although the Company filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 prior to the extended deadline of May 20, 2024, on May 21, 2024, the Company received a delisting determination from the Nasdaq staff as a result of not filing its Annual Report Form 10-K by the May 20, 2024 deadline and failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (which was subsequently filed on June 17, 2024). The staff s delisting determination also noted the failure to hold its 2023 annual meeting as another basis of the delisting determination. 
 On May 28, 2024, the Company requested an appeal of the delisting determination to Nasdaq s Hearings Panel Panel ), and the hearing took place on July 9, 2024. On July 31, 2024, the Company received formal notice that the Panel determined to continue the Company s listing subject to the Company evidencing compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market by September 16, 2024. The Company received an additional extension to November 14, 2024 to satisfy the terms of the Panel s decision and to ensure the Company s continued listing on Nasdaq. 
 As the Company will not meet Nasdaq s listing requirements as of September 30, 2024, the Company has requested another extension by the Panel to demonstrate compliance. We cannot provide assurance that the Panel will determine to continue the Company s listing at the November 14, 2024 expiration of the current extension or that, if another extension is granted, that we will be able to meet the Panel s requirements by the deadline. 
 Even if the Company regains compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements and satisfied the Panel s requirements, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with Nasdaq s requirements and will not be delisted. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On August 26, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the Amendment, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a one-for-five (1-for-5) reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The Amendment became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 27, 2024. 
 The Amendment provided that, at the effective time of the Amendment, every five (5) shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share. The reverse stock split effected all shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Amendment. As a result of the reverse stock split, proportionate adjustments have been made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted share unit award issued by us and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Amendment, which resulted in a proportionate decrease in the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted share unit award, and, in the case of stock options, a proportionate increase in the exercise price of all such stock options. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans immediately prior to the effective time of the Amendment was reduced proportionately. 
 No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share received a full share in lieu thereof. The reverse stock split affected all stockholders proportionately and did not affect any stockholder s percentage ownership of our common stock (except to the extent that the reverse stock split results in any stockholder owning only a fractional share).

Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on August 28, 2024. The new CUSIP number for our common stock following the reverse stock split is 30205M 309. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 
 We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. This includes estimates where the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material.

The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mostly due to lower expenses as a result of reduced operations and higher costs in 2023 resulting from the separation costs of former employees. 
 Litigation legal expense 
 The increase of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to accruals recorded for the amount of the unsatisfied self insured retainer and legal defense costs related to the securities litigation lawsuit.

 Revenue 
 On February 5, 2024, the Company entered into a patent license agreement to develop cavrotolimod for potential treatment for hepatitis with a private clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Under the terms of the agreement, this biopharmaceutical company received an exclusive license in the field of hepatitis to all of the Company s relevant patents. 500 was paid to the Company after the execution of this agreement. 
 Research and development expense 
 The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the periods indicated:

Table of Contents 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Employee-related expense 511 (511) (100) Facilities, depreciation, and other expenses 755 (755) (100) Platform and discovery-related expense 93 (93) (100) Clinical development programs expense 64 (64) (100) Total research and development expense 1,423 (1,423) (100) 
 
 Research and development expense was 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of 1.4 million, or 100 from research and development expense of 1.4 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. In 2022, the Company suspended its clinical, preclinical, and discovery program activities and reduced headcount as it began exploring strategic alternatives in April 2023. As a result, after the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined it was no longer appropriate to record any research and development expenses. 
 General and administrative expense 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change General and administrative expense 4,005 11,155 (7,150) (64) Full time employees 6 6 
 
 General and administrative expense was 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an decrease of 7.2 million or 64 , from 11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher costs in 2023 from separation pay of former executives and related stock based compensation expense, payroll and related benefits, legal and consulting fees, facility and lease costs, depreciation from assets sold, and the research and development wind down costs that no longer met the criteria to be classified as research and development due to the shift in our historical operations suspending all research and development activities as previous discussed. 
 Litigation legal expense 
 The increase of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to accruals recorded for the amount of the unsatisfied self insured retainer and legal defense costs related to the securities litigation lawsuit. 
 Loss from sale of property and equipment 
 In the third quarter of 2023, the Company sold the majority of its scientific equipment through a third party auctioneer and incurred a loss on the sale of these assets as a result. 
 Other Income 
 The Company sold samples of its clinical products during the second quarter to a private clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. On September 27, 2024, the Company entered into and closed the sale of certain assets pursuant to the purchase agreement with the Purchaser. The assets sold to Purchaser include the Company s spherical nucleic acid-related technology, research and development programs, and clinical assets (the Acquired Assets to the Purchaser as described in the purchase agreement. The Company will receive gross proceeds of 1,500 from the sale of the Acquired Assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We generated limited revenue from our collaboration agreements, which have since been terminated. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds received from equity financings and payments received in connection with collaboration agreements, which have since been terminated. Currently we are exploring strategic alternatives and generating limited revenue. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 0.3 million as compared to 0.8 million as of December 31, 2023. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds received from equity financings and to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration agreements, the License Agreement and the Purchase Agreement. 
 We incurred net losses of approximately 2.5 million and 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. 
 The closing of the initial common stock purchase agreement for 1.3 million with HiTron executed on November 12, 2024 is expected to provide the Company with proceeds to fund operations into 2025. However, our current liquidity is not sufficient to continue to fund operations in the long term. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial additional financing will be needed in the very near term to fund our operations and there is no certainty we will obtain such financing. If we are unable to raise capital, we will be unable to continue operations. We may need to seek bankruptcy protection and/or cease operations in the near term, which may result in our stockholders receiving no or very little value in respect of their shares of our common stock. 
 The closing of the subsequent 8.7 million investment by HiTron is subject to receipt of stockholder approval, among other customary conditions. 
 See Funding Requirements below for additional information on our future capital needs. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 (unaudited) Net cash used in operating activities (2,065) (9,541) Net cash used in investing activities (1,789) Net cash provided by financing activities 1,000 3,675 Net (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (1,065) (7,655) 
 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 2.1 million and 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 7.4 million was due to the reduction of operating activities and lower headcount, and revenue received related to the patent license agreement and the sale of samples of clinical products and the purchase agreement for the Sold Assets.

Table of Contents 

Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.0 million and 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities of 1.8 million was primarily due to purchase of the convertible Notes Receivable in 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1.0 million and 3.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 2.7 million is due to the funds received from the Private Placement in February 2023. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We will need to obtain substantial additional funding in the very near term to continue operations. If we are unable to raise capital at all or on acceptable terms, we would be unable to continue operations. 
 Our existing cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including: 
 the results of our exploration of strategic alternatives, including any potential transactions; 
 the results of any future or pending litigation against the Company; 
 the extent to which we encounter increased costs as a result of global and macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and interest rates, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating exchange rates, and increases in commodity, energy and fuel prices; and 
 unknown legal, administrative, regulatory, accounting, and information technology costs as well as additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 The closing of the initial common stock purchase agreement for 1.3 million with HiTron executed on November 12, 2024 is expected to close in the near term and provide the Company with proceeds to fund operations into 2025. The closing of the subsequent 8.7 million investment by HiTron would provide additional liquidity and reduce our short-term funding needs. However, it is subject to receipt of stockholder approval, among other customary conditions, so we cannot provide assurance as to whether we will satisfy those conditions and close the investment, in a timely manner or at all. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through equity offerings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Further, the global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions over the past couple of years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and worsening global macroeconomic conditions, including actions taken by central banks to counter inflation, volatility in the capital markets and related market uncertainty, may impact our ability to obtain additional financing when needed on favorable terms or at all. Any further disruption or slowdown in the global financial markets and economy may negatively affect our ability to raise funding through equity or debt financings on attractive terms or at all, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. 
 Going Concern 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 205-40, Going Concern , we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are

Table of Contents 

issued. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, our continued viability is dependent on our ability to continue to raise additional capital to finance our operations. As discussed above, there are substantial uncertainties about our ability to raise such financing. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those described in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described below. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management identified material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the following: 
 1. The precision of management s review of the Statement of Operations, resulting in inappropriately classifying certain general and administrative expenses as research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 2. Management s review of the accounting treatment of non-routine activities. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

3. The Company failed to design and implement controls around all accounting and information technology processes and procedures. 
 These matters have been reviewed with our Audit Committee. 
 Remediation Plan 
 We are evaluating the material weakness and are developing a plan of remediation to strengthen the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control environment. The remediation plan will include enhancing our review procedures within our accounting department, implementing additional review procedures with respect to accumulation and evaluation of information that is known or knowable to the Company at the time, and applying that information to the applicable accounting guidance. Subject to our ability to obtain additional financing and the results of our review of strategic alternatives, we will also consider whether additional personnel are necessary. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 On December 13, 2021, Mark Colwell filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company, David A. Giljohann and Brian C. Bock in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, captioned Colwell v. Exicure, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-0663. On February 4, 2021, plaintiff filed an amended putative securities class action complaint. On March 20, 2023, the court entered an order appointing James Mathew as lead plaintiff and Bleichmar Fonti Auld LLP as lead counsel in the action pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. On May 26, 2023, lead plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against the Company, Dr. Giljohann, Mr. Bock, and Grant Corbett. The second amended complaint alleges that Dr. Giljohann, Mr. Bock, and Dr. Corbett made materially false and/or misleading statements related to the Company s clinical programs purportedly causing losses to investors who acquired Company securities between January 7, 2021 and December 10, 2021. The second amended complaint does not quantify any alleged damages but, in addition to attorneys fees and costs, lead plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of himself and others who acquired the Company s stock during the putative class period at allegedly inflated prices and purportedly suffered financial harm as a result. On October 8, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement in the securities class action and set a schedule for final approval proceedings, including a final approval hearing on January 13, 2025. 
 The proposed settlement described above will be fully covered by insurance. However, the settlement will include a reservation of rights by the insurers against the Company for the unsatisfied portion of its self insured retainer. As a result, the Company recorded an accrual as of September 30, 2024 for the amount of the unsatisfied retainer, approximately 1.14 million. The Company is currently negotiating with the insurers to attempt to settle for an amount less than the full retainer amount. On November 12, 2024, the Company successfully negotiated with one of the insurers that will result in a small gain in the fourth quarter. 
 The Company is currently negotiating with the insurers to settle for an amount that will be less than the full retainer amount. The Company will record a significant gain once this settlement with the insurers is executed. 
 On March 1, 2022, Kapil Puri filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, against Messrs. Giljohann and Bock, Jeffrey L. Cleland, Elizabeth Garofalo, Bosun Hau, Bali Muralidhar, Andrew Sassine, Matthias Schroff, James Sulat and Timothy Walbert, captioned Puri v. Giljohann, et al. , Case No. 1:22-cv-01083. On March 8, 2022, Yixin Sim filed a similar shareholder derivative lawsuit in the same court against the same individuals, captioned Sim v. Giljohann, et al. , Case No. 1:22-cv-01217. On April 25, 2022, Stourbridge Investments LLC filed a similar shareholder derivative lawsuit against the same individuals in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned Stourbridge Investments LLC v. Exicure, Inc. et al. , Case No. 1:22-cv-00526. Based on similar factual allegations presented in the Colwell complaint, described above, the Puri , Sim , and Stourbridge complaints, or collectively, the Derivative Complaints, allege that the defendants caused the Company to issue false and/or misleading statements in its 2021 proxy statement regarding risk oversight, code of conduct, clinical program and compensation matters, among other things, in violation of federal securities law, and committed breaches of fiduciary duties. The Derivative Complaints also assert that Dr. Giljohann and Mr. Bock are liable for contribution under the federal securities laws. The Puri and Stourbridge complaints further assert state law claims for unjust enrichment, and the Puri complaint additionally asserts state law claims for abuse of control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste. The plaintiffs do not quantify any alleged damages in the Derivative Complaints, but seek restitution for damages to the Company, attorneys fees, costs, and expenses, as well as an order directing that certain proposals for strengthening board oversight be put to a vote of the Company s shareholders. 
 On March 18, 2022, James McNabb, through counsel, sent a written demand to the Company (the Demand Letter demanding that the Board of Directors investigate certain allegations and commence proceedings on the Company s behalf against certain of the Company s current officers and directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and corporate waste. All of the Derivative Cases have been stayed pending a decision on any motion to dismiss that may be filed in the Colwell case. Further, pursuant to agreement, the Demand Letter is being held in abeyance and any related statute of limitations tolled pending such motion and decision.

On October 3, 2023, a former employee filed a complaint against the Company and its executives related to the former employee s separation from the Company. The parties proceeded with paper discovery and this matter did not settle at an in-person settlement conference on July 17, 2024. As a result, we are in the discovery phase of this litigation. 
 We may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following risks should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects and an investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our exploration of strategic alternatives may not be successful. 
 
 Given the Company s current focus to explore growth through strategic transactions with potential partners, the Company s ability to execute its current business plan depends on its ability to obtain additional funding via a strategic transaction or a series of strategic transactions, or to obtain funding to support such a transaction. We currently have no source of significant, ongoing revenues or committed financing, and our financial resources are limited to our cash and cash equivalents. Substantial additional funding is needed in the very near term. 
 The Company plans to continue pursuing strategic alternatives, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient resources or obtain additional financing necessary to complete this effort. Even if we can obtain financing, we may not be able to consummate such a transaction in a timely manner or at all or in a manner that would not adversely impact our business. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Strategic transactions are complex and time-consuming to identify, evaluate, negotiate and consummate in compliance with applicable laws and Nasdaq requirements. Our board and management do not have meaningful experience executing this type of endeavor in the U.S. public markets. Even if we are successful in entering into a strategic transaction, the terms and conditions of that transaction may restrict us from entering into future agreements with other potential collaborators. Additionally, such strategic transactions may not be favorable to investors nor deliver any anticipated benefits by the time of business integration. 
 We need to obtain substantial funding in the very near term in order to continue operations and our exploration of strategic alternatives. 
 
 We require significant capital resources in order to continue to operate our business and conduct our exploration of strategic alternatives, and our very limited liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Because we have no current source of significant, ongoing revenue or committed financing, our current available cash and cash equivalents provide us with very limited liquidity. Our existing cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient for us to continue to fund our business operations. Substantial additional funding is needed in the very near term. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, due to a variety of factors, including uncertainty about the future direction of the Company and investor reaction to our controlling stockholders and board and management composition, as well as broader conditions in the economy and capital markets, including recent volatility caused by inflation and other factors. The Company has already engaged in significant cost reductions, so our ability to further cut costs and extend our operating runway is limited. Without sufficient additional capital funding in the very near term, we may be required, among other things, to seek bankruptcy protection and/or cease operations. 
 The closing of the initial common stock purchase agreement for 1.3 million with HiTron executed on November 12, 2024 is expected to close in the near term and provide the Company with proceeds to fund operations into 2025. The closing of the subsequent 8.7 million investment by HiTron would provide additional liquidity and reduce our short-term funding needs. However, it is subject to receipt of stockholder approval, among other customary conditions, so we cannot provide assurance as to whether we will satisfy those conditions and close the investment, in a timely manner or at all. 
 It is uncertain if or when we will recognize any royalties or license payments arising from our historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets. 
 
 After we announced the wind down of our historical biotechnology activities in September 2022, we undertook an effort to generate value from our historical assets. This resulted in 2.6 million of revenues and other income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we licensed certain assets and then sold our historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets (including the licensed assets and licensing agreement) pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. However, following the Purchase Agreement, any additional value we may generate from our historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets will be primarily through royalties and license fees that we may receive in the future under the Purchase Agreement. Whether we receive any royalties or licenses fees, and the amounts and timing thereof, 
 39 

Table of Contents 

are uncertain and out of our control. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will ever generate additional revenue from this Purchase Agreement. 
 We do not expect to be able to redeem the investment in convertible Notes Receivable. 
 In March 2024, the Company notified the issuer of the investment in convertible Notes Receivable that it was exercising its redemption right with respect to the entire principal amount of the investment in convertible Notes Receivable after the first anniversary of their issue dates (May 3 and May 16, 2024, respectively) for an aggregate redemption price of 2.090 million (representing the principal amount plus 4.5 per annum yield to the redemption date). 
 In response, the issuer took the position that the investment in convertible Notes Receivable were not redeemable until August 3, 2024 and August 16, 2024. 
 We again attempted to redeem the entire principal amount of the convertible Notes Receivable in in May, but have not received a response to our most recent request. As a result, management does not believe the Notes Receivable are recoverable and they have been written down to 0 on our balance sheet. 
 Our controlling stockholders, executive officers and members of our board, have limited experience controlling or governing a public company operating in the United States. 
 Our controlling stockholders have not previously controlled a U.S. public company. In addition, no members of the board or our chief executive officer or chief financial officer have experience serving as directors or management of a U.S. publicly traded company. This could make it difficult to ensure that the Company complies with all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, maintains adequate internal and disclosure controls and appropriately assesses and manages risk. This concern is exacerbated by the limited resources the Company has following recent reductions in force, and if there are further reductions in force or members of management leave the Company, it may be very difficult to manage this risk. The transitional state of the Company and ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives also exacerbates the challenging environment in this respect. If the board of directors does not successfully or efficiently manage their roles and responsibilities, including the significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of investors, our prospects may be adversely impacted. In addition, against this backdrop, it may be difficult to earn the confidence of prospective investors or strategic partners, threatening our ability to obtain much needed financing and hindering our exploration of strategic alternatives. 
 Turnover of our board and senior management, and any inability to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could impair our ability to implement our business plan. 
 As we continue our exploration of strategic alternatives, and potentially pursue transactions involving new business lines or industries, we may experience additional turnover in our board and senior management. Departures of members of our senior management team and board members have created, and will create if they continue, significant continuity risks and challenges to our ability to operate our business, assess and manage risks and comply with applicable laws. If key members of our senior management team depart, it will be important that we attract and retain qualified managers promptly and develop and implement an effective succession plan. We expect to face significant competition in attracting experienced executives and other key personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, there are significant uncertainties as to how our transitional state of operations, financial condition and related matters will impact our ability to attract the necessary personnel and manage these succession risks. Our urgent need to raise capital and engage with potential partners in strategic transactions magnify these risks. If we are unable to adequately address these concerns in the near term, and earn the confidence of potential investors and/or business partners, our prospects and financial condition would be adversely impacted. 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. 
 Our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional funding. Based on our current operating plans and existing working capital at September 30, 2024, our current liquidity is not sufficient to continue to fund operations. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial additional financing will be needed by us in the very near term to fund our operations and exploration of strategic alternatives. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors and employees. Obtaining additional financing contains risks, including: 
 additional equity financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms and any equity we are able to issue could lead to dilution for current stockholders; 
 40 

Table of Contents 

loans or other debt instruments may have terms and/or conditions, such as interest rate, restrictive covenants and control or revocation provisions; 
 the current environment in capital markets combined with our capital constraints may prevent us from being able to obtain adequate debt financing; and 
 if we fail to obtain required additional financing to grow our business we may need to seek bankruptcy protection in the near term. 
 We currently do not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements and have received a delisting determination notice from the Nasdaq staff. Our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq which could negatively impact the price of our common stock, liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets. 
 Our common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol XCUR. As previously disclosed, the Company has received numerous deficiency notices with respect to various Nasdaq listing requirements in the past year and recently received a delisting determination from the Nasdaq staff. These related to, or may in the future relate to: 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price rule due to the Company s stock trading below 1.00 for a sustained period of time. The Company effected a one-for-thirty reverse stock split on June 29, 2022 in order to attempt to raise the stock price. On September 13, 2023, the Company received a delinquency notification that the closing bid price of the Company s stock traded below 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The Company effected a one-for-five reverse stock split on August 27, 2024 in order to attempt to raise the stock price. On September 13, 2024, the Company received a letter received from Nasdaq noting it met the closing bid price requirement. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s rule requiring stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 based on the Company s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company is not in compliance with this requirement based on its September 30, 2024 balance sheet. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s corporate governance requirements with respect to board and committee composition. The Company has received numerous deficiency notifications with respect to these requirements in the past year. Although the Company believes it is currently in compliance, there can be no assurance it will remain in compliance. 
 Compliance with Nasdaq s requirement to hold an annual meeting. On January 11, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it did not comply with listing requirements by not holding an annual meeting in 2023. The Company held its combined 2023 and 2024 annual meeting on June 28, 2024 
 On April 17, 2024, the Company received a delinquency notification as it had not filed its Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The extended deadline for compliance was established by Nasdaq at May 20, 2024, the same deadline for our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Annual Report Form 10-K was filed on June 6, 2024. 
 Although the Company filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 prior to the extended deadline of May 20, 2024, on May 21, 2024, the Company received a delisting determination from the Nasdaq staff as a result of not filing its Annual Report Form 10-K by the May 20, 2024 deadline and failure to timely file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (which was subsequently filed on June 17, 2024). The staff s delisting determination also noted the failure to hold its 2023 annual meeting as another basis of the delisting determination. 
 On May 28, 2024, the Company requested an appeal of the delisting determination to Nasdaq s Hearings Panel Panel ), and the hearing took place on July 9, 2024. On July 31, 2024, the Company received formal notice that the Panel determined to continue the Company s listing subject to the Company evidencing compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market by September 16, 2024. The Company received an additional extension to November 14, 2024 to satisfy the terms of the Panel s decision and to ensure the Company s continued listing on Nasdaq. 
 As the Company will not meet Nasdaq s listing requirements as of September 30, 2024, the Company has requested another extension by the Panel to demonstrate compliance. We cannot provide assurance that the Panel will determine to continue the Company s listing at the November 14, 2024 expiration of the current extension or that, if another extension is granted, that we will be able to meet the Panel s requirements by the deadline.

We may not be successful in our appeal or be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements and our failure to do so may result in the delisting of our Common Stock by Nasdaq. Even if the Company is successful in our appeal, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with Nasdaq s requirements and will not be delisted. 
 If Nasdaq suspends or delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant negative consequences including: 
 limited availability of market quotations and liquidity for our securities; 
 a determination that the common stock is a penny stock which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of common stock; 
 a limited amount of analyst coverage, if any; and 
 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
 Suspension or delisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and make obtaining new financing much more challenging. In addition, fewer strategic opportunities may be available, particularly from counterparties that are interested in combining with a listed company. 
 We have a history of losses. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock. 
 Between our inception in June 2011 and the Company s decision to engage in a broader exploration of strategic alternatives, we devoted our resources to the development of SNA technology, and are currently exploring out-licensing opportunities and strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. We have had significant operating losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we have generated an accumulated deficit of 210.9 million, including 18,837 of additional paid-in capital reclassed to accumulated deficit upon C-corporation conversion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 2.5 million and 15.4 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. 
 Although we have generated a limited amount of revenues from licensing and sales of supplies, we have not generated, and do not expect to generate, any product revenue for the foreseeable future and currently have no source of significant, ongoing revenue or committed financing, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of future losses is uncertain. Our future financial performance and condition are substantially dependent on the results of our ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful. 
 We are pursuing asset out-licenses, asset sales and similar strategic transactions with respect to our historical assets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing such a strategic transactions. 
 Our internal computer systems, or those of contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business operations. 
 Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruptions of our operations. For instance, theft or other exposure of data may interfere with our ability to protect our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other information critical to our operations. We can provide no assurances that certain sensitive and proprietary information relating to one or more of our therapeutic candidates has not been, or will not in the future e, compromised. Although we have invested resources to enhance the security of our computer systems, there can be no assurances we will not experience additional unauthorized intrusions into our computer systems, or those of our contractors and consultants, that we will successfully detect future unauthorized intrusions in a timely manner, or that future unauthorized intrusions will not result in material adverse effects on our financial condition, reputation, or business prospects. Payments related to the elimination of ransomware may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our therapeutic candidates could be delayed.

Our information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business. 
 Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, documents storage systems, backup systems, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause interruptions and delays in our operations. 
 Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or unauthorized or inappropriate use of or access to our information technology systems. 
 We are dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack or unauthorized access and use by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, patient groups, disgruntled current or former employees and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. 
 The pervasiveness of cybersecurity incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve. Although we are making significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and are exploring various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our employees, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, unauthorized or inappropriate access or use, natural disasters, pandemics (including COVID-19), terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss or compromise of preclinical data for our therapeutic candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts, as well as delays in the commercialization of our products, and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption, security breach or unauthorized or inappropriate use or access to our systems were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including but not limited to patient, employee or vendor information, we could incur notification obligations to affected individuals and government agencies, liability, including potential lawsuits from patients, collaborators, employees, stockholders or other third parties and liability under foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information, and the development and potential commercialization of our therapeutic candidates could be delayed. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such loss or damage. Any long-term disruption in our ability to access our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations, our business, results of operations and stock price. 
 Our current operations are concentrated in one location and any events affecting this location may have material adverse consequences. 
 Our current operations are located in our facilities situated in Chicago, Illinois. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize the facilities, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, or interruption of our business operations. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. If our facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Any business interruption may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. 
 If we continue to fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we 
 43 

Table of Contents 

remain a non-accelerated filer or an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
 During the evaluation and testing process, we identified material weaknesses as described under Part I, Item 4 of this Form 10-Q. If we fail to remediate that material weakness, or if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Further, we may in the future discover additional weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in additional material misstatement of our financial statements. Moreover, our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. Moreover, we are aware that the remote working arrangements implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic potentially present new areas of risk, and we continue to carefully monitor any impact to our internal controls and procedures. 
 Our limited resources and recent reductions in force, as well as the turnover in our board of directors and the potential for future management changes, present significant continuity risk and could impact our ability to remediate our material weaknesses and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future. 
 If we are unable to remedy our material weaknesses and assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 
 The restatement of our prior quarterly financial statements may affect stockholder and investor confidence in us or harm our reputation, and may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties, including increased costs and the increased possibility of legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, sanctions or investigations. 
 Management identified material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting and restated its 2023 first quarter and second quarter unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements via Form 10-Q/A s. As a result of the restatement, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with, or related to, such restatement. In addition, such restatement could subject us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including the increased possibility of legal proceedings and inquiries, sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our reputation, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting, or our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, or cause stockholders, investors, members and customers to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports or cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The influence of our significant stockholders could make our Common Stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 CBI USA and DGP collectively own approximately 47 of outstanding Common Stock as of September 30, 2024 and exercised significant influence over us. We previously had been a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Members of our board and management are directly affiliated with CBI USA and DGP and will be affiliated with HiTron after the closing of its investments. HiTron will be a significant investor after the closing of its initial investment of 1.3 million, which is expected to occur within 10 days after November 12, 2024 and will be the largest stockholder in the Company after the closing of its subsequent investment of 8.7 million, which is subject to stockholder approval, among other conditions. Investors may be hesitant to invest in the Company given the influence of CBI, DGP, and HiTron and potential influence of other significant investors if DGP s agreement to sell 612,000 shares to third parties is completed. In addition, should the interest or interests of our controlling stockholders differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. 
 Additionally, it is possible we could pursue strategic or financing transactions with our controlling stockholders or their affiliates. The interests of the controlling stockholders and other stockholders would diverge in this case, and the lack of an independent board to evaluate such a transaction could adversely impact other stockholders. These conflicts of interest (or the perception that they could occur) might adversely affect our business and prospects for obtaining financing or completing a strategic transaction. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

For so long as CBI USA, DGP, and HiTron own a significant stake, they (and/or their transferees) will have substantial control over the elections of our directors and to approve any other corporate action requiring the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. This could deter investment in the Company and adversely impact our stock price and ability to obtain financing. These impacts may be more pronounced in the near term as investors assess the direction of the Company under the control of HiTron, CBI USA, and DGP and the actions of the new board and management. This could deter investment as it creates uncertainty as to the transferees intentions with respect to the Company. 
 Potential partners considering engaging in a strategic transaction with the Company could have similar concerns. Given our urgent need for additional funding and/or to complete a strategic transaction, it is imperative that our controlling stockholders and our board and management earn the confidence of investors and potential partners in the near term and there is no assurance this will occur. 
 The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. 
 Our stock price will continue to be volatile. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the other risks described in this section titled Risk Factors and the following: 
 our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it; 
 the development, execution and announcement of any proposed strategic alternative; 
 investors may react negatively to our controlled company status and the influence of our controlling stockholder or our reconstituted board and/or our uncertain business strategy; 
 strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; 
 we are unable to achieve the perceived benefits of our Company as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts; and 
 changes in general economic, industry, political and market conditions, including, but not limited to, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market and industry factors, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel/Hamas war and retaliatory actions taken by the United States, NATO and others, may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. 
 Raising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we expect to attempt to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings. As discussed elsewhere, it may be very challenging to obtain equity or debt financing given the current transitional state of the Company. However, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of shares or other securities convertible into shares, our stockholders will be diluted. Future issuances of our common stock or other equity securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-linked securities. 
 We cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to us will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 We were an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act until December 31, 2023. As such, we took advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, 
 45 

Table of Contents 

as an emerging growth company, we were only required to provide two years of audited financial statements. Even though we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of 2024, we still qualify as a smaller reporting company and a non-accelerated filer which allows us to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. 
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders, and the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company, or the Board, to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15 of the outstanding combined organization voting stock from merging or combining with the combined organization. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then-current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any of the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claims for which a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery has exclusive jurisdiction or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
 This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. If a court were to find this exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in any action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

We have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to be profitable in the near future, if ever. Our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards generated in tax years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, are only permitted to be carried forward for 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as modified by the CARES Act, our federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is be limited to 80 of taxable income. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50 change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past. We completed a review of our changes in ownership through December 31, 2022 and determined that we experienced an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382(g) during the fourth quarter of 2022. This ownership change has and will continue to subject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which will significantly restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership change. 
 We determined that at the date of the 2022 ownership change, we had a net unrealized built-in loss NUBIL ). The NUBIL was determined based on the difference between the fair market value of our assets and their tax basis at the ownership change date. Because of the NUBIL, certain deductions recognized during the five-year period beginning on the date of the IRC Section 382 ownership change (the "recognition period") are subject to the same limitation as the net operating loss carryforwards or certain other deductions. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we determined that we ceased operations of our historical business enterprise which subjects us to a zero limitation as defined under IRC Section 382(c). Therefore, we are restricted in our ability to use any of the historical net operating losses that occurred before the most recent ownership change in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 General Risk Factors 
 FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock due to our low stock price. 
 The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities, which we believe they are, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common stock. 
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Our research coverage by securities and industry analysts is currently limited. In addition, because we did not become a reporting company by conducting an underwritten initial public offering of our common stock, security analysts of brokerage firms may not provide wider coverage of our Company. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we became a public reporting company by means of an underwritten initial public offering, because they may be less familiar with our Company as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media, and because we became public at an early stage in our development. The failure to receive wider research coverage or support in the market for our shares will have an adverse effect on our ability to develop a liquid market for our common stock and the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. 
 In the event we obtain wider securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our target studies and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

 (c) DGP shall have notified the Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished the Company with a detailed statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and, if requested by the Company, DGP shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the 
 4 

Company, that such disposition will not require registration under the Securities Act and will be in compliance with applicable state securities laws. 
 
 3.11 Legends . DGP understands that the certificates (or electronic equivalent) or notice or notices of issuance related to uncertificated securities representing the Acquired Shares will contain a legend set out in Exhibit B or one substantially similar thereto, and neither the Company nor its transfer agent or registrar is required to recognize any transfer of the Acquired Shares if, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, such transfer would result in a violation of any federal or state law regarding the offer and sale of securities. 
 3.12 Legal Proceedings . There are no legal proceedings pending or, to DGP s knowledge, threatened in writing, against or affecting DGP or DGP s respective assets, at law or in equity, by or before any governmental authority, or by or on behalf of any third party, which, if adversely determined, would impair DGP s ability to enter into this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
