 Legal Matters. We are party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. Based on management's present knowledge of the facts and (in certain cases) advice of outside counsel, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations after taking into account any existing reserves, which reserves are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, future events or circumstances that may currently be unknown to management will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

Forward-looking statements contained in this Report speak only as of the date of this Report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this Report or in any document incorporated herein by reference to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, except as required by law. 
 Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control. To the extent that our assumptions and expectations differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements may be significantly hindered. Factors that could affect our results and cause them to materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Form 10-K"). 
 Introduction 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. References to "Note" or "Notes" pertain to the Notes to our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Company Overview 
 Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, we design and produce factory-built homes primarily distributed through a network of independent and Company-owned retailers, planned community operators and residential developers. We are one of the largest producers of manufactured homes in the United States, based on reported wholesale shipments. Our products are marketed under a variety of brand names including Cavco, Fleetwood, Palm Harbor, Nationwide, Fairmont, Friendship, Chariot Eagle, Destiny, Commodore, Colony, Pennwest, R-Anell, Manorwood, MidCountry and Solitaire. We are also a leading producer of park model RVs, vacation cabins and factory-built commercial structures. Our finance subsidiary, CountryPlace Acceptance Corp. ("CountryPlace"), is an approved Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation seller/servicer, and a Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") mortgage-backed securities issuer that offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of factory-built homes. Our insurance subsidiary, Standard Casualty, provides property and casualty insurance primarily to owners of manufactured homes. 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 We operate a total of 31 homebuilding production lines with domestic locations in Millersburg and Woodburn, Oregon; Riverside, California; Nampa, Idaho; Phoenix, Glendale and Goodyear, Arizona; Deming, New Mexico; Duncan, Oklahoma; Austin, Fort Worth, Seguin and Waco, Texas; Montevideo, Minnesota; Dorchester, Wisconsin; Nappanee and Goshen, Indiana; Lafayette, Tennessee; Douglas and Moultrie, Georgia; Shippenville (two lines) and Emlenton, Pennsylvania; Martinsville and Rocky Mount, Virginia; Crouse and Hamlet, North Carolina; Ocala and Plant City, Florida; and two international lines in Ojinaga, Mexico. We distribute our homes through a large network of independent distribution points in 48 states and Canada and 79 Company-owned U.S. retail stores, of which 47 are located in Texas. 
 Company and Industry Outlook 
 According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, industry home shipments for the calendar year through August 2024 were 68,550, an increase of 16.8 compared to 58,698 shipments in the same calendar period last year. Higher interest rates and continued inflationary pressures have tempered industry demand. However, the manufactured h ousing industry offers solutions to the housing crisis with lower average price per square foot than a site-built home and the comparatively lower cost associated with manufactured home ownership, which remains competitive with rental housing. 
 The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, young adults and those who are age 55 and older, are both growing. " First-time" and "move-up" buyers of affordable homes are historically among the largest segments of new manufactured home purchasers. Included in this group are lower-income households that are particularly affected by periods of low employment rates and underemployment. Consumer confidence is especially important among manufactured home buyers interested in our products for seasonal or retirement living. 
 We employ a concerted effort to identify niche market opportunities where our diverse product lines and custom building capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage. We are focused on building quality, energy efficient homes for the modern home buyer. Our green building initiatives involve the creation of an energy efficient envelope, including higher utilization of renewable materials and provide lower utility costs. We also build homes designed to use alternative energy sources, such as solar. 
 We maintain a conservative cost structure in an effort to build added value into our homes and we work diligently to maintain a solid financial position. Our balance sheet strength, including the position in cash and cash equivalents, helps avoid liquidity problems and enables us to act effectively as market opportunities or challenges present themselves. 
 We continue to make certain commercial loan programs available to members of our wholesale distribution chain. Under direct commercial loan arrangements, we provide funds for financed home purchases by distributors, community operators and residential developers (see Note 7, Commercial Loans Receivable to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements). Our involvement in commercial lending helps to increase the availability of manufactured home financing to distributors, community operators and residential developers and provides additional opportunities for product exposure to potential home buyers. While these initiatives support our ongoing efforts to expand product distribution, they also expose us to risks associated with the creditworthiness of this customer base and our inventory financing partners. 
 The lack of an efficient secondary market for manufactured home-only loans and the limited number of institutions providing such loans results in higher borrowing costs for home-only loans and continues to constrain industry growth. We work independently and with other industry participants to develop secondary market opportunities for manufactured home-only loan and non-conforming mortgage portfolios and expand lending availability in the industry. We also develop and invest in home-only lending programs to grow sales of homes through traditional distribution points. We believe that growing our investment and participation in home-only lending may provide additional sales growth opportunities for our factory-built housing operations and reduce our customers' dependence on independent lenders for this source of financing.

 Key housing building materials include wood, wood products, steel, gypsum wallboard, windows, doors fiberglass insulation, carpet, vinyl, fasteners, plumbing materials, aluminum, appliances and electrical items . Fluctuations in the cost of materials and labor may affect gross margins from home sales to the extent that costs cannot be efficiently matched to the home sal es price. Pricing and availability of certain raw materials have been volatile due to a number of factors in the current environment. We continue to monitor and react to inflation in the cost of these materials by maintaining a focus on our product pricing in response to higher materials costs, but such product pricing increases may lag behind the escalation of such costs. From time to time and to varying degrees, we may experience shortages in the availability of materials and/or labor in the markets served. Availability of these inputs has not caused significant production halts in the current period, but we have experienced periodic shutdowns in other periods and shortages of primary building materials have caused production inefficiencies as we have needed to change processes in response to the delay in materials. These shortages may also result in extended order backlogs, delays in the delivery of homes and reduced gross margins from home sales. 
 Our backlog at September 28, 2024 was 276 million compared to 232 million at June 29, 2024, an increase of 44 million and up 106 million compared to 170 million at September 30, 2023. 
 While it is difficult to predict the future of housing demand, employee availability, supply chain and Company performance and operations, maintaining an appropriately sized and well-trained workforce is key to meeting demand. We continually review the wage rates of our production employees and have established other monetary incentive and benefit programs, with a goal of providing competitive compensation. We are also working to more extensively use web-based recruiting tools, update our recruitment brochures and improve the appearance and appeal of our manufacturing facilities to improve the recruitment and retention of qualified production employees and reduce annualized turnover rates.

The decrease in revenue per home sold was attributed to a lower proportion of homes sold through our Company-owned stores and, to a lesser extent, product pricing decreases. 
 Net factory-built housing revenue per home sold is a volatile metric dependent upon several factors. A primary factor is the price disparity between sales of homes to independent distributors, builders, communities and developers and sales of homes to consumers by Company-owned retail stores. Wholesale sales prices are primarily comprised of the home and the cost to ship the home from a homebuilding facility to the home-site. Retail home prices include these items and retail markup, as well as items that are largely subject to home buyer discretion, including, but not limited to, installation, utility connections, site improvements, landscaping and additional services. Our h omes are constructed in one or more floor sections ("modules") which are then installed on the customer's site. Changes in the number of modules per home, the selection of different home types/models and optional home upgrades create changes in product mix, also causing fluctuations in this metric. 
 For the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, Financial services Net revenue increased primarily due to higher insurance premiums.

 Income tax expense increased for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher profit before income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate due to an increase in energy star tax credits. Income tax expense for the six months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period decreased due to lower profit and a lower effective tax rate due to an increase in energy star tax credits. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We believe that cash and cash equivalents at September 28, 2024, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations, cover our obligations and provide for growth for the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. We maintain cash in U.S. Treasury and other money market funds, some of which is in excess of federally insured limits, but we have not experienced any losses with regards to such excesses. We expect to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of, or strategic investments in, businesses that are complementary to the Company, as well as other expansion opportunities. Such transactions may require the use of cash and have other impacts on our liquidity and capital resources. We believe we have sufficient liquid resources including our 50 million Revolving Credit Facility which may be increased from time to time through an additional Incremental Term Facility up to an aggregate amount of 100 million and no amounts are outstanding. Depending on our operating results and strategic opportunities, we may choose to seek additional or alternative sources of financing in the future. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. If this financing were not available, it could be necessary for us to reevaluate our long-term operating plans to make more efficient use of our existing capital resources at such time. The exact nature of any changes to our plans that would be considered depends on various factors, such as conditions in the factory-built housing industry and general economic conditions outside of our control. 
 State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, the assets owned by our insurance subsidiary are generally not available to satisfy the claims of Cavco or its other subsidiaries. We believe that stockholders' equity at the insurance subsidiary remains sufficient and do not believe that the ability to pay ordinary dividends to Cavco at anticipated levels will be restricted per state regulations. 
 The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively: 
 Six Months Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of the fiscal year 368,753 283,490 85,263 Net cash provided by operating activities 102,074 160,200 (58,126) Net cash used in by investing activities (11,029) (6,421) (4,608) Net cash used in financing activities (73,581) (42,240) (31,341) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of the period 386,217 395,029 (8,812) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily from increases in working capital, primarily 20.5 million in Inventory and 17.4 million from Accounts receivable, and the spread between Consumer loans originated versus sold and Commercial loans originated versus principal payments received on commercial loans. This was partially offset by changes in Accounts payable and accrued expenses due primarily to increased customer deposits and volume rebates due to customers. 
 Consumer loan originations decreased 16.3 million to 39.9 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 from 56.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, and proceeds from sales of consumer loans decreased 34.2 million to 30.9 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 from 65.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Commercial loan originations increased 2.9 million to 54.7 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 from 51.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Proceeds from the collection on commercial loans provided 55.1 million this year, compared to 59.4 million in the prior year, a net decrease of 4.3 million. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash for investing activities consists of buying and selling debt and marketable equity securities in our Financial Services segment; purchases of property, plant and equipment; and funding strategic growth acquisitions in our Factory-built Housing segment. The change in cash used in the current period is primarily due to the prior year period including proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment that did not repeat in the current year. 
 The change in Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to the repurchase of the more shares of common stock and at a higher average daily stock price.
