allowance related to the available for sale debt securities portfolio. 
 
 Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts. Premiums on debt securities are amortized to the initial call date, if applicable, or to the maturity date, on the level-yield method. Discounts on debt securities are accreted to the maturity date on the level-yield method. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted based on anticipated prepayments on the level-yield method. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis FHLBI stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. 
 
 million and million at September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Interest income on commercial loans and mortgage loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer and credit card loans are typically charged off no later than when they are days past due. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal and interest is considered doubtful. 
 
 Accrued interest is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 

million and million, respectively. 
 
 Mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price, which includes a gain or loss on the interest rate commitment coverage position, and the carrying value of the related loan sold, which is reduced by the cost allocated to the servicing right. Market rate risk on interest rate commitments with borrowers prior to loan closing is mitigated through forward commitments referred to as to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage banking activities are not designated as hedges and are carried at fair value. The net gain or loss on mortgage banking derivatives, which is generally nominal in dollar amount, is included in the gain on sale of loans and recorded as part of mortgage banking income. 

Our qualitative factors include: 
 o Changes in lending policies and procedures 
 o Changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and in the terms of loans 
 o Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff 
 o Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans and adversely classified loans 
 o Changes in the quality of the loan review program 
 o Changes in the value of underlying collateral dependent loans 
 o Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and any changes in such 
 o Effect of other factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements 
 o Local or regional conditions that depart from the conditions and forecasts for the entire country 
 The estimation of future credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio at each evaluation date. While our methodology considers both the historical loss rates as well as the traditional qualitative factors, there may be instances or situations where additional qualitative factors need to be considered. Effective January 1, 2022, we established a historical loss information factor to address the relatively low level of loan losses during the look-back period. 
 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of million during the first nine months of 2024 . The provision for credit losses primarily reflected an individual allocation for a nonperforming commercial loan relationship, allocations necessitated by net loan growth, a change in the volume and severity of past due loans, nonaccrual loans and adversely classified loans for commercial and industrial loans and a change in the historical loss information qualitative factor for commercial loans, which more than offset the impacts of an improved economic forecast and changes to the loan portfolio composition. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable on loans totaling million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We elected not to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead elected to reverse interest income on loans that are placed on nonaccrual status, which is generally when loans become 90 days past due, or earlier if we believe the collection of interest is doubtful. We believe this policy results in the timely reversal of uncollectable interest. Identified problem loans, which exhibit characteristics (financial or otherwise) that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future, are included on an internal watch list. Senior management and the Board of Directors review this list regularly. In some cases, we may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate the loan from other loans within the loan segments. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific reserve allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed and collateral deficiencies, among other things. 

For individually analyzed loans which are deemed to be collateral dependent loans, we adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance based on the fair value of collateral. The allowance is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan s collateral and the recorded principal balance. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the recorded principal balance, no allowance is required. Fair value estimates of collateral on individually analyzed loans, as well as on foreclosed and repossessed assets, are reviewed periodically. We also have a process in place to monitor whether value estimates at each quarter-end are reflective of current market conditions. Our credit policies establish criteria for obtaining appraisals and determining internal value estimates. We may also adjust outside and internal valuations based on identifiable trends within our markets, such as recent sales of similar properties or assets, listing prices and offers received. In addition, we may discount certain appraised and internal value estimates to address distressed market conditions. 
 
 We are also required to consider expected credit losses associated with loan commitments over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk on the underlying commitments unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us. Any allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is reported as an other liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is increased or decreased via other noninterest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The calculation includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and forecasted credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives. The allowance is calculated using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to be funded. 
 
 billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Mortgage loan servicing rights are recognized as assets based on the allocated value of retained servicing rights on mortgage loans sold. Mortgage loan servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and are expensed in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights using groupings of the underlying mortgage loans as to interest rates. Any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance. 
 
 Servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing mortgage loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. Amortization of mortgage loan servicing rights is netted against mortgage loan servicing income and recorded in mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table depicts our sources of noninterest income presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income that are scoped within Topic 606: 

Credit and debit card income 
 Payroll services income 
 Customer service fees 

Service Charges on Deposit and Sweep Accounts: We earn fees from deposit and sweep customers for account maintenance, transaction-based and overdraft services. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of the month reflecting the period over which we satisfy the performance obligation. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as stop payment and returned item charges, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time we fulfill the customer request. Service charges on deposit and sweep accounts are withdrawn from the customer account balance. 
 
 Credit and Debit Card Income: We earn interchange income on our cardholder debit and credit card usage. Interchange income is primarily comprised of fees whenever our debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as Visa. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. 
 
 Payroll Services Income: We earn fees from providing payroll processing services for our commercial clients. Fees are assessed for processing weekly or bi-weekly payroll files, reports and documents, as well as year-end tax-related files, reports and documents. Fees are recognized and collected as payroll processing services are completed for each payroll run and year-end processing activities. 
 
 Customer Service Fees: We earn fees by providing a variety of other services to our customers, such as wire transfers, check ordering, sales of cashier checks and money orders, and rentals of safe deposit boxes. Generally, fees are recognized and collected daily, concurrently with the point in time we fulfill the customer request. Safe deposit box rentals are on annual contracts, with fees generally earned at the time of the contract signing or renewal. Customer service fees are recorded as other noninterest income on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, are as follows: 

Mortgage-backed securities 
 Municipal general obligation bonds 
 Municipal revenue bonds 
 Other investments 

Mortgage-backed securities 
 Municipal general obligation bonds

 Other investments 

We evaluate securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly. Consideration is given to the financial condition of the issuer and the intent and ability we have to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. For those debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost basis, we also consider our intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery and if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , debt securities with estimated fair values totaling million had unrealized losses aggregating million. At December 31, 2023 , debt securities with estimated fair values totaling million had unrealized losses aggregating million. At September 30, 2024 , unrealized losses aggregating million were attributable to bonds issued or guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. Federal Government, while unrealized losses totaling million were associated with bonds issued by state-based municipalities. For available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the debt security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income with the establishment of an allowance. For debt securities available for sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether any decline in fair value is due to credit loss factors. In making this assessment, we consider any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of the security, among other factors. 

The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2024 , by maturity, are shown in the following table. The contractual maturity is utilized for U.S. Government agency debt obligations and municipal bonds. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, are shown separately.

Total securities of any other specific issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies and the State of Michigan and all its political subdivisions, did not exceed 10 of shareholders equity. 
 
 The carrying value of U.S. Government agency debt obligation securities that are pledged to secure repurchase agreements was million and million at September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 

million as of December 31, 2023 . We also changed the segmentation of home equity lines of credit from 1 - 4 family mortgage loans to other consumer loans during the year ended December 31, 2023 . Home equity lines of credit share many of the same risk characteristics of both segments, however, losses are primarily driven by a lack of underlying collateral value during distressed situations as many of the loans are in a second lien position, and thus, best segmented within the other consumer portfolio. Home equity lines of credit totaled million as of December 31, 2023 . 

Our total loans at September 30, 2024 were billion compared to billion at December 31, 2023 , an increase of million, or .

Credit Quality Indicators. We utilize a comprehensive grading system for our commercial loans. All commercial loans are graded on a ten grade rating system. The rating system utilizes standardized grade paradigms that analyze several critical factors such as cash flow, operating performance, financial condition, collateral, industry condition and management. All commercial loans are graded at inception and reviewed and, if appropriate, re-graded at various intervals thereafter. The primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower, sufficiency of collateral, and timeliness of scheduled payments. We have a policy of requesting and reviewing periodic financial statements from commercial loan customers and employ a disciplined and formalized review of the existence of collateral and its value. All commercial loans are graded using the following criteria: 
 
 Grade 1. Exceptional Loans with this rating contain very little, if any, risk. 
 
 Grade 2. Outstanding Loans with this rating have excellent and stable sources of repayment and conform to bank policy and regulatory requirements. 
 
 Grade 3. Very Good Loans with this rating have strong sources of repayment and conform to bank policy and regulatory requirements. These are loans for which repayment risks are acceptable. 
 
 Grade 4. Good Loans with this rating have solid sources of repayment and conform to bank policy and regulatory requirements. These are loans for which repayment risks are modest. 
 
 Grade 5. Acceptable Loans with this rating exhibit acceptable sources of repayment and conform with most bank policies and all regulatory requirements. These are for loans for which repayment risks are satisfactory. 
 
 Grade 6. Monitor Loans with this rating are considered to have emerging weaknesses which may include negative current cash flow, high leverage, or operating losses. Generally, if further deterioration is observed, these credits will be downgraded to the criticized asset report. 
 
 Grade 7. Special Mention Loans with this rating have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan at some future date. 
 
 Grade 8. Substandard Loans with this rate are inadequately protected by current sound net worth, paying capacity of the obligor, or of the pledged collateral, if any. A Substandard loan normally has one or more well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Grade 9. Doubtful Loans with this rating exhibit all the weaknesses inherent in the Substandard classification and where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Grade 10. Loss Loans with this rating are considered uncollectable, and of such little value that continuance as an active asset is not warranted. 

The primary risk element with respect to each residential real estate loan and consumer loan is the timeliness of scheduled payments. We have a reporting system that monitors past due loans and have adopted policies to pursue creditors rights in order to preserve our collateral position. Retail loans that reach 90 days or more past due are generally placed into nonaccrual status and are categorized as nonperforming.

There were lines of credit with principal balances of million as of December 31, 2022 that were converted to term loans during 2023. 

We use a migration to loss methodology to determine historical loss rates for commercial loans given the comprehensive loan grading process employed by our bank for over two decades, while an open pool approach is best suited for retail loans given the smaller dollar size of the segments. A baseline loss rate is produced at each reporting date for each loan portfolio segment using bank-specific loan charge-off and recovery data over a defined historical look-back period. The look-back period represents the number of data periods that will be used to calculate a baseline loss rate for each loan portfolio segment. We determined that the look-back period commencing on January 1, 2011 through the current reporting date was reasonable and appropriate, which was used in the calculation of both the September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Our historical loss rate is then applied to future loan balances at the instrument level based on remaining contractual life adjusted for amortization, prepayment and default to develop a baseline lifetime loss. Our prepayment speed assumptions are developed at the loan segment level based upon the consideration of all relevant data which we believe could impact anticipated customer behavior, including changes in interest rates, economic conditions, and underlying property valuations. For the commercial portfolio segments, we assumed a prepayment speed as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as we deemed there to be no considerable changes from historical experience. For the retail 1 - 4 family mortgage and retail other consumer portfolios, we used a prepayment speed of as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 During each reporting period, we also consider the need to adjust the historical loss rates as determined to reflect the extent to which we expect current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which the historical loss information was determined. These qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease our estimate of expected future credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we used a one -year reasonable and supportable economic forecast period, with a six -month straight-line reversion period for all loan segments. The economic forecasts used for our September 30, 2024 allowance calculation reflected a million allowance balance reduction. The forecasts used for our December 31, 2023 allowance calculation reflected a million allowance balance reduction. 
 
 Individual loans exhibiting unique risk characteristics, which differentiated the loans from other loans within the loan segments and were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis, totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Individual allowance allocations totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

 We enter into facility leases in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024 , we were under lease contracts for eleven of our banking facilities. The leases have maturity dates ranging from February, 2025 through May, 2048, with a weighted average life of years as of September 30, 2024 . All of our leases have multiple three - to five -year extensions; however, these were not factored in the lease maturities and weighted average lease term as it was not reasonably certain we would exercise the options on the dates we entered into the lease agreements. 
 
 Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases at the lease commencement date, with all of our current leases determined to be operating leases. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date at the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate, on a collateralized basis, at lease commencement to calculate the present value of lease payments. The weighted average discount rate for leases was as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The right-of-use assets, included in premises and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the lease liabilities, included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. As permitted by applicable accounting standards, we have elected not to recognize short-term leases with original terms of twelve months or less on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total operating lease expense associated with the leases aggregated million during the third quarter of 2024 and million during the third quarter 2023 , respectively, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

Repurchase agreements have maturities of one business day. Repurchase agreements are treated as financings, and the obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Repurchase agreements are secured by U.S. Government agency securities with an aggregate fair value equal to the aggregate outstanding balance of the repurchase agreements. The securities, which are included in securities available for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are held in safekeeping by a correspondent bank.

Each advance is payable at its maturity date, and is subject to a prepayment fee if paid prior to the maturity date. The advances are collateralized by residential mortgage loans, first mortgage liens on multi-family residential property loans, first mortgage liens on commercial real estate property loans, and substantially all other assets of our bank under a blanket lien arrangement. Our borrowing line of credit as of September 30, 2024 totaled billion, with remaining availability based on collateral of million. 

For commercial lines of credit, retail lines of credit and credit card average outstanding balances, we determined allowance requirements by calculating the difference between the average percent outstanding of the funded commitments over the past several years to actual percent outstanding at the end of the period and applying the respective expected loss allocation factors to the difference as this difference represents the average of unfunded commitments we expect to eventually be drawn upon. For commitments to make loans, we determine an allowance by applying the expected loss allocation factor to the amount expected to be funded. The calculated allowance aggregated million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. We do not reserve for residential mortgage construction loans, as the loans are for one year or less and draws are governed by the receipt and satisfactory review of contractor and subcontractor sworn statements, lien waivers and title insurance company endorsements. Letters of credit are rarely drawn. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , the rates on existing off-balance sheet instruments were substantially equivalent to current market rates, considering the underlying credit standing of the counterparties.

 2 It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLBI stock due to transferability restrictions; therefore, fair value is estimated at carrying amount. 

Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, FHLBI stock, accrued interest receivable and payable, noninterest-bearing checking accounts and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Security fair values are based on market prices or dealer quotes, and if no such information is available, on the rate and term of the security and information about the issuer. Fair value for loans is based on an exit price model as required by ASU 2016 - 01, taking into account inputs such as discounted cash flows, probability of default and loss given default assumptions. The fair value for deposit accounts other than noninterest-bearing checking accounts is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market conditions. The fair values of subordinated debentures, subordinated notes, and FHLBI advances are based on current rates for similar financing. The fair values of interest rate swaps are based on discounted cash flows using forecasted yield curves, along with insignificant unobservable inputs, such as borrower credit spreads. The fair value of other off-balance sheet items is estimated to be nominal.

such impairment as of September 30, 2024 , or December 31, 2023 . We have Level 1 securities available for sale. 
 
 Derivatives . We measure fair value utilizing models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as forecasted yield curves. Insignificant unobservable inputs, such as borrower credit spreads, are also utilized. 

Mortgage loans held for sale . Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors, and are measured on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based on independent quoted market prices, where applicable, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we determined the fair value of our mortgage loans held for sale to be million and million, respectively. 
 
 Loans . We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral dependent loans to reflect partial write-downs or specific reserves that are based on the observable market price or current estimated value of the collateral. These loans are reported in the nonrecurring table below at initial recognition of significant borrower distress and on an ongoing basis until recovery or charge-off. The fair values of distressed loans are determined using either the sales comparison approach or income approach; respective unobservable inputs for the approaches consist of adjustments for differences between comparable sales and the utilization of appropriate capitalization rates. 
 
 Foreclosed Assets. At time of foreclosure or repossession, foreclosed and repossessed assets are adjusted to fair value less costs to sell upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed and repossessed assets, establishing a new cost basis. We subsequently adjust estimated fair value of foreclosed assets on a nonrecurring basis to reflect write-downs based on revised fair value estimates. The fair values of parcels of other real estate owned are determined using either the sales comparison approach or income approach; respective unobservable inputs for the approaches consist of adjustments for differences between comparable sales and the utilization of appropriate capitalization rates.

The carrying values are based on the estimated value of the property or other assets. Fair value estimates of collateral on nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets are reviewed periodically. Our credit policies establish criteria for obtaining appraisals and determining internal value estimates. We may also adjust outside appraisals and internal evaluations based on identifiable trends within our markets, such as sales of similar properties or assets, listing prices and offers received. In addition, we may discount certain appraised and internal value estimates to address current distressed market conditions. We generally assign a discount factor range of to for commercial real estate dependent loans and foreclosed assets, and a discount factor range of to for residential-related properties. In a vast majority of cases, we assign a discount factor for estimated selling costs.

Our consolidated capital levels as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include million and million, respectively, of trust preferred securities. Under applicable Federal Reserve guidelines, the trust preferred securities constitute a restricted core capital element. The guidelines provide that the aggregate amount of restricted core elements that may be included in our Tier 1 capital must not exceed of the sum of all core capital elements, including restricted core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. Our ability to include the trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital in accordance with the guidelines is not affected by the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act generally restricting such treatment, because (i) the trust preferred securities were issued before May 19, 2010, and (ii) our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 were less than billion. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , all million and million, respectively, of the trust preferred securities were included in our consolidated Tier 1 capital. 
 
 Under the final BASEL III capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, there is a requirement for a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not meet this required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in cash dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement was phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The capital buffer requirement raised the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to , the Tier 1 capital ratio to and the total capital ratio to on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. We believe that, as of September 30, 2024 , our bank meets all capital adequacy requirements under the BASEL III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis. 
 
 Our and our bank s ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices. On January 11, 2024 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of per share that was paid on March 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2024 . On April 11, 2024 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of per share that was paid on June 19, 2024 , to shareholders of record as of June 7, 2024 . On , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of per share that was paid on , to shareholders of record as of . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had the ability to repurchase up to million in common stock shares from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or by other means in accordance with applicable regulations as part of a million common stock repurchase program announced in May 2021. shares were repurchased during the first nine months of 2024 . Historically, stock repurchases have been funded from cash dividends paid to us from our bank. Additional repurchases may be made in future periods under the authorized plan or a new plan, which would also likely be funded from cash dividends paid to us from our bank. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased will be determined by us in our discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the stock price, capital position, financial performance, general market and economic conditions, alternative uses of capital and applicable legal requirements.

 Introduction 
 The following discussion compares the financial condition of Mercantile Bank Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mercantile Community Partners, LLC ("MCP") and Mercantile Bank our bank and its subsidiaries, including Mercantile Insurance Center, Inc. at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in this report. Unless the text clearly suggests otherwise, references in this report to us, we, our or the company include Mercantile Bank Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries referred to above. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP are complex and require us to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. We must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurements are not possible or practical. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements included in this report. For a discussion of our significant accounting estimates, see Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (Commission file number 000-26719). Our critical accounting policies are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements, and actual results may differ from those estimates. We have reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Allowance for Credit Losses a llowance : The allowance is maintained at a level we believe is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses identified and expected in the loan portfolio. Our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on historical credit loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, guidance from bank regulatory agencies, and assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the loan portfolio. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in our judgment, should be charged-off. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectability of a loan is likely. The balance of the allowance represents our best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality or economic conditions could result in a requirement for an increased allowance in the future. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality or improved economic conditions may result in a decline in the required allowance in the future. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on the allowance and operating results. The allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense. Uncollectable loans are charged-off through the allowance, while recoveries of loans previously charged-off are added to the allowance. 
 
 See Note 1- Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance. See also Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our loan portfolio and allowance. 
 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights : Mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets based on the allocated fair value of retained servicing rights on loans sold. Servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and are expensed in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. We utilize a discounted cash flow model to determine the value of our servicing rights. The valuation model utilizes mortgage loan prepayment speeds, the remaining life of the mortgage loan pool, delinquency rates, our cost to service loans, and other factors to determine the cash flow that we will receive from servicing each grouping of loans. These cash flows are then discounted based on current interest rate assumptions to arrive at the fair value of the right to service those loans. Impairment is evaluated quarterly based on the fair value of the servicing rights, using groupings of the underlying loans classified by interest rates. Any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance. 
 
 Goodwill : Accounting rules require us to determine the fair value of all the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity, and to record their fair value on the date of acquisition. We employ a variety of means in determining fair value, including the use of discounted cash flow analysis, market comparisons and projected future revenue streams. For those items for which we conclude that we have the appropriate expertise to determine fair value, we may choose to use our own calculation of fair value. In other cases, where the fair value is not readily determined, consultation with outside parties is used to determine fair value. Once valuations have been determined, the net difference between the price paid for the acquired entity and the fair value of the balance sheet is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment, with any such impairment recognized in the period identified. A more frequent assessment is performed if there are material changes in the market place or within the organizational structure.

Financial Overview 
 We reported net income of 19.6 million, or 1.22 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net income of 20.9 million, or 1.30 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2023. Net income during the first nine months of 2024 totaled 60.0 million, or 3.72 per diluted share, compared to 62.2 million, or 3.89 per diluted share, during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 While noninterest income increased during both periods, net income was negatively impacted by expected lower net interest income and increased noninterest expenses. Provision expense was lower during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023, and was the same during the first nine months of 2024 as it was during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Commercial loans increased 233 million during the first nine months of 2024, providing for an annualized growth rate of about 9 . Multi-family and residential rental property loans increased 93.8 million, in large part reflecting draws on multi-family construction loans, while non-owner occupied commercial real estate CRE loans grew 60.3 million, commercial and industrial loans increased 58.2 million and owner occupied CRE loans were up 29.0 million. As a percent of total commercial loans, commercial and industrial loans and owner occupied CRE loans combined equaled 56.5 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 57.7 at December 31, 2023. The commercial loan pipeline remains strong, and as of September 30, 2024, we had 241 million in unfunded loan commitments on commercial construction and development loans that are in the construction phase. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans increased 6.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, representing an annualized growth rate of about 1 . Residential mortgage loan originations totaled 364 million during the first nine months of 2024, of which almost 77 were originated with the intent to sell. 
 
 The overall quality of our loan portfolio remains strong, with nonperforming loans equaling 0.22 of total loans as of September 30, 2024. Accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days remain very low, and we had no foreclosed properties at quarter end. Gross loan charge-offs totaled less than 0.1 million during the first nine months of 2024, while recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs aggregated 0.8 million. 
 
 We recorded a provision expense of 1.1 million and 5.9 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The third quarter 2024 provision expense primarily reflects an increase in environmental factor allocations associated with the commercial and industrial loan segment and allocations necessitated by net loan growth, which were partially mitigated by decreases in the calculated allowance due primarily from the payoffs of two larger accruing problem commercial lending relationships. The provision expense during the first nine months of 2024 also includes specific allocations for two nonperforming non-real-estate-related commercial loan relationships that were established during the first and second quarters, along with allocations necessitated by net loan growth.

Interest-earning deposits, a vast majority of which is comprised of funds on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, averaged 206 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 102 million during the first nine months of 2023. The higher average balance primarily reflects an increase in deposits and our desire to maintain higher levels of on balance sheet liquidity. 
 
 Total deposits increased 555 million during the first nine months of 2024, providing for an annualized growth rate of about 19 . Growth in money market deposit accounts and local time deposits more than offset a reduction in business noninterest-bearing checking accounts primarily reflecting the customary level of customers tax and bonus payments and partnership distributions during the early part of each first quarter. Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis FHLBI advances declined 50.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. Wholesale funds, comprised of out-of-area deposits and FHLBI advances, totaled 540 million, or about 11 of total funds, as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net interest income declined 0.7 million and 2.2 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior-year time periods, reflecting the net impact of 12.2 million and 41.4 million increases in interest income and 12.9 million and 43.6 million increases in interest expense, during the respective periods. Our net interest margin declined 46 basis points and 48 basis points during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior-year time periods. Although our yield on earning assets increased 30 basis points and 47 basis points, respectively, during those time periods, our cost of funds was up 76 basis points and 95 basis points, respectively. While we experienced rapid growth in our earning asset yield during the period of March of 2022 through July of 2023 when the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC raised the targeted federal funds rate by 525 basis points, meaningful increases in our cost of funds did not begin to materialize until the latter part of 2022 when competition for deposit balances increased deposit rates, and depositors began to move funds from no- and lower-costing deposit types to higher-costing deposit products. Our net interest margin peaked during the latter part of 2022 and early stages of 2023. 
 
 Noninterest income totaled 9.7 million and 30.2 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 9.2 million and 23.8 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The higher level of noninterest income during both time periods primarily stemmed from increases in service charges on deposit accounts, primarily reflecting growth in treasury management fees, and mortgage banking income. Growth in payroll service income and revenue associated with a private equity investment also benefited noninterest income during both time periods, and benefit claims on bank owned life insurance policies were recorded during the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Noninterest expense totaled 32.3 million and 92.0 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 28.9 million and 85.3 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The higher level of noninterest expense primarily resulted from increased compensation and benefit costs along with higher data processing expenses. Contributions to The Mercantile Bank Foundation ("Foundation") totaled 0.7 million during the first quarter of 2024 and 0.4 million during the third quarter of 2023.

Financial Condition 
 Our total assets increased 564 million during the first nine months of 2024, and totaled 5.92 billion as of September 30, 2024. Total loans increased 249 million, interest-earning deposits were up 181 million and securities available for sale grew 86.3 million. Total deposits increased 555 million, while FHLBI advances decreased 50.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Commercial loans increased 233 million during the first nine months of 2024, providing for an annualized growth rate of about 9 . Multi-family and residential rental property loans increased 93.8 million, in large part reflecting draws on multi-family construction loans, while non-owner occupied CRE loans grew 60.3 million, commercial and industrial loans increased 58.2 million and owner occupied CRE loans were up 29.0 million. As a percent of total commercial loans, commercial and industrial loans and owner occupied CRE loans combined equaled 56.5 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 57.7 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 241 million in unfunded loan commitments on commercial construction and development loans that are in the construction phase, which we expect to be drawn over the next 12 to 18 months. Our current pipeline reports indicate continued strong commercial loan funding opportunities in future periods, including approximately 236 million in new lending commitments, a majority of which we expect to be accepted and funded over the next 12 to 18 months. Our commercial bankers also report ongoing additional opportunities they are currently discussing with existing and potentially new borrowers. We remain committed to prudent underwriting standards that provide for an appropriate yield and risk relationship, as well as concentration limits we have established within our commercial loan portfolio. Usage of existing commercial lines of credit averaged about 42 during the first nine months of 2024, compared to approximately 40 during all of 2023. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans increased 6.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, representing an annualized growth rate of about 1 . Residential mortgage loan originations totaled 364 million during the first nine months of 2024, of which almost 77 were originated with the intent to sell. Residential mortgage loan originations totaled 298 million during the first nine months of 2023, of which about 49 were originated with the intent to sell. In mid-2023, we altered our residential mortgage loan pricing strategy to encourage borrowers to select fixed rate residential mortgage loan products that we could sell rather than selecting adjustable rate residential mortgage loan products that we had to fund on our balance sheet. The strategy not only provided for less residential mortgage loans being funded on our balance sheet, but also resulted in higher mortgage banking income. 
 
 Other consumer-related loans totaled 60.6 million, or 1.3 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 51.1 million, or 1.1 of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. We expect this loan portfolio segment to remain relatively stable in dollar amount but decline as a percentage of total loans in future periods as the commercial loan segment grows.

Our credit policies establish guidelines to manage credit risk and asset quality. These guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to provide effective loan portfolio administration. The credit policies and procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending. In following these policies and procedures, we must rely on estimates, appraisals and evaluations of loans and the possibility that changes in these could occur quickly because of changing economic conditions or other factors. Identified problem loans, which exhibit characteristics (financial or otherwise) that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require modification in the future, are included on an internal watch list. Senior management and the Board of Directors review this list regularly. Market value estimates of collateral on nonperforming loans, as well as on foreclosed and repossessed assets, are reviewed periodically. We also have a process in place to monitor whether value estimates at each quarter-end are reflective of current market conditions. Our credit policies establish criteria for obtaining appraisals and determining internal value estimates. We may also adjust outside and internal valuations based on identifiable trends within our markets, such as recent sales of similar properties or assets, listing prices and offers received. In addition, we may discount certain appraised and internal value estimates to address distressed market conditions. 
 
 Nonperforming loans totaled 9.9 million, or 0.2 of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million, or 0.1 of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets, comprised of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest and foreclosed properties, totaled 9.9 million (0.2 of total assets) as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 million (0.1 of total assets) as of December 31, 2023. The volume of nonperforming assets has remained under 0.3 of total assets since year-end 2015. Given the low levels of nonperforming loans and accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent, combined with what we believe are strong credit administration practices, we are pleased with the overall quality of the loan portfolio. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, loan charge-offs totaled less than 0.1 million, while recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs equaled 0.8 million. We continue our collection efforts on charged-off loans and expect to record recoveries in future periods; however, given the nature of these efforts, it is not practical to forecast the dollar amount and timing of the recoveries. 
 
 The primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower, the sufficiency of collateral, and timeliness of scheduled payments. We have a policy of requesting and reviewing periodic financial statements from commercial loan customers, and we have a disciplined and formalized review of the existence of collateral and its value. The primary risk element with respect to each residential mortgage loan and consumer loan is the timeliness of scheduled payments. We have a reporting system that monitors past due loans and have adopted policies to pursue creditors rights in order to preserve our collateral position. 
 
 See Note 1- Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance. See also Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our loan portfolio and allowance.

The allowance equaled 56.6 million, or 1.24 of total loans and 573 of nonperforming loans, as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance was comprised of 50.3 million in general reserves relating to performing loans and 6.3 million in specific reserves on other loans, primarily nonperforming loans. Loans with an aggregate carrying value of 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 had been subject to previous partial charge-offs aggregating 0.3 million over the past several years. As of September 30, 2024, there were no specific reserves allocated to loans that had been subject to a previous partial charge-off. 
 
 Although we believe the allowance is adequate to absorb loan losses in our loan portfolio as they arise, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain loan losses in any given period that could be substantial in relation to, or greater than, the size of the allowance. 
 
 The following table reflects the composition of our allowance for credit losses, nonaccrual loans, and net charge-offs as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Securities available for sale increased 86.3 million during the first nine months of 2024, totaling 703 million as of September 30, 2024. Purchases of U.S. Government agency bonds during the first nine months of 2024 aggregated 83.6 million, while proceeds from maturities totaled 22.0 million. There were no purchases of U.S. Government agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities during the first nine months of 2024, while proceeds from principal paydowns aggregated 2.6 million. Purchases of municipal bonds totaled 20.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, while proceeds from matured municipal bonds aggregated 12.0 million. At September 30, 2024, the portfolio was primarily comprised of U.S. Government agency bonds (67 ), municipal bonds (29 and U.S. Government agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (4 ). All of our securities are currently designated as available for sale, and are therefore stated at fair value. The fair value of securities designated as available for sale at September 30, 2024 totaled 703 million, including a net unrealized loss of 45.7 million. The net unrealized loss equaled 63.9 million as of December 31, 2023. After we considered whether the securities were issued by the federal government or its agencies and whether downgrades by bond rating agencies had occurred, we determined that the unrealized losses were due to changing interest rate environments. We maintain the securities portfolio at levels to provide adequate pledging and secondary liquidity for our daily operations. In addition, the securities portfolio serves a primary interest rate risk management function. We expect any upcoming purchases to generally consist of U.S. Government agency bonds and municipal bonds, with the securities portfolio maintained at about 12 to 15 of total assets. 
 
 Market values on our U.S. Government agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and municipal bonds are generally determined on a monthly basis with the assistance of a third-party vendor. Evaluated pricing models that vary by type of security and incorporate available market data are utilized. Standard inputs include issuer and type of security, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and issuer spreads. The market value of certain non-rated securities issued by relatively small municipalities generally located within our markets is estimated at carrying value. We believe our valuation methodology provides for a reasonable estimation of market value, and that it is consistent with the requirements of accounting guidelines. 
 
 FHLBI stock totaled 21.5 million as of September 30, 2024, unchanged from December 31, 2023. Our investment in FHLBI stock is necessary to engage in the FHLBI s advance and other financing programs. We have regularly received quarterly cash dividends, and we expect a cash dividend will continue to be paid in future quarterly periods. 
 
 Interest-earning deposits, a vast majority of which is comprised of funds on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, averaged 206 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 102 million during the first nine months of 2023. The higher average balance primarily reflects an increase in local deposits and our desire to maintain higher levels of on balance sheet liquidity. Historically, we have maintained interest-earning deposits at approximately 75.0 million. 
 
 Net premises and equipment equaled 54.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 50.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Depreciation expense totaled 4.6 million during the first nine months of 2024, while investments associated with the purchase of an office building that will house certain administrative functions and renovations of existing facilities totaled 7.9 million.

Total deposits increased 555 million during the first nine months of 2024, providing for an annualized growth rate of about 19 . Growth in money market deposit accounts and local time deposits more than offset a reduction in business noninterest-bearing checking accounts primarily reflecting the customary level of customers tax and bonus payments and partnership distributions during the early part of each first quarter. FHLBI advances declined 50.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. Wholesale funds, comprised of out-of-area deposits and FHLBI advances, totaled 540 million, or about 11 of total funds, as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 65.4 million during the first nine months of 2024, in large part reflecting the aforementioned customary level of customers tax and bonus payments and partnership distributions in early 2024. Interest-bearing checking accounts increased 75.0 million, primarily reflecting growth in and transfers from noninterest-bearing checking accounts to the IntraFi insured cash sweep account product. Savings deposits were down 32.5 million, in large part reflecting transfers to higher-costing money market deposit and time deposit accounts. Money market deposit accounts increased 484 million, and local time deposits were up 139 million, primarily reflecting growth in deposits from existing customers and initial deposits from new customers stemming from our strategic initiative to grow local deposits to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio. Out-of-area deposits were down 45.2 million from year-end 2023. 
 
 Uninsured deposits totaled approximately 2.3 billion, or about 53 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1.9 billion, or 49 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. The uninsured amounts are estimates based on the methodologies and assumptions we use for regulatory reporting requirements. 
 
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase sweep accounts decreased 8.8 million during the first nine months of 2024, totaling 221 million as of September 30, 2024. The aggregate balance of sweep accounts is subject to relatively large daily fluctuations given the nature of the customers utilizing this product and the sizable balances that many of the customers maintain. The average balance of sweep accounts equaled 226 million during the first nine months of 2024, with a high daily balance of 278 million and a low balance of 166 million. Our sweep account program entails transferring collected funds from certain business noninterest-bearing checking accounts and savings deposits into overnight interest-bearing repurchase agreements. Such sweep accounts are not deposit accounts and are not afforded federal deposit insurance, and are accounted for as secured borrowings. All of our repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings. 
 
 FHLBI advances decreased 50.8 million during the first nine months of 2024, totaling 417 million as of September 30, 2024. Bullet advances aggregating 10.0 million were obtained during the first nine months of 2024, while bullet advance maturities aggregated 60.0 million. Payments on amortizing FHLBI advances totaled 0.8 million. Bullet FHLBI advances are generally obtained to provide funds for loan growth and are used to assist in managing interest rate risk, while amortizing FHLBI advances are generally acquired to match-fund specific longer-term fixed rate commercial loans, with the dollar amount and amortization structure of the underlying advances reflective of the associated commercial loans. FHLBI advances are collateralized by residential mortgage loans, first mortgage liens on multi-family residential property loans, first mortgage liens on commercial real estate property loans, and substantially all other assets of our bank, under a blanket lien arrangement. Our borrowing line of credit as of September 30, 2024 totaled 1.03 billion, with remaining availability based on collateral equaling 607 million. 
 
 Shareholders equity increased 61.2 million during the first nine months of 2024, equaling 583 million at September 30, 2024. Positively impacting shareholders equity during the first nine months of 2024 was net income of 60.0 million, which was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling 16.8 million. Activity relating to the issuance and sale of common stock through various stock-based compensation programs and our dividend reinvestment plan positively impacted shareholders equity by 3.6 million. A 14.4 million after-tax increase in the market value of our available for sale securities portfolio, reflecting a decline in market interest rates, positively impacted shareholders equity during the first nine months of 2024.

Liquidity 
 Liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits, borrowed funds, and capital, or cash flow from the repayment of loans and securities. These funds are used to fund loans, meet deposit withdrawals, and operate our company. Liquidity is primarily achieved through local and out-of-area deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale, matured and called securities, federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits. Asset and liability management is the process of managing our balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximizes profitability, while providing adequate liquidity. 
 
 To assist in providing needed funds and managing interest rate risk, we periodically obtain monies from wholesale funding sources. Wholesale funds, comprised of out-of-area deposits and FHLBI advances, totaled 540 million, or about 11 of total funds, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 636 million, or about 14 of total funds, as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Sweep accounts decreased 8.8 million during the first nine months of 2024, totaling 221 million as of September 30, 2024.

Our borrowing line of credit as of September 30, 2024 totaled 1.03 billion, with remaining availability based on collateral equaling 607 million. 
 
 We also have the ability to borrow up to an aggregate 70.0 million on a daily basis through correspondent banks using established unsecured federal funds purchased lines of credit. We did not access these lines of credit during the first nine months of 2024. In contrast, our interest-earning deposit balance with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago averaged 192 million during the first nine months of 2024. We also have a line of credit through the Discount Window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Using certain municipal bonds as collateral, we could have borrowed up to 158 million as of September 30, 2024. We did not utilize this line of credit during the first nine months of 2024 or at any time during the previous 15 fiscal years, and do not plan to access this line of credit in future periods.

In addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow, we must maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 1.98 billion in unfunded loan commitments and 19.1 million in unfunded standby letters of credit. Of the total unfunded loan commitments, 1.74 billion were commitments available as lines of credit to be drawn at any time as customers cash needs vary, and 236 million were for loan commitments generally expected to close and become funded within the next 12 to 18 months. We regularly monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels, and include such data in our overall liquidity management. 
 
 We monitor our liquidity position and funding strategies on an ongoing basis, but recognize that unexpected events, changes in economic or market conditions, a reduction in earnings performance, declining capital levels or situations beyond our control could cause liquidity challenges. We have developed contingency funding plans that provide a framework for meeting liquidity disruptions. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Shareholders equity increased 61.2 million during the first nine months of 2024, equaling 583 million at September 30, 2024. Positively impacting shareholders equity during the first nine months of 2024 was net income of 60.0 million, which was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling 16.8 million. Activity relating to the issuance and sale of common stock through various stock-based compensation programs and our dividend reinvestment plan positively impacted shareholders equity by 3.6 million. A 14.4 million after-tax increase in the market value of our available for sale securities portfolio, reflecting a decline in market interest rates, positively impacted shareholders equity during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 We and our bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, our bank s total risk-based capital ratio was 13.9 , compared to 13.4 at December 31, 2023. Our bank s total regulatory capital increased 52.6 million during the first nine months of 2024, in large part reflecting net income totaling 68.2 million, which was partially offset by cash dividends paid to us aggregating 21.8 million. Our bank s total risk-based capital ratio was also impacted by a 202 million increase in total risk-weighted assets, in large part reflecting net growth in commercial loans. As of September 30, 2024, our bank s total regulatory capital equaled 747 million, or 209 million in excess of the 10.0 minimum that is among the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized. Our and our bank s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are disclosed in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations 
 We recorded net income of 19.6 million, or 1.22 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net income of 20.9 million, or 1.30 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. We recorded net income of 60.0 million, or 3.72 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024, compared with net income of 62.2 million, or 3.89 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. Diluted earnings per share decreased 0.08, or 6.2 , during the third quarter of 2024, and 0.17, or 4.4 , during the first nine months of 2024, compared with the respective prior-year periods. 
 
 The lower levels of net income during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the respective 2023 periods resulted from increased overhead costs and decreased net interest income, which more than offset higher levels of noninterest income. The increase in noninterest expense during the 2024 periods mainly resulted from larger salary and data processing costs; increased contributions to the Foundation also contributed to the higher level of overhead costs during the first nine months of 2024. Net interest income declined during the 2024 periods as higher yields on, along with growth in, earning assets were more than offset by an increased cost of funds. The growth in noninterest income during the 2024 periods primarily resulted from increased mortgage banking income and treasury management fees; higher levels of payroll service fees also contributed to the increased noninterest income during the periods. Revenue associated with a private equity investment and benefit claims on bank owned life insurance policies positively impacted noninterest income during the first nine months of 2024. The provision expense recorded during the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected an increase in environmental factor allocations and allocations necessitated by net loan growth, which were partially offset by decreases in the calculated allowance due primarily from the payoffs of two larger problem commercial lending relationships previously included in the collective evaluation. The provision expense recorded during the first nine months of 2024 mainly reflected individual allocations assigned to two different nonperforming nonreal-estate-related commercial loan relationships and allocations necessitated by net loan growth, which were partly offset by the aforementioned reduction in the calculated allowance. The provision expense recorded during the prior-year third quarter mainly reflected the establishment of a specific reserve for a distressed commercial loan relationship, a qualitative factor assessment for local economic conditions, allocations necessitated by net loan growth, and a higher reserve for residential mortgage loans stemming from slower principal prepayment rates and the resulting extended average life of the portfolio. The provision expense recorded during the first nine months of 2023 generally reflected allocations necessitated by net loan growth, adjustments to historical loss information to better represent our expectations for future credit losses, and the previously mentioned higher reserve for residential mortgage loans. 
 
 Interest income during the third quarter of 2024 was 83.4 million, an increase of 12.3 million, or 17.2 , from the 71.1 million earned during the third quarter of 2023. The increase resulted from growth in, and a higher yield on, average earning assets. Average earning assets equaled 5.45 billion during the third quarter of 2024, up 561 million, or 11.5 , from the level of 4.89 billion during the prior-year third quarter; average loans were up 413 million, average interest-earning deposits grew 75.3 million, and average securities increased 73.2 million. The yield on average earning assets was 6.08 during the third quarter of 2024, up from 5.78 during the respective 2023 period. The higher yield primarily resulted from an increased yield on loans. The yield on loans was 6.69 during the third quarter of 2024, up from 6.37 during the third quarter of 2023 mainly due to higher interest rates on variable-rate commercial loans resulting from the FOMC raising the targeted federal funds rate in an effort to curb elevated inflation levels and a significant level of commercial loans being originated over the past 15 months in the higher interest rate environment. The FOMC increased the targeted federal funds rate by 25 basis points in July of 2023, at which time average variable-rate commercial loans represented approximately 65 of average total commercial loans. The positive impact of the rate hike was partially mitigated by the FOMC s lowering of the targeted federal funds rate by 50 basis points in mid-September 2024. Increased yields on securities and interest-earning deposits, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, also contributed to the improved yield on average earning assets. 
 
 Interest income during the first nine months of 2024 was 239 million, an increase of 41.5 million, or 21.0 , from the 198 million earned during the first nine months of 2023. The increase stemmed from growth in, and a higher yield on, average earning assets. Average earning assets equaled 5.25 billion during the first nine months of 2024, up 520 million, or 11.0 , from the level of 4.73 billion during the first nine months of 2023; average loans increased 387 million, average interest-earning deposits were up 104 million, and average securities grew 28.7 million. The yield on average earning assets was 6.06 during the first nine months of 2024, up from 5.59 during the respective 2023 period. The higher yield mainly resulted from an increased yield on loans, which rose from 6.16 during the first nine months of 2023 to 6.66 during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to higher interest rates on variable-rate commercial loans stemming from FOMC rate hikes and a substantial level of commercial loans being originated since the beginning of 2023 in the higher interest rate environment. The FOMC increased the targeted federal funds rate by 100 basis points during the period of February 2023 through July 2023, during which time average variable-rate commercial loans represented approximately 65 of average total commercial loans. The positive impact of the rate hikes was somewhat mitigated by the FOMC s lowering of the targeted federal funds rate by 50 basis points in mid-September 2024. An increased yield on securities, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, also contributed to the improved yield on average earning assets.

Interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 was 35.1 million, an increase of 12.9 million, or 58.3 , from the 22.2 million expensed during the third quarter of 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to a higher average weighted cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which grew from 2.69 during the third quarter of 2023 to 3.53 during the current-year third quarter primarily due to higher rates on deposits and borrowings. A change in funding mix, mainly consisting of a decrease in noninterest-bearing and lower-cost deposits and an increase in higher-cost money market accounts and time deposits stemming from deposit migration and new deposit relationships, also contributed to the increased cost of funds. Reflecting the higher interest rate environment, the cost of interest-bearing, non-time deposits increased from 2.17 during the third quarter of 2023 to 2.96 during the third quarter of 2024, while the cost of time deposits increased from 3.85 to 4.79 during the respective periods. The heightened cost of interest-bearing, non-time deposits primarily resulted from increased rates paid on, and levels of, higher-cost money market and interest-bearing business checking accounts. The cost of borrowed funds increased from 2.98 during the third quarter of 2023 to 3.75 during the third quarter of 2024 mainly due to higher costs of sweep accounts and FHLBI advances. The cost of sweep accounts increased from 1.33 during the third quarter of 2023 to 3.73 during the third quarter of 2024, while the cost of FHLBI advances increased from 2.78 to 3.00 during the respective periods, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Growth in interest-bearing liabilities also contributed to the increase in interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year third quarter. Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled 3.94 billion during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.27 billion during the third quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 669 million, or 20.4 . 
 
 Interest expense during the first nine months of 2024 was 96.3 million, an increase of 43.6 million, or 82.9 , from the 52.7 million expensed during the first nine months of 2023. The increase primarily stemmed from a higher average weighted cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which rose from 2.28 during the first nine months of 2023 to 3.40 during the respective 2024 period mainly due to higher rates on deposits and borrowings. A change in funding mix, mainly comprising of a decline in noninterest-bearing and lower-cost deposits and an increase in higher-cost money market accounts and time deposits stemming from deposit migration and new deposit relationships, also contributed to the increased cost of funds. Reflecting the higher interest rate environment, the cost of interest-bearing, non-time deposits increased from 1.77 during the first nine months of 2023 to 2.80 during the first nine months of 2024, while the cost of time deposits increased from 3.25 to 4.71 during the respective periods. The higher cost of interest-bearing, non-time deposits primarily resulted from increased rates paid on, and amounts of, money market and interest-bearing business checking accounts. The cost of borrowed funds increased from 2.82 during the first nine months of 2023 to 3.60 during the first nine months of 2024 mainly due to higher costs of sweep accounts and FHLBI advances. The cost of sweep accounts increased from 1.22 during the first nine months of 2023 to 3.32 during the first nine months of 2024, while the cost of FHLBI advances increased from 2.57 to 2.96 during the respective periods, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Growth in interest-bearing liabilities also contributed to the increase in interest expense during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the respective 2023 period. Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled 3.77 billion during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 3.08 billion during the first nine months of 2023, representing an increase of 688 million, or 22.3 . 
 
 Net interest income during the third quarter of 2024 was 48.3 million, a decrease of 0.7 million, or 1.4 , from the 49.0 million earned during the respective 2023 period. The decline reflected a lower net interest margin, which more than offset growth in earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.52 in the third quarter of 2024, down from 3.98 in the prior-year third quarter due to a higher cost of funds, which more than offset an increased yield on earning assets. The cost of funds equaled 2.56 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 1.80 in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher costs of deposits and borrowed funds, reflecting the impact of the higher interest rate environment, and a change in funding mix, mainly consisting of a decrease in noninterest-bearing and lower-cost deposits and an increase in higher-cost money market accounts and time deposits stemming from deposit migration and new deposit relationships. The increased yield on average earning assets mainly resulted from a higher yield on commercial loans primarily stemming from the previously mentioned FOMC rate hike and a significant level of commercial loans being originated over the past 15 months in the higher interest rate environment. 
 
 Net interest income during the first nine months of 2024 was 143 million, a decline of 2.2 million, or 1.5 , from the 145 million earned during the respective 2023 period. The decrease reflected a lower net interest margin, which more than offset growth in earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.62 in the first nine months of 2024, down from 4.10 in the first nine months of 2023 due to an increased cost of funds, which more than offset a higher yield on earning assets. The cost of funds equaled 2.44 in the first nine months of 2024, up from 1.49 in the respective prior-year period mainly due to higher costs of deposits and borrowed funds, reflecting the impact of the heightened interest rate environment, and a change in funding mix, comprising of a decline in noninterest-bearing and lower-cost deposits and an increase in higher-cost money market accounts and time deposits resulting from deposit migration and new deposit relationships. The increased yield on average earning assets primarily resulted from a higher yield on commercial loans mainly stemming from the aforementioned FOMC rate hikes and a substantial level of commercial loans being originated since the beginning of 2023 in the higher interest rate environment. 
 
 The following tables set forth certain information relating to our consolidated average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and reflect the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the period presented. Tax-exempt securities interest income and yield for the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 have been computed on a tax equivalent basis using a marginal tax rate of 21.0 . Securities interest income was increased by 60,000 in the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023 and 180,000 in the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023 for this non-GAAP, but industry standard, adjustment. These adjustments equated to increases in our net interest margin of less than one basis point for each of the 2024 and 2023 periods.

MERCANTILE BANK CORPORATION

Provisions for credit losses of 1.1 million and 3.3 million were recorded during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 5.9 million during both the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The provision expense recorded during the current-year third quarter primarily reflected an increase in environmental factor allocations and allocations necessitated by net loan growth, which were partially offset by reductions in the calculated allowance due primarily from the payoffs of two larger problem commercial lending relationships previously included in the collective evaluation. The provision expense recorded during the first nine months of 2024 mainly reflected individual allocations assigned to two different nonperforming nonreal-estate-related commercial loan relationships and allocations necessitated by net loan growth, which were partly offset by the previously mentioned decrease in the calculated allowance. The provision expense recorded during the third quarter of 2023 mainly reflected the establishment of a specific reserve for a distressed commercial loan relationship, a qualitative factor assessment for local economic conditions, allocations necessitated by net loan growth, and a higher reserve for residential mortgage loans resulting from slower principal prepayment rates and the resulting extended average life of the portfolio. The provision expense recorded during the first nine months of 2023 generally reflected allocations necessitated by net loan growth, adjustments to historical loss information to better represent our expectations for future credit losses, and the aforementioned higher reserve for residential mortgage loans. Sustained strength in loan quality metrics, including low levels of loan charge-offs, during the 2024 and 2023 periods largely mitigated additional reserves associated with the above-mentioned factors. 
 
 Noninterest income totaled 9.7 million during the third quarter of 2024, up 0.4 million, or 4.6 , from the 9.3 million recorded during the third quarter of 2023. The growth primarily resulted from increases in mortgage banking income, treasury management fees, and payroll service fees. The higher level of mortgage banking income mainly resulted from increases in the percentage of loans originated with the intent to sell, which rose from approximately 64 during the third quarter of 2023 to approximately 80 during the third quarter of 2024, and total loan originations, which were up approximately 48 in the current-year third quarter compared to the respective 2023 period. The increase in treasury management fees primarily stemmed from customers expanded use of cash management products. Growth in bank owned life insurance income and credit and debit card income also contributed to the higher level of noninterest income. Noninterest income during the third quarter of 2023 included a 0.4 million gain on sale of other real estate owned. 
 
 Noninterest income totaled 30.2 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 23.8 million during the first nine months of 2023. Noninterest income during the first nine months of 2024 included bank owned life insurance death benefit claims and gains on the sales of other real estate owned totaling 0.7 million and 0.4 million, respectively, while noninterest income during the respective 2023 period included a gain on the sale of other real estate owned of 0.4 million. Excluding these transactions, noninterest income increased 5.6 million, or 24.0 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The growth primarily stemmed from higher levels of mortgage banking income, mainly reflecting increases in the percentage of residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and total loan production, and treasury management fees, in large part reflecting customers expanded use of cash management products. The percentage of residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell increased from approximately 49 during the first nine months of 2023 to approximately 77 during the first nine months of 2024, and total loans originated were up nearly 22 during the respective periods. Increases in payroll service fees, along with revenue associated with a private equity investment, also contributed to the growth in noninterest income. 
 
 Noninterest expense totaled 32.3 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 28.9 million during the prior-year third quarter. Noninterest expense totaled 92.0 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 85.3 million during the first nine months of 2023. The increases during the 2024 periods primarily resulted from larger salary costs, reflecting annual merit pay increases, market adjustments, higher residential mortgage lender commissions and incentives, and lower residential mortgage loan deferred salary costs; an increased bonus accrual also contributed to the higher salary costs in the current-year third quarter compared to the prior-year third quarter. Higher levels of data processing costs, mainly reflecting increased transaction volume and software support costs, and health insurance claims also contributed to the rises in noninterest expense during both 2024 periods. A reduced credit reserve for unfunded loan commitments during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 partially mitigated the increases in the overhead costs noted above in the respective periods. Noninterest expense during the third quarter of 2023, first nine months of 2024, and first nine months of 2023 included contributions to the Foundation totaling 0.4 million, 0.7 million, and 0.4 million, respectively, while overhead costs during the first nine months of 2023 included a 0.4 million write-down of a former branch facility. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded income before federal income tax of 24.5 million and a federal income tax expense of 4.9 million. During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded income before federal income tax of 26.0 million and a federal income tax expense of 5.1 million. During the first nine months of 2024, we recorded income before federal income tax of 75.1 million and a federal income tax expense of 15.1 million. During the first nine months of 2023, we recorded income before federal income tax of 77.5 million and a federal income tax expense of 15.3 million. The decreases in federal income tax expense during the 2024 periods compared to the respective prior-year periods primarily resulted from a lower level of income before federal income tax. Our election to apply the proportional amortization method to our tax credit equity investments during the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in 0.1 million and 0.3 million in tax expense being recorded during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. Amortization costs related to tax credit equity investments were included in noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2023. Our effective tax rate was 20.1 during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to 19.7 during the respective 2023 periods. The tax credit equity investments-related tax election negatively impacted the effective tax rate in the 2024 periods, while the previously mentioned bank owned life insurance death benefit claims, substantially all of which were nontaxable, positively impacted the effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, liquidity risk. All of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure. We have only limited agricultural-related loan assets and therefore have no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices. Any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant. Interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates. We derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest-earning assets over the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. The rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Since market interest rates change over time, we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes. Accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and soundness. 
 
 Evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure. Our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems and internal control procedures are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. In evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk, we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity and asset quality. 
 
 We use two interest rate risk measurement techniques. The first, which is commonly referred to as GAP analysis, measures the difference between the dollar amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period. A significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates.

The second interest rate risk measurement we use is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis. We believe that this methodology provides a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk than the GAP analysis, and therefore, it serves as our primary interest rate risk measurement technique. The simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates. 
 
 Key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets; cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities; and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment; therefore, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies, among other factors. 
 
 We conducted multiple simulations as of September 30, 2024, in which it was assumed that changes in market interest rates occurred ranging from up 300 basis points to down 400 basis points in equal quarterly instalments over the next twelve months. The following table reflects the suggested dollar and percentage changes in net interest income over the next twelve months in comparison to the 206 million in net interest income projected using our balance sheet amounts and anticipated replacement rates as of September 30, 2024. The resulting estimates are generally within our policy parameters established to manage and monitor interest rate risk.

The resulting estimates have been significantly impacted by the current interest rate and economic environments, as adjustments have been made to critical model inputs with regards to traditional interest rate relationships. This is especially important as it relates to floating rate commercial loans, which comprise a sizable portion of our balance sheet. 
 
 In addition to changes in interest rates, the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables, including: the growth, composition and absolute levels of loans, deposits, and other earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; level of nonperforming assets; economic and competitive conditions; potential changes in lending, investing, and deposit gathering strategies; client preferences; and other factors. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 We made no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 On May 27, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to 20.0 million of our common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or by other means in accordance with applicable regulations. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our stock, general market and economic conditions, our capital position, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, and applicable legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at any time. No shares were repurchased during the first nine months of 2024. Historically, stock repurchases have been funded from cash dividends paid to us from our bank. Additional repurchases may be made in future periods under the authorized plan or a new plan, which would also likely be funded from cash dividends paid to us from our bank. As of September 30, 2024, repurchases aggregating 6.8 million were available to be made under the current repurchase program.
