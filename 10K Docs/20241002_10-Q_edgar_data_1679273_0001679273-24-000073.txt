 This MD A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and related condensed notes included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We have also presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative expenses SG A ), each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement the financial information included in this report. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted SG A, and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income, gross profit, or SG A, as applicable. For more information, refer to the Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Financial Measures sections below. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 In a challenging operating environment, we delivered first quarter financial results that were generally in line with our expectations, driven by sequentially improved volume performance, solid price/mix, and strict management of operating costs. Restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand, relative to supply, however, continue to be soft, and we believe it will remain soft through the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 
 To drive operational and cost efficiencies and improve cash flows, on October 1, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan that includes the permanent closure of an older, higher-cost processing facility and the temporary curtailment of certain production lines and schedules in our manufacturing network in North America. Together, we expect these actions will help us better manage our factory utilization rates and ease some of the industry s current supply-demand imbalance in North America. We also announced actions to reduce operating expenses, including reducing global headcount and eliminating certain unfilled job positions, as well as reducing estimated fiscal 2025 capital expenditures by 100 million. 
 
 In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we expect to record total pre-tax charges of 200 million to 250 million in fiscal 2025 (most of which will be recorded during the fiscal second quarter), of which we estimate that approximately 80 will be cash and 20 will be non-cash. The charges primarily relate to the costs associated with contracted raw potatoes that will not be used due to production line curtailments, accelerating depreciation of assets, the write-down of inventory and long-lived assets, employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. In fiscal 2025, we expect these actions to deliver approximately 55 million of pre-tax savings (approximately 85 million on an annualized basis) and reduce working capital. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 Despite a challenging environment, in fiscal 2025, we expect higher sales volumes and improved mix will drive sales growth on a constant currency basis, as compared to fiscal 2024. We expect volume will decline during the first half of fiscal 2025 due to the impact of market share losses and menu price inflation, which we believe will continue to affect global restaurant traffic and demand for frozen potato products. We anticipate that volume will increase in the second half of fiscal 2025 as we lap the prior-year impact of transitioning to our new ERP system and benefit from recent customer contract wins. 
 
 We expect our earnings will decline as higher manufacturing costs per pound driven by input cost inflation, costs associated with the Restructuring Plan, investments in price and trade to attract and retain volume, and higher depreciation expense associated with our recent capacity expansion efforts will more than offset the benefits of volume growth, improved mix, and cost saving initiatives. We anticipate that input costs, in the aggregate, will continue to rise, but at a more moderate rate as compared to fiscal 2024. We expect that an increase in SG A will reflect charges associated with the Restructuring Plan, higher performance-based compensation expense, incremental non-cash amortization of prior investments in our ERP infrastructure, inflation, and investments in our information technology infrastructure, and will largely be offset by cost savings from our Restructuring Plan and other cost saving initiatives. 
 
 We believe the proactive restructuring actions will improve our operating efficiency, profitability, and cash flows, while also helping to position us to continue to make strategic investments to support our customers and create value for our stakeholders over the long-term.

 Net Sales 
 Compared to the prior year quarter, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 declined 11.2 million, or 1 , to 1,654.1 million. 
 
 Volume declined 3 , largely reflecting the impact of customer share losses, soft restaurant traffic trends, the carryover effect of our decision in the prior year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe to strategically manage customer and product mix, and the impact of a previously announced voluntary product withdrawal initiated in late fiscal 2024. The volume decline was partially offset by growth in key international markets. Price/mix increased 2 , reflecting the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in Europe and North America, and was partially offset by unfavorable channel and product mix, as well as targeted investments in price and trade support to attract and retain volume. 
 
 North America segment net sales, which includes all sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, declined 31.7 million, or 3 , to 1,103.7 million. Volume declined 4 , largely reflecting the impact of customer share losses and declining restaurant traffic in the U.S. Price/mix increased 1 , reflecting the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 for contracts with large and regional chain restaurant customers, partially offset by unfavorable channel and product mix, as well as targeted investments in price and trade support across all sales channels. 
 
 International segment net sales, which includes all sales to customers outside of North America, increased 20.5 million, or 4 , to 550.4 million. Volume declined 1 , due to the carryover effect of our decision in the prior year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in Europe, as well as the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal. The decline was partially offset by volume growth in key international markets outside of Europe. Price/mix increased 5 reflecting pricing actions announced this fiscal year to counter input cost inflation. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit declined 143.5 million versus the prior year quarter to 356.0 million, and included 2.9 million 2.2 million after-tax, or 0.01 per share) of unrealized gains related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity hedging contracts. The prior year quarter included 31.7 million 23.8 million after-tax, with 0.16 per share impact) of unrealized gains related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with commodity hedging contracts, and 22.5 million of costs 16.7 million after-tax, or 0.11 per share) associated with the sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value following the completion of our acquisition of the remaining interest in LW EMEA. 
 
 Adjusted Gross Profit declined 137.2 million versus the prior year quarter to 353.1 million. Higher manufacturing costs per pound, an approximately 39 million loss associated with the voluntary product withdrawal, lower sales volumes, and higher warehouse costs drove the decline, and was partially offset by a net benefit from pricing actions. The higher manufacturing costs per pound largely reflected input cost inflation, which was primarily driven by higher raw 
 19

 potato costs; utilization-related production costs and inefficiencies; and 15.5 million of higher depreciation expense largely associated with our recent capacity expansions in China and the U.S. We do not expect further significant sales or earnings impact from the voluntary product withdrawal during the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A declined 32.3 million versus the prior year quarter to 143.9 million, and included a gain of 16.6 million (before and after-tax, or 0.12 per share) related to blue chip swap transactions in Argentina (as described below), 0.6 million 0.5 million after-tax, or 0.01 per share) of foreign currency exchange losses, and 6.0 million 4.4 million after-tax, or 0.03 per share) of unrealized gains related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency hedging contracts. The prior year quarter included 7.4 million 5.5 million after-tax, or 0.04 per share) of foreign currency exchange losses, 4.4 million 3.3 million after-tax, or 0.02 per share) of unrealized losses related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency hedging contracts, and 4.0 million of LW EMEA integration and acquisition-related expenses 3.0 million after-tax, or 0.02 per share). 
 
 Adjusted SG A increased 5.5 million versus the prior year quarter to 165.9 million, primarily due to 6.1 million of incremental non-cash amortization and expense related to our new ERP system. The benefit of cost savings initiatives essentially offset inflation and information technology investments. 
 Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Net income declined 107.4 million from the prior year quarter to 127.4 million. Net income in the current quarter included a total net gain of 22.7 million 24.9 million before tax, or 0.15 per share) for gains resulting from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, foreign currency exchange losses, and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses. Net income in the prior year quarter included a total net loss of 4.7 million 6.6 million before tax, or 0.03 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses, and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses, and items impacting comparability. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA declined 122.9 million from the prior year quarter to 289.9 million, primarily due to lower sales and Adjusted Gross Profit, which includes an approximately 39 million loss associated with the voluntary product withdrawal. 
 
 North America Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined 103.3 million versus the prior year quarter to 276.1 million. Higher manufacturing costs per pound, an approximately 21 million charge for the voluntary product withdrawal related to products manufactured in North America, and lower sales volumes drove the decline, which was partially offset by a net benefit from pricing actions. 
 
 International Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined 39.1 million versus the prior year quarter to 50.5 million. An approximately 18 million impact associated with the voluntary product withdrawal and higher manufacturing costs per pound largely drove the decline, which was partially offset by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased 14.5 million versus the prior year quarter to 45.2 million, reflecting the impact of higher total debt outstanding, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and less capitalized interest related to our manufacturing expansion projects, net of interest income. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was 50.8 million and 69.9 million, respectively. The effective income tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 28.5 and 22.9 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate varied between periods due to a higher proportion of earnings in our International segment in fiscal 2025, as compared with fiscal 2024, and discrete tax items. 
 Equity Method Investment Earnings 
 Equity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures were earnings of 11.3 million and 12.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The results in the current quarter and prior year quarter

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 As of August 25, 2024, we had 120.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, with 1,004.0 million of available liquidity under our global revolving credit facility. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our global revolving credit facility , are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our business requirements. Our funding requirements include capital expenditures for announced manufacturing capacity expansions in the Netherlands and Argentina, working capital requirements, and shareholder returns, including cash dividends and repurchases under our share repurchase program. As discussed under Executive Summary in this MD A, as we implement cost-reduction measures under the Restructuring Plan, we expect reductions in operating expenditures, cost of sales and capital expenditures will drive operational efficiencies and improve cash flows, while helping to position us to continue to fund strategic investments to support our customers. 
 Cash Flows 
 Below is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities: 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended (in millions) August 25, 2024 August 27, 2023 Net cash flows provided by (used for): Operating activities 330.2 334.6 Investing activities (335.6) (304.8) Financing activities 52.2 (171.7) 46.8 (141.9) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2.6 0.4 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 49.4 (141.5) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 71.4 304.8 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 120.8 163.3 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities declined 4.4 million versus the prior year quarter to 330.2 million. The decline related to a 122.1 million decrease in income from operations, adjusted for non-cash income and expenses, partially offset by 117.7 million of cash increase for favorable changes in working capital, primarily related to no performance-based incentive compensation benefit payments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and the timing of accounts payable. See Results of Operations in this MD A for more information related to the increase in income from operations. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used 335.6 million of cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with 304.8 million in the same period in the prior year. Expenditures in both periods primarily related to our investments to expand our french fry capacity and other facility modernization efforts in China, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Argentina. In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we decreased our estimate of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 by 100 million to 750 million excluding acquisitions, which included pausing the next phase of our ERP build and implementation. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, net proceeds from short-term borrowings were 203.6 million which were primarily used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We used 92.2 million of cash to repurchase 1,412,852 shares of our common stock at an average 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 price of 58.04 per share, and we withheld 178,941 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid 51.7 million in cash dividends to common stockholders and repaid 10.2 million of debt and financing obligations. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2024 , we used 113.5 million of cash to repurchase 992,365 shares of our common stock at an average price of 100.77 per share, and we withheld 132,067 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid 40.8 million of cash dividends to our common stockholders and repaid 32.9 million of short-term borrowings and 13.7 million of other debt and financing obligations. These financing uses were partially offset by 15.1 million of borrowings under our credit facilities. 
 For more information about our debt, interest rates, maturity dates, and covenants, see Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this report and Note 6, Debt and Financing Obligations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Form 10-K. At August 25, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant ratios and other covenants contained in our debt agreements. 
 
 Obligations and Commitments 
 On September 27, 2024, we entered into a new 500 million term loan facility, the proceeds of which were used to repay the remaining 225 million balance of our Term A-1 loan facility and 275 million of outstanding borrowings under our global revolving credit facility. Except for these transactions, there have been no other material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Form 10-K. 
 See Note 9, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements" of this report for more information. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted SG A, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in analyzing what management views as our core operating performance for purposes of business decision making. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses and other items affecting comparability between periods, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our core operating performance across periods, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial results. In addition, we believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affecting our underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP that are also presented in this report. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, gross profit, SG A, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way we do.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, we may periodically enter into derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, but not for trading purposes. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of August 25, 2024 and May 26, 2024. Actual results may differ materially. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. We may use commodity swap or forward purchase contracts, in addition to sourcing from multiple providers, to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in oil and energy prices. Based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of August 25, 2024, a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would have resulted in a charge to Cost of sales of 8.2 million 6.1 million after-tax). Based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of May 26, 2024, a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would have resulted in a charge to Cost of sales of 9.2 million 6.9 million after-tax). We expect that any change in the fair value of these contracts, real or hypothetical, would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. Our operations in foreign countries export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on our financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of our international operations local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. Indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of exports out of the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). The currency that has the most impact is the Euro. From time to time, we may economically hedge currency risk with foreign currency contracts, such as forward contracts. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curre ncies, we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of 61.8 million 47.0 million after-tax) and 63.3 million 48.1 million after-tax) as of August 25, 2024 and May 26, 2024, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions, and from time to time, we may enter into interest rate swaps to manage risk. At August 25, 2024, we had 2,495.0 million of fixed-rate and 1,548.7 million of variable-rate debt outstanding. At May 26, 2024, we had 2,495.0 million of fixed-rate and 1,341.7 million of variable-rate debt outstanding. We have interest rate risk associated with our variable-rate debt. A one percent increase in interest rates related to variable-rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of 15.7 million annually 12.0 million after-tax) and 13.6 million annually 10.6 million after-tax) at August 25, 2024 and May 26, 2024, respectively.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Due to these limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks, including that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of August 25, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended August 25, 2024, and determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 25, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Restructuring Plan 
 
 We are reporting the following information for the purpose of providing the disclosure required under Form 8-K Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan that is designed to drive operational and cost efficiencies and improve cash flows, while positioning the Company to continue to make strategic investments to drive long-term value for our stakeholders. The Restructuring Plan is being implemented in response to current operating environment facing the Company and includes: 
 
 The permanent closure of our manufacturing facility in Connell, Washington, effective October 1, 2024; 
 The temporary curtailment of certain production lines and schedules across our manufacturing network in North America; 
 A reduction in operating expenses, including headcount reductions approximating of our global workforce and the elimination of certain unfilled job positions; and 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 A 100 million reduction in fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to 750 million from our previous estimate of 850 million. 
 
 In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we expect to record in fiscal 2025 total pre-tax charges of 200 million to 250 million. We estimate that approximately 80 (or approximately 160 million to 200 million) of these charges will result in future cash expenditures and 20 (or approximately 40 million to 50 million) will be non-cash charges. These charges primarily relate to the costs associated with contracted raw potatoes that will not be used due to production line curtailments, accelerating depreciation of assets, the write-down of inventory and long-lived assets, employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. We expect to record most of the pre-tax charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, with the remainder expected to be recorded during the second half of fiscal 2025. 
 
 For additional information regarding the Restructuring Plan, see Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 
 Insider Trading Arrangements 
 
 Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5 1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended August 25, 2024, no such plans or arrangements were or , including by modification.

(ii) Change of Control.

(d) Specified Employee. Notwithstanding anything (including any provision of the Agreement or the Plan) to the contrary, if a Participant is a Specified Employee and if the RSUs are subject to Section 409A of the Code, payment to the Participant on account of a Separation from Service shall, to the extent required to comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2), be made to the Participant on the earlier of (i) the Participant s death or (ii) the first business day (or within 30 days after such first business day) that is more than six months after the date of Separation from Service. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Participant shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company or any Subsidiary for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until the Participant has incurred a Separation from Service. In the Company s sole and absolute discretion, interest may be paid due to such delay. Further, any interest will be calculated in the manner determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion in a manner that qualifies any interest as reasonable earnings under Section 409A of the Code. Dividend equivalents will not be paid with respect to any dividends that would have been paid during the delay if the Stock had been issued. To the extent required for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each installment that vests under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. 4.

If such Change of Control does not qualify, the Participant is entitled to receive the corresponding payment on the date that would have otherwise applied pursuant to Section 3 as though such Change of Control had not occurred. (ii) Change of Control. If there are such Vested Performance Shares upon a Change of Control, one share of Stock will be issued for each such Vested Performance Share as of the date of the Change of Control; provided, however, that if such Change of Control would not qualify as a permissible date of distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, and where Section 409A of the Code applies to such distribution, the Participant is entitled to receive the corresponding payment on the date that would have otherwise applied pursuant to Section 3 as though such Change of Control had not occurred. (iii) Death. If there are such Vested Performance Shares upon the Participant s termination due to such Participant s death pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii) hereof, one share of Stock will be issued for each such Vested Performance Share within thirty days of the date of the termination.

It is a condition to the Participant s receipt of the Performance Shares that the Participant execute and agree to the terms of the Company or a Subsidiary s current and applicable 

10 Confidentiality Agreement (the Confidentiality Agreement ). By electronically accepting this Agreement, the Participant acknowledges that the Participant has either already entered into such Confidentiality Agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary as of the date of acceptance or will enter into such agreement within 30 days of the Participant s receipt of this grant of Performance Shares. If such execution is required and the Participant does not sign and return the Confidentiality Agreement as prompted by the Workday HR system within 30 days of the Participant s receipt of this grant of Performance Shares, this grant of Performance Shares and any rights to the Performance Shares will terminate and become null and void. The Participant further acknowledges that as consideration for the Participant s agreement to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company is providing the Participant with the opportunity to participate in this grant of Performance Shares under the Plan and receive the Performance Shares evidenced by this Agreement. The Participant understands that this acknowledgment shall be deemed a part of the Confidentiality Agreement and is to be interpreted in a manner consistent with its terms. (b) Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation. By electronically accepting this Agreement, the Participant acknowledges that the Participant has received or will receive specialized training, trade secrets and confidential information from the Company and, in consideration thereof, agrees to the non- competition and non-solicitation provisions set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement (the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Obligations ). The Participant further acknowledges that as consideration for the Participant s agreement to the terms of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Obligations, the Company is providing the Participant with the opportunity to participate in this grant of Performance Shares under the Plan and receive the Performance Shares evidenced by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is a resident of the state of California, the Participant will not be bound by the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Obligations. (c) Violation of Restrictive Covenants. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Participant breaches the Confidentiality Agreement or, if applicable, any of the Non-Competition and Non- Solicitation Obligations, (i) the Participant shall forfeit all Performance Shares and related dividend equivalents evidenced by this Agreement, effective on the date on which the Participant first breached such agreement or obligation(s) and (ii) if such breach occurs within 1 year following (A) the Vesting Date or (B) to the extent Section 3(b) applies, the applicable settlement date, all shares of Stock issued or transferred to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall be returned by the Participant to the Company within 30 days after the Company has provided notice to the Participant of such breach and, if such shares of Stock have been sold by the Participant, an amount equal to the proceeds from such sale (determined without regard to any taxes paid) shall become due and payable by the Participant to the Company within 30 days after the Company has provided notice to the Participant of such breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the Participant obligations described in clause (i) and (ii) at any time if deemed to be in the best interests of the Company. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that it would be inequitable for the Participant to benefit from the Performance Shares should the Participant breach the Confidentiality Agreement or, if applicable, any of the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Obligations. (d) Remedies; Government Investigations; DTSA. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the rights and remedies set forth in this Section 18 are in addition to and are not intended to limit any other rights or remedies the Company may have available to it, both during and at any time after the termination of the Participant s employment with the Company, including, without limitation, any rights or remedies the Company may have under the Confidentiality Agreement or other similar agreements. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement prevents the Participant from providing, without prior notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations, and, for purpose of clarity, the Participant is not prohibited from providing information voluntarily to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore, the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 DTSA provides that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made (A) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. In addition, the DTSA provides that an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 

11 19. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to that state s conflict of laws rules. The Participant agrees that the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware, without regard to or application or conflict of laws principles, will have jurisdiction in any action, suit or proceeding against the Participant on or arising out of this Agreement, and the Participant hereby: (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to service of process in connection with any action, suit or proceeding against the Participant; and (c) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction, venue or service of process. The Participant agrees that this Section 19 is necessary so that the Company has uniformity with respect to interpretation of this Agreement for all participants, no matter where they may reside. 20. Acknowledgements. The Participant acknowledges that Exhibit A to this Agreement includes restrictive covenants that could affect the Participant s ability to seek employment after the Participant s termination of employment with the Company. The Participant agrees that the Participant has had at least fourteen (14) days to review this Agreement before being required to execute it (through online acceptance). The Participant further acknowledges and understands that the Participant has the right to seek advice from counsel of Participant s choosing before accepting this Agreement.
