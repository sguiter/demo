of the members interests of Pinon Ridge Mining LLC PRM ), a Delaware limited liability company. The transaction
constituted a reverse takeover RTO of Western by PRM. Subsequent to obtaining appropriate shareholder approvals, the
Company reconstituted its Board of Directors and senior management team. Western is a Canadian domestic issuer and Canadian reporting
issuer. 

The Company s registered office is located
at 330 Bay Street, Suite 1400, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 2S8, and its common shares are listed on the CSE under the symbol WUC. 
On April 22, 2016, the Company s common shares began trading on the OTC Pink Open Market, and on May 23, 2016, the Company s
common shares were approved for trading on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol WSTRF . The Company s principal
business activity is the acquisition and development of uranium and vanadium resource properties in the states of Utah and Colorado in
the United States of America United States ). 

On September 16, 2015, Western completed its
acquisition of Black Range Minerals Limited Black Range ). Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission Commission rules, this transaction triggered the Company being deemed a United States domestic issuer and losing its foreign private issuer exemption.
On April 29, 2016, the Company filed a Form 10 registration statement with the Commission after converting its basis of accounting from
International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S.
GAAP ). On June 28, 2016, the Company s registration statement became effective and Western became a United States reporting
issuer. 

On June 30, 2023, Western re-qualified as a foreign
private issuer as that term is defined in Rule 3b-4(c) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).
As a result, the Company may now utilize certain accommodations made to foreign private issuers, including (1) an exemption from complying
with the Commission s proxy rules, (2) an exemption from the Company s insiders having to comply with the reporting and short-swing
trading liability provisions of Section 16 under the Exchange Act, (3) the ability to make periodic filings with the Commission on the
Form 20-F and Form 6-K foreign issuer forms, and (4) the ability to offer and sell unrestricted securities outside of the United States
pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S. The Company intends to take advantage of these accommodations. However, the Company currently has
decided to voluntarily continue to file periodic reports with the Commission using domestic issuer forms including filing annual reports
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. On the subsequent measurement date June 30, 2024, Western
reconfirmed its qualification as a foreign private issuer. 

and , respectively. The Company expects to generate operating losses for the foreseeable
future as it incurs expenses to bring its mineral processing facilities online and further expand mining operations. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and working capital of . 

Since inception, the Company has met its liquidity
requirements principally through the issuance of notes and the sale of its common shares. During the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company received in proceeds from the exercise of its common share warrants. On December 12, 2023, the Company closed
a non-brokered private placement of units at a price of (CAD per unit. The aggregate gross proceeds raised in
the private placement amounted to (CAD and net proceeds amounted to (CAD ). During the year
ended December 31, 2023, the Company received in proceeds from the exercise of its common share warrants. 

The Company s ability to continue its planned
operations and to pay its obligations when they become due is contingent upon the Company obtaining additional financing. Management s
plans include seeking to procure additional funds through debt and equity financing, to secure regulatory approval to fully utilize its
kinetic separation Kinetic Separation technology, and to initiate the processing of ore to generate operating cash flows.

Oil and Gas Lease and Easement 

In 2017, the Company entered into an oil and
gas lease that became effective with respect to minerals and mineral rights owned by the Company on approximately surface acres of
the Company s property in Colorado. As consideration for entering into the lease, the lessee has agreed to pay the Company a royalty
from the lessee s revenue attributed to oil and gas produced, saved, and sold attributable to the net mineral interest. The Company
has also received cash payments from the lessee related to the easement that the Company is recognizing incrementally over the eight
year term of the easement. 

On June 23, 2020, the operator elected to extend
the oil and gas lease easement for three additional years through July 2023. This was done to provide additional time in order to complete
well construction and commence oil and gas production. During 2021, the operator completed a first set of eight (8) wells which commenced
oil and gas production by August 2021. During 2022, the operator completed a second set of eight (8) wells which commenced oil and gas
production by August 2022. All sixteen (16) wells remain in production and monthly royalty payments will be ongoing in perpetuity as
long as oil and/or gas are produced from the pooled unit containing these sixteen (16) wells. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the Company recognized aggregate revenue of and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, the Company recognized aggregate revenue of and , respectively, under these oil and gas lease arrangements. 

Reclamation Liabilities 

The Company s mines are subject to certain
asset retirement obligations, which the Company has recorded as reclamation liabilities. The reclamation liabilities of the United States
mines are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, and estimates of the costs of reclamation are reviewed periodically by the applicable
regulatory authorities. The reclamation liability represents the Company s best estimate of the present value of future reclamation
costs in connection with the mineral properties. In connection with the Company s San Rafael Mine, during the three months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an additional gross and discounted reclamation liability of and , respectively.
The Company determined the gross reclamation liabilities of the mineral properties to be and as of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, respectively. The portion of the reclamation liability related to the Van 4 Mine, which is in reclamation as of
September 30, 2024, and its related restricted cash are included in current liabilities and current assets, respectively, at a value
of . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s internal mining operations team has been performing
the Van 4 Mine reclamation work, and the State of Colorado has not yet reduced the associated reclamation liability amount. The Company
expects to begin incurring the reclamation liability after 2054 for all mines that are not in reclamation and accordingly, has discounted
the gross liabilities over their remaining lives using a discount rate of . The net discounted aggregated values as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. The gross reclamation liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 are secured by financial warranties in the amount of and , respectively.

Topaz Mine Permitting Status 

In November 2020 and December 2020, a coalition
of environmental groups (the Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Mined Land Reclamation Board MLRB seeking partial appeals of prior MLRB decisions, requesting the termination of the Topaz Mine permit. The Company joined with the MLRB
in defense of those decisions. On May 5, 2021, the Plaintiffs in the Topaz Appeal filed an opening brief with the Denver District Court
seeking to overturn the July 22, 2020 and October 21, 2020 MLRB permit hearing decisions on the Topaz Mine permit. The MLRB and the Company
sought a settlement with the Plaintiffs. A settlement was not reached, and the MLRB and the Company submitted answer briefs on August
20, 2021. The Plaintiffs submitted a reply brief on September 10, 2021. On March 1, 2022, the Denver District Court reversed the MLRB s
orders regarding the Topaz Mine and remanded the case back to the MLRB for further proceedings consistent with its order. Subsequently
on March 20, 2023, the MLRB issued a board order for the Company to commence final reclamation, which upon completion will terminate
mining operations at the Topaz Mine. Reclamation commenced immediately at the Topaz Mine and is to be completed within five years by
March 2028. 

The Company has been working toward the completion
of an updated Topaz Mine Plan of Operations Topaz Mine Plan ), which is a separate federal requirement of the U.S. Bureau
of Land Management BLM for the conduct of mining activities on the federal land at the Topaz Mine. This is a prerequisite
to re-permit the Topaz Mine with Colorado s DRMS. In connection with the Topaz Mine Plan, an environmental assessment was prepared
by an outside consultant and submitted to the BLM on June 24, 2024. The BLM issued a letter to the Company on August 2, 2024 advising
that the application for the Topaz Mine Plan had run past the allowed evaluation period and was cancelled. A new federal law called the
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 was enacted that creates a one year time limit for BLM reviews. Under the transitional rules, the Topaz
project was not eligible for an extension due to its duration. However, the project can be resubmitted and be picked-up where it was left
off. The re-scoping process will need to be repeated to start the one year time clock. The Company is making a determination as to the
best means and timing to resubmit its application. 

San Rafael Permitting Status 

The San Rafael Uranium Project, located in Emery County, Utah, is being
developed as the Company's second production facility. During the second quarter 2024, Western submitted a Notice of Intent to the BLM
that was approved for a mineral and groundwater exploration project. During the third quarter of 2024, Utah s Division
of Oil, Gas Mining gave its approval of the exploration permit application and the Company posted a Financial Guarantee
of reclamation costs with the BLM. Following the completion of repairs to access roads, the phase 1 drilling program is set to begin in
2024. Initially, groundwater monitoring wells will be installed at five drilling locations, reaching depths of approximately 1,000 feet.
During the borehole completion process, mineralization will also be assessed and confirmed against historical drill data. This project
will provide the baseline data needed for permitting application submission.

Overview 

General 

Western Uranium Vanadium Corp. Western 
or the Company , formerly Western Uranium Corporation) was incorporated in December 2006 under the Ontario Business Corporations
Act. On November 20, 2014, the Company completed a listing process on the Canadian Securities Exchange CSE ). As part of
that process, the Company acquired 100 of the members' interests of Pinon Ridge Mining LLC PRM ), a Delaware limited liability
company. The transaction constituted a reverse takeover RTO of Western by PRM. Subsequent to obtaining appropriate shareholder
approvals, the Company reconstituted its board of directors and senior management team. Western is a Canadian domestic issuer and Canadian
reporting issuer. 

On August 18, 2014, the Company closed on the
purchase of certain mining properties in Colorado and Utah from Energy Fuels Holding Corp. Assets purchased included both owned and leased
lands in Utah and Colorado, and all represent properties that have been previously mined for uranium to varying degrees in the past. The
acquisition included the purchase of the Sunday Mine Complex. The Sunday Mine Complex is located in western San Miguel County, Colorado.
The complex consists of the following five individual mines: the Sunday mine, the Carnation mine, the Saint Jude mine, the West Sunday
mine and the Topaz Mine. The operation of each of these mines requires a separate permit, and all such permits have been obtained by Western
and are currently valid. In addition, each of the mines has good access to a paved highway, electric power to existing declines, office/storage/shop
and change buildings, and an extensive underground haulage development with several vent shafts complete with exhaust fans. The Sunday
Mine Complex is the Company s core resource property and in July 2021 was assigned Active status when mining operations
were restarted. 

On September 16, 2015, Western completed its acquisition
of Black Range, an Australian company that was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange until the acquisition was completed. The acquisition
terms were pursuant to a definitive Merger Implementation Agreement entered into between Western and Black Range. Pursuant to the agreement,
Western acquired all of the issued shares of Black Range by way of Scheme of Arrangement the Scheme under the Australian
Corporation Act 2001 (Cth) (the Black Range Transaction ), with Black Range shareholders being issued common shares of Western
on a 1 for 750 basis. On August 25, 2015, the Scheme was approved by the shareholders of Black Range, and on September 4, 2015, Black
Range received approval by the Federal Court of Australia. In addition, Western issued options to purchase Western common shares to certain
employees, directors, and consultants. Such stock options were intended to replace Black Range stock options outstanding prior to the
Black Range Transaction on the same 1 for 750 basis. 

19 

Under United States Securities and Exchange Commission Commission rules, the Black Range transaction triggered the Company being deemed a United States domestic issuer and losing
its foreign private issuer exemption. On April 29, 2016, the Company filed a Form 10 registration statement with the Commission after
shifting its basis of accounting from IFRS to U.S. GAAP. On June 28, 2016, the Company s registration statement became effective
and Western became a United States reporting issuer. 

On June 30, 2023, Western re-qualified as a foreign
private issuer as that term is defined in Rule 3b-4(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company may now utilize certain
accommodations made to foreign private issuers, including (1) an exemption from complying with the Commission s proxy rules, (2)
an exemption from the Company s insiders having to comply with the reporting and short-swing trading liability provisions of Section
16 under the Exchange Act, (3) the ability to make periodic filings with the Commission on the Form 20-F and Form 6-K foreign issuer forms,
and (4) the ability to offer and sell unrestricted securities outside of the United States pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S. The Company
plans to take advantage of these accommodations. However, the Company currently has decided to voluntarily continue to file periodic reports
with the Commission using domestic issuer forms including filing annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K. On the subsequent measurement date June 30, 2024, Western reconfirmed its qualification as a foreign private issuer. 

The Company has registered offices at 330 Bay
Street, Suite 1400, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 2S8, and its common shares are listed on the CSE under the symbol WUC 
and are traded on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol WSTRF . Its principal business activity is the acquisition and development
of uranium and vanadium resource properties in the states of Utah and Colorado in the United States of America United States ). 

Recent Developments 

Bullen Property (Weld County) 

In 2017, the Company entered into an oil and gas
lease that became effective with respect to minerals and mineral rights owned by the Company of approximately 160 surface acres of the
Company s property in Colorado. As consideration for entering into the lease, the lessee has agreed to pay the Company a royalty
from the lessee s revenue attributed to oil and gas produced, saved, and sold attributable to the net mineral interest. The Company
has also received cash payments from the lessee related to the easement that the Company is recognizing incrementally over the eight year
term of the easement. 

On June 23, 2020, the operator elected to extend
the oil and gas lease easement for three additional years through July 2023. This was done to provide additional time in order to complete
well construction and commence oil and gas production. During 2021, the operator completed a first set of eight (8) wells which commenced
oil and gas production by August 2021. During 2022, the operator completed a second set of eight (8) wells which commenced oil and gas
production by August 2022. All sixteen (16) wells remain in production and monthly royalty payments will be ongoing in perpetuity as long
as oil and/or gas are produced from the pooled unit containing these sixteen (16) wells. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we recognized aggregate revenue of 52,981 and 89,144, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
we recognized aggregate revenue of 147,035 and 357,908, respectively, under these oil and gas lease arrangements. For the three months
ended September 30, 2024, oil and gas royalties declined due to lower volumes attributable to production decline curves. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the decline in oil and gas royalties was principally attributable to short-term well-pad maintenance
shutdowns of eight (8) wells during the second quarter and lower production volumes attributable to production decline curves. 

Sunday Mine Complex Project Update 

Western continues to ramp up operations to achieve
its annualized production target of 1 million pounds of uranium and 6 million pounds of vanadium. Following the expansion of infrastructure
deeper into the West Sunday Mine, the mining teams commenced driving a drift which is approximately 2,700 feet in distance to the Leonard
 Clark deposit. To date, a total of 573 feet has been developed, including 466 feet of ramp footage. A jumbo drill was deployed to
increase progress. 

The drilling teams continue to define additional
mining areas utilizing underground horizontal drilling. Between January 25th and March 31st, the team drilled a total of 13,153 linear
feet. During the second quarter, the underground horizontal drilling program achieved 12,339 additional linear feet, and in the third
quarter an additional 4,983 linear feet were achieved. 

Also, during the third quarter, the operations
team moved to an area of the Sunday Mine where the last operator ceased production. Existing underground workings were rehabilitated and
utilities were installed in a large stope area close to the former production face. 

At the beginning of 2024, Western expanded the Sunday Mine Complex
mining operations by deploying two alternating mining crews and two alternating drilling teams who operated seven days a week. In early
January, a schedule of alternating weeks with seven workdays per week was implemented for the mining and drilling teams at the Sunday
Mine Complex. By early July, mining operations transitioned back to a four workdays per week schedule to enhance coordination and efficiency
during the summer months. For the next phase of the work program, the mining team is transitioning back to the seven day work schedule
in November 2024. 

20 

The mining team encountered a previously unknown uranium mineral deposit
while drifting to the Leonard Clark deposit. Consequently, the Company has paused the drifting project and the mining team and the
drilling team switched the locations from which they were working. The drilling station was relocated to this newly discovered uranium
deposit in order to facilitate an assessment of its size. As this is a previously unexplored area, this discovery was not unexpected as
our expectation is that we will encounter additional significant mineral deposits. Significant drilling, probing and data collection was
done in this area, and reporting will be completed under the supervision of Western s new geologist, to be hired in the fourth quarter
of 2024. 

San Rafael 

The San Rafael Uranium Project, located in Emery County, Utah, is being
developed as the Company's second production facility. During the second quarter 2024, Western submitted a Notice of Intent to the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management BLM that was approved for a mineral and groundwater exploration project. During
the third quarter of 2024, Utah s Division of Oil, Gas Mining gave its approval of the exploration permit application and
the Company posted a 60,300 Financial Guarantee of reclamation costs with the BLM. Following the completion of repairs to access roads,
the phase 1 drilling program is set to begin in 2024. Initially, groundwater monitoring wells will be installed at five drilling locations,
reaching depths of approximately 1,000 feet. During the borehole completion process, mineralization will also be assessed and confirmed
against historical drill data. This project will provide the baseline data needed for permitting application submission. 

Joint Venture with Rimrock Exploration and
Development Inc. 

Western has entered into a joint venture with
Rimrock Exploration and Development Inc. Rimrock ), a private company which owns two fully permitted, developed, and past
producing uranium mines in Colorado. Western will fund mining operations and initially Rimrock will be the operator. Upon the payment
of the initial contribution, each party will own a 50 interest in the assets of the joint venture. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, 55,643 and 234,192, respectively, in funding was provided to the JV, and this amount has been fully expensed to
mining expenditures. The Company completed its earn-in during the third quarter of 2024, through payment of the initial contribution and
now owns a 50 interest in the assets of the JV. These mines access shallow uranium deposits where mined material is available at depths
of 60 and 120 feet. The joint venture will sell the mined material to Western under terms to be determined. The mines do not have a technical
report but are anticipated to provide marginal production to supplement Western s Sunday Mine Complex production. The next step
in advancing the project is for the Rimrock team to drill in front of their mining stations to establish more mineralized material and
determine future mining areas based upon the trend of the mineral deposit. 

Topaz Mine Permitting Status 

In November 2020 and December 2020, a coalition
of environmental groups (the Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Mined Land Reclamation Board MLRB seeking partial appeals of prior MLRB decisions, requesting the termination of the Topaz Mine permit. The Company joined with the MLRB
in defense of those decisions. On May 5, 2021, the Plaintiffs in the Topaz Appeal filed an opening brief with the Denver District Court
seeking to overturn the July 22, 2020 and October 21, 2020 MLRB permit hearing decisions on the Topaz Mine permit. The MLRB and the Company
sought a settlement with the Plaintiffs. A settlement was not reached, and the MLRB and the Company submitted answer briefs on August
20, 2021. The Plaintiffs submitted a reply brief on September 10, 2021. On March 1, 2022, the Denver District Court reversed the MLRB s
orders regarding the Topaz Mine and remanded the case back to the MLRB for further proceedings consistent with its order. Subsequently
on March 20, 2023, the MLRB issued a board order for the Company to commence final reclamation, which upon completion will terminate mining
operations at the Topaz Mine. Reclamation commenced immediately at the Topaz Mine and is to be completed within five years by March 2028. 

The Company has been working toward the completion of an updated Topaz
Mine Plan of Operations since 2020. This is a separate federal requirement of the Bureau of Land Management BLM for the
conduct of mining activities on the federal land at the Topaz Mine and is a prerequisite to re-permit the Topaz Mine with Colorado s
DRMS. An Environmental Assessment EA was prepared by an outside consultant to the BLM and submitted on June 24, 2024 for
BLM s internal review. On August 2, 2024, the BLM issued a letter advising that the Plan of Operations Environmental Assessment
had been cancelled. A new federal law called the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 was enacted that creates a one year time limit for
BLM reviews. Under the transitional rules, the Topaz project was not eligible for an extension. However, the project can be resubmitted
and be picked up where it left off. The re-scoping process will need to be repeated to start the one year time clock. At this time
the Company has the ability to modify the Plan of Operations or proceed with the version previously submitted. Given this optionality,
the Company is making a determination as to the best way to move forward. 

Energy Fuels Ore Buying Program 

Energy Fuels has announced that it expects to commence an ore buying
program from third-party miners in 2024 to increase its uranium production profile at the White Mesa Mill, currently, the only operational
conventional uranium/vanadium mill in the United States. Western and Energy Fuels have had discussions regarding the delivery of mined
material from the Sunday Mine Complex. The process can move forward once Energy Fuels makes available a final Ore Purchase Agreement with
the program terms. If a mutually beneficial arrangement can be established, Western could pivot its current mining operations to begin
deliveries of mined material in as little as 30 days. 

21 

Utah Mineral Processing Plant 

In January 2023, the Company issued news releases
announcing that it has begun site and facility design and permitting on a property acquired in Green River, Emery County, Utah to build
a state-of-the-art minerals processing plant (the Maverick Minerals Processing Plant ). This facility will be designed to
recover uranium, vanadium and cobalt both from conventional materials mined from Company mines and materials produced by other mining
companies. Selecting and acquiring the processing site has taken over one year to find a location with the road, power and water infrastructure
required. The processing plant will utilize the latest processing technology, including Western s patented Kinetic Separation process.
These technology advancements will result in lower overall capital and processing costs. This processing plant is expected to have a cost
of approximately 75 million. After permitting and construction, the processing of uranium and vanadium materials is expected to commence
in late 2027. The facility will be designed to recover cobalt, a metal essential in battery technology and electric vehicles. Within the
state of Utah, there are numerous occurrences of cobalt which may be economical to mine, if a processing facility were available. 

The development of the Maverick Minerals Processing Plant in Green
River, Utah, has advanced considerably. In the second quarter 2023, the land acquisition was completed and in the third quarter 2023 the
project design and permitting activities commenced with the engagement of a full team of consulting firms, chosen for their expertise
in engineering / mill design, permit preparation, environmental, hydrology, and air quality. Site evaluation work was undertaken and a
preliminary plant and property site plan was compiled for the location of monitor wells, meteorological towers, buildings, processing
circuits, tailings and evaporation ponds, roads/infrastructure and ore storage facilities. At a pre-application permitting meeting in
November 2023, the Company and its consultants met onsite with local officials. During the first nine months of 2024, additional progress
has been made. The baseline data required for submission of the permitting application continues to be collected from the onsite meteorological
towers. A final plant and animal study was completed. This study confirmed the site is clear of endangered plant life that is only observable
during the spring growing season. Additional consulting commitments were made to advance the licensing and development with Precision
Systems Engineering (PSE), a leading engineering, and design consulting firm headquartered in Sandy, Utah. Initially, PSE s target
was to release the preliminary engineering design and cost estimate in June 2024 for a 500 ton per day mill; this timing has been deferred
while Western reassesses its design and strategy now that it has purchased a previously licensed mill site in Colorado (please see Colorado
Mill Site Purchase, below). 

At this stage of development, we are continuing to analyze a range
of scenarios to determine the most advantageous approach. Notably, we are exploring downsizing the mill through the application of Kinetic
Separation. In addition to variable sizing and the application of Kinetic Separation, we intend to retain the modular build approach,
and the potential to utilize multiple facility locations. 

Colorado Mill Site Purchase 

On October 1, 2024, Western, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Western
Uranium Corporation, executed a binding Stock Purchase Agreement (the PRC Agreement to purchase 100 of the shares of Pinon
Ridge Corporation, a Colorado corporation PRC ), from a private investor group and thereby acquire Pinion Ridge Resources
Corporation PRRC ), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of PRC. PRRC owns an approximately 900-acre property located in Montrose
County, Colorado, where a uranium processing mill was previously licensed but never constructed. While the mill was never constructed,
it was fully licensed and thus provides leverage from past expenditures unique to this specific site supporting the permitting process.
The acquisition becomes the second property package, that Western has acquired in addition to the Maverick Minerals Processing Plant site
in Utah, and is part of Western s plans for developing and licensing one or more uranium and vanadium processing facilities to process
production from its resource properties in Colorado and Utah. 

Pursuant to the PRC Agreement, the former PRC
shareholders were paid 829,167 for their PRC equity and shareholder loan repayments. As of October 3, 2024, Western has completed all
such payments and the transaction has closed. After closing, a creditor holding a security interest against PRRC was paid a total of 1,148,125
to pay off an outstanding promissory note. Western also assumed certain PRC liabilities and obligations in the transaction, including
royalty obligations payable to an unrelated third party based upon the mineral volume processed through any mineral processing plant that
is located on the property. 

The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase
of an asset. 

George Glasier, the President, CEO and a director
of Western, and his wife Kathleen owned 50 of the shares of PRC, and Andrew Wilder, a director of Western, indirectly owned 3 of the
shares of PRC, and so the transaction was considered a related party transaction. The Company s Board of Directors established an
independent committee of the Board comprised of directors who were not considered to have an interest in the transaction, and the independent
committee oversaw the negotiation and approved the entering into the Agreement on behalf of the Company. Of the total cash paid to the
sellers, approximately 414,000 was paid to George Glasier and approximately 24,000 was paid to an affiliate of Andrew Wilder. 

22 

The operations team has moved rapidly to deploy instruments for the
collection of water and air quality data. This baseline testing is being completed to update existing site data as a critical input for
the permitting and licensing application. 

Nuclear Fuel and Uranium Effect from the
Russian Invasion of Ukraine 

The start of the Russia/Ukraine war created extraordinary
volatility in uranium markets during the first half of 2022. At the peak, the spot price was at an 11 year high. Prior to the invasion
on February 24, 2022, uranium spot prices were in the 43 per pound range and rose to slightly over 63 per pound by April 2022; an increase
of approximately 20 per pound. Later in May 2022 and June 2022, the spot price receded to 45 levels, before recovering to the 50 +/-
per pound price level. This price level was maintained for an extended period as the immediate ban/sanctions anticipated by investors
of nuclear fuel and services from Russia couldn t be implemented. 

Equity markets followed the price action of physical
uranium prices in speculation that governments worldwide would sanction and ban nuclear fuel from Russia. This was in recognition of Russia s
dominant position in nuclear fuel services including 38 of world conversion capacity and 46 of world enrichment capacity. The market
position of Rosatom, Russia s national nuclear company, was developed through decades of government subsidies. However, because
of the lack of replacement capacity in the global nuclear fuel cycle, Rosatom has avoided sanctions. 

Because of the Ukraine invasion, new contracts
are largely not being signed with Rosatom, but deliveries under existing contracts continue to be made. Customer dependencies upon the
Russian supply of uranium, conversion and enrichment are being addressed slowly by governments as alternative suppliers are not currently
available. However, a desire to stay away from bad actors and the threat of Russia weaponizing energy exports or a Russian embargo has
elicited responses. Worldwide, utilities have accelerated their contracting of non-Russian conversion and enrichment services. New uranium
supply agreements are being signed with western producers. In the United States, multiple new nuclear funding programs have already been
put in place and the language from the Department of Energy has only gotten stronger. The Secretary of Energy recently declared: The
United States wants to be able to source its own fuel from ourselves and that s why we are developing a uranium strategy. 

In January 2023, ban and sanction discussions
intensified as Rosatom was shown to have become an active participant in the Ukraine war. An article entitled Russia s nuclear
entity aids war effort, leading to calls for sanctions was published by the Washington Post. Obtained documents show that the Rosatom
state nuclear power conglomerate was supplying the Russian military with components, technology, and raw materials for missile
fuel to be used in the Ukraine war. 

There has been significant legislative progress
favorable to increasing domestic uranium and nuclear fuel production in the United States. The U.S. Senate established a Nuclear Fuel
Security Program in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This amendment requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a Nuclear
Fuel Security Program, expand the American Assured Fuel Supply Program, establish a High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) for Advanced
Nuclear Reactor Demonstration Projects Program, submit a report on a civil nuclear credit program, and to enhance programs to build workforce
capacity to meet mission critical needs of the Department of Energy (DOE). In advance of the United States putting in place a ban or sanctions
on Russian uranium, the DOE continues to make preparations for a Russian counter-sanction terminating the flow of nuclear fuel and services
from Russia. 

UNITED STATES BAN OF RUSSIAN URANIUM: 
In response to Russia s war in Ukraine, the United States legislature passed the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act (H.R. 1042)
to ban Russian uranium imports into the U.S. Unanimous passage of The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act (H.R. 1042) in April 2024
by the U.S. Senate followed the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of the bill in December 2023. Subsequently, on May 13, 2024, President
Biden signed this legislation into law. The ban will now go into effect 90 days after its enactment and will be phased in under Department
of Energy conditional waivers before becoming a complete ban on January 1, 2028. Importantly, the enactment of a Russian ban releases
funding to support the American nuclear supply chain. This funding will be deployed by the DOE under a new program called the Low-Enriched
Uranium (LEU) Enrichment Acquisition. A Request for Proposal was disseminated in June, an Industry day was organized in July,
and bids will be due in August. Through nuclear energy diplomacy, Russia s control of the global nuclear fuel supply chain extends
to many countries. However, as the United States has the world s largest civilian nuclear reactor fleet, it has now taken steps
to reduce its reliance on state-sponsored Russian nuclear fuel. As of August 11, 2024, the Russian uranium ban has become effective and
a waiver is required for U.S. parties to receive Russian uranium until January 1, 2028 when Russian material is fully banned. 

RUSSIAN RESPONSE TO URANIUM BAN: 
On May 14, 2024, the day following the ban enactment, Bloomberg reported that Russia had responded with TENEX issuing force majeure notices
to U.S. utility customers. TENEX is the subsidiary of Rosatom, the state nuclear energy corporation, and the entity through which U.S.
counterparties contract for Russian uranium product imports into the United States. 

23 

The TENEX force majeure notices require U.S. customers to secure waivers
within 60 days that exempt them from the new U.S. Russian uranium ban or risk being moved to the back of the line for uranium deliveries
if they are granted a waiver later. TENEX s notice is based on their intention to honor their contracts, but they acknowledge this
could be overridden by the Kremlin. This deadline has now passed and the DOE is currently granting waivers to the ban. Multiple waivers
have been partially or fully approved, however the details are not in the public domain. The waiver process does not appear restrictive
and will likely allow the majority of previously contracted Russian material into the United States prior to January 1, 2028. Western
is unaware of TENEX taking any further actions subsequent to its force majeure notices. 

On May 21, 2024, the DOE published their process
and instructions for requesting a waiver. The waiver process does not appear restrictive and will likely allow most of the previously
contracted Russian material into the United States prior to January 1, 2028. The U.S. legislative intentions were to deprive Russia of
the revenue associated with U.S. purchases of Russian nuclear fuel and counter Russia s control of the global nuclear fuel cycle
by flooding U.S. and international markets with state-supported Russian uranium and services. 

We continue to believe the shift away from Russia/Rosatom will be a
major catalyst in the realignment of nuclear fuel markets which will benefit western producers. We anticipate this process will culminate
in tremendous support for the U.S. nuclear fuel industry. As a result, we have been and will be continuing to accelerate the advancement
of our operational strategy in anticipation of increasing uranium price levels that will reward near-term scaled-up production. 

Nuclear Fuel and Uranium Market Conditions 

During the first nine months of 2024, the spot uranium price decreased
 9.00 from 91.00 to 82.00. Notably, the long-term price increased from 68.00 to 81.50 during a period of rising conversion and enrichment
services prices. However this follows an extremely strong period in the market where spot uranium prices have reacted to supply/demand
constraints and geopolitical risks. Since July 2023, spot uranium increased from the approximately 50/lbs. level to over 100/lbs. in
January 2024, before settling back into its current levels. The events of 2022 have set in motion uranium market and nuclear fuel opportunities
for the next decade and beyond. There are positive catalysts across multiple levels of the nuclear fuel and uranium markets. Underlying
fundamentals are the strongest in decades. This is attributable to multiple factors, including climate change, energy security, supply
chain and energy scarcity initiatives. The supply/demand imbalance has flipped from a market with excess supply into a market with excess
future demand. With the reduced availability of secondary supplies, utilities have begun adding multi-year contracts with mining companies
for primary supply. The drivers expanding the demand for nuclear fuel include non-nuclear nations adding nuclear power generation, nuclear
nations expanding fleets and/or extending lives of existing reactors, idled nuclear reactors being redeployed, the reversal of phase-outs
and shutdowns, and the deployment of advanced reactors / SMRs. However, the challenge is in meeting increasing demand simultaneously with
supply constraints from the world s largest suppliers. We believe uranium equity prices will continue to strengthen and reflect
the underlying positive fundamentals in the nuclear/uranium sector. Most notably during the quarter, multiple market analysts have flagged
low availability of mobile secondary inventories. We believe the continued draw down of inventories to be a market catalyst of the recent
uptick in uranium prices. 

Positive nuclear energy news has continued to
highlight the global growth of future nuclear electricity generation which will drive increased nuclear fuel demand. In terms of future
supply, utility contracting has continued into 2024, and some uranium mining companies are moving toward restarting production. However,
due to the lead time needed for future uranium production, we are entering a phase where the supply-demand fundamentals are in a deep
multi-year structural supply deficit. The future is not clear as we believe some miners with available near-term production are waiting
for higher price levels and/or project funding before making full start-up commitments. Utilities are also deferring contracting to understand
how regulations and geopolitics will modify their future access to Russian uranium, conversion and enrichment services. 

In the second quarter of 2024, investors began purchasing nuclear and
uranium equities as a means to create long exposure for their positive view on Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to the vast energy requirements
of data centers. Recent transactions have been announced as tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have sought deals to source nuclear
power for their data centers from full scale reactors and SMRs. Microsoft most prominently signed an agreement with Constellation Energy
to restart a Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania and purchase 100 of the power generated for two decades. 

Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Concentration
Risks 

Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing
global energy crisis has focused attention on security of supply and supply chain risks. This has caused most of the world to re-evaluate
their dependence upon nuclear fuel exported by Russia. In spite of the dominant market position of Rosatom, future deliveries potentially
could be at risk due to sanctions, legislation, or a Russian embargo. Customer dependence upon the Russian supply of uranium, conversion
and enrichment are being addressed slowly by governments as alternative suppliers are not currently available. Both Urenco and Orano have
announced that they will invest to expand their uranium enrichment capacity respectively in the United States and France, which represents
a shift away from Russia. Utilities are demonstrating their desire for increased security of their nuclear fuel supply chains. Kazakhstan
is also a concern because the world s largest uranium producing country has an unguarded and the second longest continuous land
border in the world shared with Russia. The potential exists for Russia to exert influence over Kazakhstan. Additionally, Kazatomprom
has put large long-term contracts in place with China. This supply is needed for China to fulfill its 15 year plan to deploy 150 new nuclear
reactors. China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC) has recently opened a uranium trading hub /warehouse facility, on the China / Kazakhstan
border, with the capacity to store 60 million pounds of uranium. It has become evident that the nuclear fuel supply chain has become increasingly
concentrated and interconnected in this very small area of the world. Expanding Kazakhstan uranium exports to Russia and China significantly
reduces future supply for Western nuclear fuel buyers. 

24 

In late July 2023, soldiers of Niger s presidential
guard deposed from power President Mohamed Bazoum; and replaced him with a military junta. This is significant because the new government
is opposed to Western interests and has escalated anti-French rhetoric, while seeking support from Russia and its mercenary group. Uranium
is Niger s main export and this small West African country holds the 7th largest uranium resource in the world and was producing
about 5 of global production. The Junta has initiated multiple actions that are counter to French interests, which include Orano, the
French state-backed nuclear energy company. Most importantly, Niger s Junta has threatened the export of uranium to France which
has serious implications because France acquires 20 of its natural uranium from Niger. Subsequently, French President Macron has visited
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, both former Soviet Republics, citing the vast potential for further cooperation in regard to nuclear power. 

Military alliances are changing as the Junta has signed a new military
agreement with Russia and has brought Russian military instructors into the country in April 2024. In addition to the French military
evacuating/being expelled from Niger, the U.S. military has agreed to depart the country. During May 2024 in a joint statement, Niger
and the U.S. announced that no later than September 2024 all U.S. military troops would be withdrawn from Niger. Under pressure from the
government of Niger, the U.S. completed the final withdrawal of all military personnel on August 5, 2024. The Junta is now utilizing Russian
military support as a replacement. 

This conflict is impacting future global uranium supply. Several uranium
mine development projects in the country continue to proceed despite the evacuation of many foreign nationals and difficulties receiving
supplies. Re-establishing political stability is likely a prerequisite to these companies receiving the funding packages needed to cover
the significant project development costs. Recently, the government of Niger has revoked operating permits from foreign uranium companies,
including Orano in June 2024 and Goviex in July 2024. Subsequently in October 2024, Orano suspended production at its last operating mine
in Niger. This was due to the financial strain from a border closing, which has stranded stockpiled uranium. Further, the government is
not responding to proposed export alternatives. 

During October 2023, geopolitical instabilities spread further to the
Middle East after a Hamas attack on Israel triggered a counterattack by Israel on the Gaza Strip. The Israel-Hamas hostilities have escalated
over the Summer of 2024 and then spread to other countries in the Middle East. This additional hot spot further increases volatility in
the world and destabilizes the Middle East region that is highly influential on global energy prices. 

United States Presidential Election 

On November 5, 2024, the United States held a highly contested Presidential
election between Republicans (Trump-Vance) and Democrats (Harris-Walz). The Trump-Vance Republican ticket won, thus returning former-President
Donald Trump to a second Presidential term. Also, Republicans appear to have assumed control of Congress by achieving majorities in both
the Senate and House of Representatives. Nuclear energy currently enjoys bipartisan support, but each of these Presidential Administrations
has taken a different approach in their support. Given the Republican wins in these elections, this is likely to lead to changes in the
approach to various issues that could affect the Company s business but can t be predicted with any certainty. However, based upon available information, we speculate that Biden-Harris climate change and clean energy initiatives will be de-emphasized
in favor of Trump administration campaign themes involving energy independence and America first policies.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Summary: 

Our condensed consolidated net loss for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,241,170 and 1,060,042, respectively. The principal components of these year over year
changes are discussed below. 

Our comprehensive loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,227,152 and 1,103,516, respectively. 

Revenues 

Our revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 52,981 and 89,144, respectively. The decrease in revenues of 36,163, or 41 was primarily related to lower oil
and gas well volumes attributable to production decline curves during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Mining Expenditures 

Mining expenditures for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 were 1,166,343 as compared to 730,854 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in mining expenditures
of 435,489, or 60 was principally attributable to scaling up mining activities at the Company s Sunday Mine Complex which involved
the hiring of additional mining personnel, increased mining services and supplies costs, and increased maintenance and depreciation costs
for mining equipment and vehicles placed into service. 

Professional Fees 

Professional fees for the three months ended September
30, 2024 were 127,049 as compared to 44,382 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in professional fees of 82,667,
or 186 was due to increased accounting and legal costs in connection with increased business and mining activities. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 813,403 as compared to 365,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general
and administrative expense of 448,206, or 123 , is primarily due to an increase in headcount and employee benefits, non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and insurance costs in connection with increased mining activities. 

26 

Consulting fees 

Consulting fees for the three months ended September
30, 2024 were 247,850 as compared to 48,251 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consulting fees of 199,599
was due to the increased costs incurred for the licensing and permitting of a mineral processing plant. 

Accretion and interest income, net 

Accretion and interest income, net for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was 62,492 as compared to 39,498 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest
income, net of 22,994 or 58 was principally attributable to higher interest rates earned and larger invested cash balances during the
three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other income, net 

Other income, net for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 1,998 as compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was attributable to a loss on the sale
of a used vehicle during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Foreign currency translation adjustment 	 

Foreign currency translation adjustment for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 14,018 as compared to a loss of 43,474 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The change in foreign exchange is primarily due to the strengthening of the USD against the CAD. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Summary: 

Our condensed consolidated net loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7,343,580 and 3,240,232, respectively. The principal components of these year over year
changes are discussed below. 

Our comprehensive loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7,534,441 and 3,225,516, respectively. 

Revenues 

Our revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 147,035 and 357,908, respectively. The decrease in revenues of 210,873, or 59 was primarily related to lower
production volumes from the oil and gas wells due to short-term well-pad maintenance shutdown in the second quarter and lower well performance
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Mining Expenditures 

Mining expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were
 3,860,173 as compared to 1,992,503 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in mining expenditures of 1,867,670,
or 94 was principally attributable to scaling up mining activities at the Company s Sunday Mine Complex, which involved the hiring
of additional mining personnel, increased mining services and supplies costs, and increased maintenance and depreciation costs for mining
equipment and vehicles placed into service. 

Professional Fees 

Professional fees for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 were 484,926 as compared to 303,312 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in professional fees of 181,614,
or 60 was due to increased accounting and legal costs in connection with increased business and mining activities. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,604,516 as compared to 1,384,316 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in
general and administrative expense of 1,220,200, or 88 is primarily due to an increase in headcount and employee benefits, non-cash
stock-based compensation expense and insurance costs in connection with increased mining activities. 

27 

Consulting fees 

Consulting fees for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 were 738,204 as compared to 48,988 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in consulting fees of 689,216
was due to the increased costs incurred for the licensing and permitting of a mineral processing plant. 

Accretion and interest income, net 

Accretion and interest income, net for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was 199,202 as compared to 126,979 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest
income, net of 72,223, or 57 was principally attributable to higher interest rates earned and larger invested cash balances during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other income, net 

Other income, net for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was a loss of 1,998 as compared to a gain of 4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was principally
attributable to a gain on the sale of a used vehicles during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a loss on the sale of
a used vehicle during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Foreign currency translation adjustment 	 

Foreign currency translation adjustment for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 190,861 as compared to a gain of 14,716 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The change in foreign exchange is primarily due to the weakening of the USD against the CAD. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
balance as of September 30, 2024 was 7,459,395. Our cash position is highly dependent on our ability to raise capital through the issuance
of debt and equity and our management of expenditures for mining development and for fulfillment of our public company reporting responsibilities.
Our management believes that in order to finance the development of the mining properties and Kinetic Separation, to secure regulatory
licenses and to construct the Maverick Minerals Processing Plant for the processing of uranium and vanadium, we will be required to raise
additional capital by way of debt and/or equity. We will also require additional working capital to continue to scale-up its mining operations
at the Sunday Mine Complex. This outlook is based on our current financial position and is subject to change if opportunities become available
based on current exploration program results and/or external opportunities. 

Net cash used in operating activities 	 

Net cash used in operating activities was 5,762,812
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 2,563,287 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of
 3,199,525 in cash used in operating activities was principally driven by an increase in net loss of 4,103,348, offset by an increase
of 542,788 in stock-based compensation and an increase of 269,925 in depreciation. 

Net cash used in investing activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 1,178,935
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1,874,183 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in
cash used in investing activities of 695,248 was principally due to elevated purchases of equipment in the 2023 period in connection
initial mining mobilization related to the Sunday Mine Complex. 

Net cash provided by financing activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4,605,458 and 551,629, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing
activities of 4,053,829 was due to proceeds of 4,605,458 from the exercise of warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

28 

Reclamation Liability 

Our mines are subject to certain asset retirement
obligations, which we have recorded as reclamation liabilities. The reclamation liabilities of the United States mines are subject to
legal and regulatory requirements, and estimates of the costs of reclamation are reviewed periodically by the applicable regulatory authorities.
The reclamation liability represents our best estimate of the present value of future reclamation costs in connection with the mineral
properties. In connection with our San Rafael Mine, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred an additional gross
and discounted reclamation liability of 61,403 and 12,154, respectively. We determined the gross reclamation liabilities of the mineral
properties to be 812,027 and 751,444, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The portion of the reclamation liability
related to the Van 4 Mine, which is in reclamation as of September 30, 2024, and its related restricted cash are included in current liabilities
and current assets, respectively, at a value of 75,075. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our internal mining operations
team has been performing the Van 4 Mine reclamation work, and the State of Colorado has not yet reduced the reclamation liability amount.
We expect to begin incurring the reclamation liability after 2054 for all mines that are not in reclamation and accordingly, have discounted
the gross liabilities over their remaining lives using a discount rate of 5.4 . The net discounted aggregated values as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023 were 262,880 and 241,562, respectively. The gross reclamation liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023 are secured by financial warranties in the amount of 812,027 and 751,444, respectively. 

Oil and Gas Lease and Easement 

We entered into an oil and gas lease that became
effective with respect to minerals and mineral rights owned by us on approximately 160 surface acres of our property in Colorado. As consideration
for entering into the lease, the lessee has agreed to pay us a royalty from the lessee s revenue attributed to oil and gas produced,
saved, and sold attributable to the net mineral interest. We have also received cash payments from the lessee related to the easement
that we are recognizing incrementally over the eight year term of the easement. 

On June 23, 2020, the same entity as discussed
above elected to extend the oil and gas lease easement for three additional years, commencing on the date the lease would have previously
expired. During 2021, the operator completed a first set of eight (8) wells which commenced oil and gas production by August 2021. During
2022, the operator completed a second set of eight (8) wells which commenced oil and gas production by August 2022. All sixteen (16) wells
remain in production and monthly royalty payments will be ongoing in perpetuity as long as oil and/or gas are produced from the pooled
unit containing these sixteen (16) wells. 

Under the oil and gas lease and easement arrangements,
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized aggregate revenue of 52,981 and 89,144, respectively, and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized aggregate revenue of 147,035 and 357,908, respectively, under
these oil and gas lease arrangements 

Related Party Transactions 

We have transacted with related parties pursuant
to service arrangements in the ordinary course of business, as follows: 

Prior to the acquisition of Black Range, Mr. George
Glasier, the Company s CEO, who is also a director of the Company Seller ), transferred his interest in a former joint
venture with Ablation Technologies, LLC to Black Range. In connection with the transfer, Black Range issued 25 million shares of Black
Range common stock to Seller and committed to pay 346,820 (AUD 500,000) to Seller within 60 days of the first commercial application
of the Kinetic Separation technology. We assumed this contingent payment obligation in connection with the acquisition of Black Range.
At the date of the acquisition of Black Range, this contingent obligation was determined to be probable. Since the deferred contingent
consideration obligation is probable and the amount is estimable, we recorded the deferred contingent consideration as an assumed liability
in the amount of 346,820 and 340,650 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

On October 1, 2024, Western, through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Western Uranium Corporation WUC ), executed a binding Stock Purchase Agreement (the PRC Agreement to purchase 100 of the shares of Pinon Ridge Corporation, a Colorado corporation PRC ), from a private investor group and
thereby acquire an approximately 900-acre property located in Montrose County, Colorado, where a uranium processing plant was previously
licensed but never constructed. George Glasier, the President, CEO and a director of Western, and his wife Kathleen owned 50 of the shares
of PRC, and Andrew Wilder, a director of Western, indirectly owned 3 of the shares of PRC. Therefore, this transaction constitutes a
related party transaction. The Company s Board of Directors established an independent committee of the Board, comprised of directors
who are not considered to have an interest in the transaction. The independent committee of the Board has overseen the negotiation and
approved the entering into the Agreement on behalf of the Corporation. Of the total cash paid to the sellers, approximately 414,000 was
paid to George Glasier and approximately 24,000 was paid to an affiliate of Andrew Wilder. 

We have multiple lease arrangements with Silver
Hawk Ltd., an entity which is owned by George Glasier and his wife Kathleen Glasier. These leases, which are all on a month-to-month basis,
are for the rental of office, workshop, warehouse and employee housing facilities. We incurred rent expense of 26,325 and 17,925 in
connection with these arrangements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred rent expense of 76,175
and 53,775 in connection with these arrangements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

29 

We are obligated to pay Mr. Glasier for reimbursable
expenses in the amount of 23,832 and 50,010, included within accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the Company purchased approximately 9,000 and 25,800 of mining related equipment from Silver Hawk Ltd, respectively. 

Going Concern 

With the exception of the quarter ended June 30,
2022, we had incurred losses from our operations and as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of 26,161,437 and working capital
of 6,174,805. 

Since inception, we have met our liquidity requirements
principally through the issuance of notes, the sale of our common shares and from limited revenue sources. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we received 4,605,458 in proceeds from the exercise of our common share warrants. On December 12, 2023, we closed
a non-brokered private placement of 5,215,828 units at a price of CAD 1.39 per unit. The aggregate gross proceeds raised in the private
placement amounted to CAD 7,250,000 (USD 4,836,867 in net proceeds). During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received 1,004,044
in proceeds from the exercise of our common share warrants. 

Our ability to continue our operations and to
pay our obligations when they become due is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing. Management s plans include seeking
to procure additional funds through debt and equity financings, to secure regulatory approval licenses to fully utilize our Kinetic Separation,
to construct Maverick Minerals Processing Plant for the processing of uranium and vanadium and to incorporate Kinetic Separation in the
processing uranium and vanadium bearing materials to generate operating cash flows. We will need additional capital to continue ongoing
mining operations by our in-house mining team at the Sunday Mine Complex while simultaneously permitting and constructing a processing
plant. 

There are no assurances that we will be able to
raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that cash flows generated from its operations will be sufficient to meet our current
operating costs and required debt service. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to
reduce the scope of our planned product development, which could harm our financial condition and operating results, or we may not be
able to continue to fund our ongoing operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
to sustain operations for at least one year from the issuance of the accompanying financial statements. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance
sheet transactions. We have not entered into any specialized financial agreements to minimize our investment risk, currency risk or commodity
risk. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The preparation of these condensed interim consolidated
financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. 

Significant assumptions about the future and other
sources of estimation uncertainty that management has made at the end of the reporting period, that could result in a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, in the event that actual results differ from assumptions made, include, but are not
limited to, the following: fair value of transactions involving common shares, assessment of the useful life and evaluation for impairment
of intangible assets, valuation and impairment assessments on mineral properties, deferred contingent consideration, the reclamation liability,
valuation of stock-based compensation and valuation of long-term debt, HST and asset retirement obligations. Other areas requiring estimates
include allocations of expenditures, depletion and amortization of mineral rights and properties.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective, due to our identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

Based upon its assessment, as of September 30,
2024, management has identified the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, inclusive of the control
weakness related to disclosure controls and procedures: 

1. 
 The lack of sufficient dedicated accounting personnel, resulting in delays around the timely collection of inputs and the preparation and review of financial reporting, as well as the inability to provide for effective segregation of duties, and 

2. 
 The lack of formal documentation of the design of the control environment and the related control processes and procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a- 15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act that occurred during the Company s third fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

31 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In the opinion of management, we are not involved
in any claims, legal actions or regulatory proceedings as of September 30, 2024, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material
adverse effect on our condensed interim consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including
in Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
the heading Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in Item 2, the risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects that we believe are most important for you to consider
are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023
filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are not
the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also
impair our business operations. There are no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

None 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

For Western, safety is a core value, and we strive
for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production,
addresses topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation, and program
auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the
cornerstone of safety at Western, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace
accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both regulators and the industry to
improve mine safety. 

The operation of our U.S. based mine is subject
to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of
1977 (the Mine Act ). MSHA inspects our mine on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes
a violation has occurred under the Mine Act Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly
increased the number of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has
also increased in recent years. 

Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ), issuers that are operators, or that have a
subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States, and that is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety
and Health Administration under the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 Mine Safety Act ), are required to disclose in their
periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments
and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. Western went into active mining operations at the Sunday Mine Complex during 2021. During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspections have not yielded any disclosures required
by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE EXHIBIT

Exhibit 95 

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 

The following disclosures are provided
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which
require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that
operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). 

Mine Safety Information. Whenever
the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard
or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining
operator (e.g. our subsidiaries, Black Range Minerals Limited and Pinon Ridge Mining, LLC) must abate the alleged violation. In some situations,
such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine
affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil
penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and
appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations,
orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s)
assigned. In addition to civil penalties, the Mine Act also provides for criminal penalties for an operator who willfully violates a health
or safety standard or knowingly violates or fails or refuses to comply with an order issued under Section 107(a) or any final decision
issued under the Act . 

The below table reflects citations and orders issued to
us by MSHA during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Additional information about the Act and MSHA references
used in the table follows. 

Section
104(a) Significant and Substantial S S Citations: Citations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine
Act for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect
of a mine safety or health hazard. 

Section
104(b) Orders : Orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section
104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected
by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 

Section
104(d) S S Citations and Orders : Citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure
to comply with mandatory, significant and substantial health or safety standards. 

Section
110(b)(2) Violations : Flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 

Section
107(a) Orders : Orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent
danger (as defined by MSHA) existed.

TOTAL 

(1) The definition of a mine under
section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting
minerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools, and minerals preparation facilities. Unless otherwise indicated,
any of these other items associated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine. MSHA assigns an identification
number to each mine and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities such as preparation facilities. We
are providing the information in the table by mine rather than MSHA identification number because that is how we manage and operate our
mining business and we believe this presentation will be more useful to investors than providing information based on MSHA identification
numbers. 

Pattern
or Potential Pattern of Violations . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, none of the mines operated by us received written
notice from MSHA of (a) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly
and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act or (b) the
potential to have such a pattern. 

Pending Legal Actions . As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had no pending legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission ),
an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act,
and no such legal actions were instituted or resolved during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
