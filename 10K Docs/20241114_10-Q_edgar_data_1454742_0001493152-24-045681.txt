FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words
such as expects, plans, will, forecasts, projects, intends, 
 estimates, and other words of similar meaning. One can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical
or current facts. These statements are likely to address our growth strategy, financial results and product and development programs.
One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from our
forward looking statements. These factors may include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including
some that are known and some that are not. No forward looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. 

These
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include, and are not limited to: 

our
 growth strategies; 

our
 anticipated future operations and profitability; 

our
 future financing capabilities and anticipated need for working capital; 

the
 anticipated trends in our industry; 

acquisitions
 of other companies or assets that we might undertake in the future; and 

current
 and future competition. 

In
addition, factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, as well as those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. We undertake no obligation
to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these
risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to

these financial statements. 

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and the classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Cautionary
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements, as that term is used in
federal securities laws, about Good Gaming, Inc. GMER, we, our, us, the Company, 
 management and its financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements include, among others: 

statements
 concerning the potential benefits that we may experience from our business activities and certain transactions we contemplate or
 have completed; and 

statements
 of GMER s expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical
 facts. These statements may be made expressly in this Form 10-Q. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such
 as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, opines, or similar
 expressions used in this Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties
 that may cause GMER s actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by GMER in those
 statements. The most important facts that could prevent GMER from achieving its stated goals include, but are not limited to, the
 following: 

(a) 
 volatility
 or decline of our stock price; 

(b) 
 potential
 fluctuation of quarterly results; 

(c) 
 failure
 of GMER to achieve revenues or profits; 

(d) 
 inadequate
 capital to continue or expand our business, and inability to raise additional capital or financing to implement our business plans; 

(e) 
 decline
 in demand for GMER s products and services; 

(f) 
 rapid
 adverse changes in markets; 

(g) 
 litigation
 with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties against us, including but not limited to challenges to our intellectual property
 rights; and 

(h) 
 insufficient
 revenues to cover operating costs. 

There
is no assurance that GMER will be profitable, able to successfully develop, manage or market its products and services, be able to attract
or retain qualified executives and personnel, able to obtain customers for its products or services, additional dilution in outstanding
stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, the exercise of outstanding warrants
and stock options, or the conversion of convertible promissory notes, and other risks inherent in GMER s businesses. 

Because
the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. GMER cautions you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. The cautionary
statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking
statements that GMER or persons acting on its behalf may issue. GMER does not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts 
expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of this Form 10-Q, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Overview

pre-installing them on devices sold by mobile service providers. 

In
2022, the Company entered the Roblox gaming space by developing experiences with its platform. As the year concluded, the
Company launched Roblox adaptations of well-received Minecraft titles, namely Treasure Island, incorporating the unique
elements of MicroBuddies , a previously launched crypto game. The strategic release allowed the Company to collect
valuable player feedback, aiding in the ongoing refinement of both titles features and functionality. 

Furthermore,
the Company had embarked on a robust development schedule, unveiling beta versions of its SCBB franchise on both the Minecraft 
PC platform and Roblox, a Prison variant for Minecraft PC, and various Microbuddies-themed games on the Roblox platform. 

However,
the Company encountered substantial challenges related to developers, leading to missed updates, development complexities, and postponed
product launches. Consequently, the Company decided to temporarily halt Roblox and Minecraft development to conduct comprehensive reviews
of platforms, developers, and marketing efforts. These evaluations aimed to identify and address pain points in processes, paving the
way for realistic expectations and enhanced gaming experiences that align with both the Company s and customers expectations,
ultimately contributing to improved financial performance and shareholder value. 

In
response to these challenges, the Company initiated an in-depth business development research project, exploring opportunities in the
mobile gaming industry. Following the review, the Company forged a multi-year strategic partnership with ViaOne Services Inc. to distribute
Good Gaming mobile games to the Assist Wireless and enTouch Wireless customer bases. Simultaneously, the Company planned to
release its new mobile gaming experiences on popular platforms like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 

A
significant development partnership with Arcadia Studios, a division of the Coeus Group of Companies, was also announced. Coeus Solutions,
a leading German software development group, collaborated with the Company in this endeavor. The first mobile game resulting from this
partnership, titled Galactic Acres, launched on February 16, 2024. 

On
April 19, 2024, the Board of Directors of Good Gaming, Inc. accepted the resignation of Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer Mr. Domenic Fontana. Mr. Fontana s resignation was not the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Company or the
Company s Board of Directors on any matter relating to the operations, policies, or practices of the Company. 

Simultaneously,
on April 19, 2024, John D. JD Hilzendager was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Hilzendager in his
role as Chief Financial Officer will report to David Dorwart, the Company s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hilzendager has been designated
as the Company s Principal Accounting Officer. 

The
terms of Mr. Hilzendager s employment will be covered under the Second Amendment to the Amended Employee Services Agreement Dated
January 14, 2022, with ViaOne Services, LLC. 

In
June 2024, the Company eliminated the positions of Chief Operating Officer, Gaming Director, and Operations Manager. In July 2024, the
Company also sold all assets related to MicroBuddies , all owned Minecraft Servers, and Roblox because those assets failed to generate
revenue and were not actively maintained by the Company. This asset sale formally exited the Company from the blockchain, Minecraft,
and Roblox gaming spaces. 

To
broaden its mobile game distribution, the company is actively seeking to establish new partnerships with telecommunications providers,
device manufacturers, and game publishers. 

Technology 

Expanding
its development portfolio in 2022, the Company ventured into the Roblox gaming platform, releasing Roblox versions of popular Minecraft
titles. Development partnerships with Meraki Studios and multiple releases were completed in 2023, featuring updates to the Minecraft
1.19 software version. 

In
2024, the Company entered the mobile gaming market, focusing on creating character and story-driven experiences. In Q1 2024, the Company
launched a new intellectual property on mobile called Galactic Acres . In Q2, the Company began preparing the game
for pre-installation in mobile devices. In Q2 Galactic Acres saw more than 10,000 downloads. 

In
Q3 2024, the Company sold all assets and proprietary technology related to MicroBuddies , all owned Minecraft Servers, and Roblox
because those assets failed to generate revenue and were not actively maintained by the Company. They were sold for 12,500, when offset
by their carrying value resulted in a gain of 12,253.

Business
Strategy 

In
the past, our management team s business strategy was to be a full-service company providing best-in-class Esports gaming tournaments
and Minecraft experiences. With the onset of the pandemic, the Esports industry has suffered a considerable amount of lost business opportunities.
We were not immune to the effects of the pandemic on our Esports business. In addition, the size of the PC-based Minecraft gaming community
has shrunk considerably. We have taken a hard look at both the Esports and Minecraft business verticals and determined that both strategies
are no longer in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. We feel that neither the Esports nor Minecraft verticals will
have a significant upside in the future. As such, the Esports and Minecraft business verticals will not comprise a meaningful segment
of our ongoing business strategy. We will not designate any future investment in either of these verticals for the foreseeable future. 

With
the rise in the popularity of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, the Company had decided to invest in the creation of its new
game, MicroBuddies , which combines Ethereum ERC721 NFTs (Non-fungible tokens), non-standard ERC20 tokens (GOO ),
and strategic, long-tail web browser gameplay to replicate and create unique and collectible NFTs. ERC20 GOO tokens
are limited to use as in-game currency only. This strategy enabled us to enter the emerging NFT and blockchain gaming space. Initial
revenues from MicroBuddies came from selling Nano Factory Tokens used to synthesize generation 0 of MicroBuddies . 
Ongoing MicroBuddies revenues were generated from a 5 royalty on all sales of MicroBuddy NFTs
in third-party marketplaces and a 0.01 MATIC per MicroBuddy replication. In 2022, we introduced additional initiatives
around the MicroBuddies intellectual property. We expected the ancillary MicroBuddies initiatives
to create consistent, recurring revenue over the life of the project. However, due to fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets and the
slow adoption of blockchain games, revenues underperformed, and we did not pursue additional opportunities with MicroBuddies . 

In
2023, the Company encountered significant challenges related to Roblox and Minecraft game development and publishing initiative,
including developer issues, publishing delays due to platform integrations and functionality, and marketing strategy lapses. Consequently,
the Company has decided to halt Roblox and Minecraft development until publishing to both platforms makes sense. The Company sold these
assets for 12,500 to Despawn, LLC in July of 2024 and officially exited all operations related to Blockchain/Crypto gaming, Minecraft,
and Roblox. The asset sale included all game code, artwork, rights to use related trademarks, social media channels, and all other intellectual
property related to the games developed on these platforms. 

In
2023, the Company announced a strategic partnership with ViaOne Services Inc. to distribute Good Gaming mobile games to the Assist Wireless 
and enTouch Wireless the Company is committed to building connected mobile gaming experiences. We believe our pivot to mobile game
publishing and pre-loading on mobile phones will lead to ongoing revenue and profit generation. The Company plans to integrate its intellectual
properties into our mobile games in order to continue to build long-lasting awareness across a global audience. 

Our
initial strategic partnership with ViaOne Services allows us to embed our mobile games on thousands of phones per month. Player acquisition
is the most challenging aspect of game publishing. Our partnership with ViaOne Services will produce considerable exposure for game developers
to a new player base and intends to enhance player acquisition efforts significantly. 

The
Company is focused on creating partnerships with other game developers and partners to broker agreements that generate revenue by preloading
their already successful games on ViaOne Services telecommunication company devices. The Company will also look to partner with other
niche mobile telecommunications companies and device manufacturers to expand its footprint. 

Employees 

In
shifting the focus toward pre-loading games, the full-time Chief Operating Officer, Gaming Director, and Operations Manager
positions were eliminated in July 2024 , as were certain other external consultant positions. Pursuant to our Management Services Agreement with
ViaOne Services LLC, certain ViaOne employees are considered consultants of the Company. ViaOne Services will continue day-to-day
operations until it becomes necessary to create additional positions for the Company. 

Offices 

Our
executive offices are at 415 McFarlan Rd, Suite 108, Kennett Square, PA 19501, and our phone number is (844) 419-7445.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. This means that our auditors
believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of
the financial statements unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have generated little revenue although
revenue is anticipated to grow as we have completed the development of our game, Galactic Acres. We anticipate moving into the pre-loading
phase through our partnership with ViaOne Services in the coming months. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations.
Our only other source of cash at this time is investments through our existing agreement with ViaOne Services and the revenue we generate
from our products and services. We must raise cash to continue our project and build our operations. 

Plan
of Operation Milestones 

We
are at an early stage of our new business operations focusing on pre-installing games on mobile devices through our partnership with
ViaOne Services. Over the next twelve months, our primary target milestones include: 

1. 
 Create
 a partnership with a game developer and preinstall a game on thousands of ViaOne Services devices. 

2. 
 Measure
 the results of pre-installing games through a series of controlled tests. Make adjustments as a result of the test. 

3. 
 Seek
 additional game developers and publishers seeking player acquisition through having their game pre-installed on tens of thousands
 of devices. 

Limited
operating history and need for additional capital 

There
is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance relating to our new business
direction. We have generated little revenue. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due
to price and cost increases in services and products.

Operating Revenues 

We
have generated 174 and 506 in revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and 25 and 3,442 in revenue
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which reflects an increase of 149 or 596 and a decrease of 2,936
or 85 , respectively. The increase/decrease in revenue was attributed to the decision to halt marketing in pursuit of pre-loading games
onto mobile devices. 

Operating Expenses and Net Loss 

Operating
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 171,833 and 703,997, respectively, compared with 231,628 and
 736,936, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which reflects a decrease of 59,795 or 26 and 32,939
or 4 , respectively. The decrease in expenses was attributable to reduced contract labor costs associated with the development of Galactic
Acres, reduced legal fees and reduced leased employee services. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 178,269 and 853,317, respectively, compared
with a net loss of 275,547 and 982,741, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects a decrease
of 97,278 or 35 and 129,424 or 13 , respectively. The decrease in net loss was attributed to a decrease in cost of Revenue and professional
fees, offset by an increase in advertising and promotion, administrative and development fees. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash balance consisted of 8,302 compared to cash balance of 304,225 as of December 31, 2023.
The decrease in the cash balance was attributed to the expenses paid for day to day activities and development. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had 125,391 in total assets compared to total assets of 484,394 at September 30, 2023. The decrease in total assets was
attributed to cash paid for daily operations and the impairment cost associated with the digital assets. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liabilities of 917,704 compared with total liabilities of 520,277 as of December 31, 2023.
The increase in liabilities was attributable to the operating expenses to be paid in coming months. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has a working capital deficit of 886,565 compared with a working capital deficit of 122,427 as of
December 30, 2023. The decrease in working capital is due to a decline in cash expended for day to day activity as well as the impairment
cost associated with the digital assets. 

In
Q3 2024, the Company faced challenges in maintaining adequate capital resources due to a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents,
resulting from lower-than-anticipated revenues and higher development costs. Despite efforts to optimize working capital management,
our ability to access additional financing sources has been constrained by current market conditions. Management will utilize its existing
agreement with ViaOne Services for working capital and is actively exploring alternative financing options to address these challenges
and ensure sufficient liquidity for ongoing operations.

Cash
flow from Operating Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 280,007 of cash for operating activities compared to the use of cash in an
amount of 714,067 for operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects a decrease of 434,060 or
61 . The decrease in the use of cash for operating activities was attributed to the company s decrease in advertising and promotions
and management fees. 

Cash
flow from Investing Activities 

The
Company used 22,263 in cash in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1,180 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 21,083 in cash used in investing activities was attributed to the Company s acquisition
of intangible assets. 

Cash
flow from Financing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 6,347 of proceeds from financing activities compared to 6,657 received
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects a decrease of 310. The decrease in proceeds from financing activities
was due to the change in employee stock issued offset by the issuance of shares to a consultant for payment in 2024. 

Going
Concern 

We
have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities.
For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will
be able to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of the financial statements without further financing. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Future
Financings 

We
will continue to rely on equity sales of our preferred shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. 

There
is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our
operations and other activities. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Management s
estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the
 Exchange Act ), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024 covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, such disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective due to the lack of segregation of duties and lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms because of the identification
of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls
and procedures. The material weakness relates to the lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting
and accounting functions were performed by an external consultant with no oversight by a professional with accounting expertise. Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer did not possess accounting expertise and our company does not have an audit committee.
This weakness was due to the Company s lack of working capital to hire additional staff. Subsequently, with the completion of transition
in the management and Board, the financial management will be led by a certified public accountant with extensive accounting experience
who follows the standards of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and internal controls procedures to ensure the faithful representation
of the financial statements, including the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of the reporting entity. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our third quarter of 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal proceedings 

To
our best knowledge, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, are deemed to be material
to our financial condition or results of operations. None of our directors, officers or affiliates is involved in a proceeding adverse
to our business or has a material interest adverse to our business.
