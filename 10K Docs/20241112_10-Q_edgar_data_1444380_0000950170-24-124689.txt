 Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments The Company s money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The Company s short-term investments are comprised of agency bonds, commercial paper, corporate notes and treasury bonds. All short-term investments have been classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because of the sufficient observable inputs for revaluation. The Company s Level 2 investments are valued using third-party pricing sources. The pricing services utilize industry-standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar investments, issuer credit spreads, benchmark investments, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs. Convertible Senior Notes As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the convertible senior notes due (the 2025 Notes) was million and million, respectively. The fair value was determined on the basis of market prices observable for similar instruments and is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (See Note 7 for additional information regarding the 2025 Notes). Warrant Liability In November 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the Braidwell Credit Agreement) with Braidwell LP (together with its affiliates, Braidwell). In connection with the Braidwell Credit Agreement, the Company issued 

 10 

million shares of the Company's common stock. The Braidwell Warrants are valued using the Black Scholes valuation model and are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Braidwell Warrants was million and million, respectively.

The contingent consideration is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the product development and revenue milestones were million and million, respectively.

Pursuant to the second lease amendment, the landlord provided the Company with a tenant improvement allowance of up to million. The amendment increased the right-of-use asset and lease liability by million. The Company entered into a separate non-cancellable facility lease for warehouse space beginning on through , under which it is obligated to pay approximately million in lease payments over the term of the lease. In October 2021, the Company entered into a first amendment of the warehouse lease, which extends the lease term to terminate on and under which the Company is obligated to pay approximately million over the term of the extension period. In , the Company entered into a lease for approximately square feet of space for a manufacturing facility in Costa Rica to begin in and to last through , under which it is obligated to pay approximately million in lease payments over the term of the lease. On the commencement date in April 2021, the Company classified and measured the lease, resulting in the recording of operating assets of million and operating lease liabilities of million.

Supply Agreements The Company has entered into supply agreements with certain suppliers that require certain minimum annual purchase agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had minimum annual purchase commitments of m illion due for the remainder of 2024 an d million due in 2025. In addition, the Company renegotiated a supplier contract resulting in a one-time million fee, recorded in accrued liabilities and expensed to cost of revenue as of June 30, 2024. The Company paid million of such renegotiation fee during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the remaining million is due in 2025. The renegotiation reduced the Company s future purchase commitments enabling the company to accelerate the move of inventory production to its Costa Rica facility. 
 Contingencies From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business activities related to, for example, employment matters and patent issues. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. In July 2023, the Company entered into a stock and note purchase agreement and agreed to purchase million in notes and million in total stock whereby such purchases are contingent upon meeting certain future milestones. As of September 30, 2024, such milestones have not been met. Indemnification The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to the Company s technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the individual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has director and officer insurance coverage that reduces the Company s exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. Legal Matters The Company is and may from time to time continue to be involved in various legal proceedings to defend its intellectual property, including several pending European patent oppositions at the European Patent Office (EPO) initiated by the Company s competitors Medtronic and Boston Scientific. In addition, the Company is and may from time to time also be involved in various legal proceedings, such as employment matters, product liability matters, and professional liability matters, which the Company does not deem to be material to its business and condensed consolidated financial statements at this stage. Flathead Partners Litigation/Arbitration On July 15, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for breach of contract against Flathead Partners, LLC, the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, and Mayo Clinic Ventures (herein referred to as Flathead Partners ). The Company s suit alleged that Flathead Partners breached the 2006 license agreement between the Company and the Mayo Clinic (referred to in the Company s 10-K filing as the Mayo License ), when Flathead Partners unilaterally asserted control of pending U.S. Patent Application 16/286,389 (the 389 Application ), which is subject to the Mayo

period, subject to continued service, and are based on (1) the total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company s common stock price compared to the S P Healthcare Equipment Select Industry Index (the Index) over a period or (2) specific revenue targets over a performance period. Additionally, in 2022, the Company made PSU grants to its then CEO that included attainment criteria that required the Company's stock price to reach certain pre-specified stock prices. Since TSR and stock price attainment are considered market conditions, the PSUs based on TSR and stock price attainment have fair values that are determined at the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model, with the recorded expense based on fair value. Since revenue targets are considered performance conditions, the PSUs based on revenue targets have a fair value that is equal to the closing stock price on the grant date, with the recorded expense based on the fair value and the probability of achievement, which is reassessed at each reporting perio d. As of September 30, 2024, the probability of achievement was estimated to be for the PSU's granted in 2024, to for the PSU's granted in 2023, and for the PSU's granted in 2022. PSU grants were awarded in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Overview 
 We are a global medical device company focused on delivering comprehensive, life-changing solutions that continue to set the standard for enduring patient outcomes in chronic pain treatment. We have developed and commercialized our HFX spinal cord stimulation (SCS) platform, which includes the Senza SCS system, an evidence-based neuromodulation system for the treatment of chronic pain, with the Senza HFX iQ platform. In September 2024, we announced the FDA approval and limited market release of HFX iQ with HFX AdaptivAI , a responsive, personalized pain management platform powering the HFX iQ SCS system as our latest addition to the Senza family of products. Our HFX solution is approved to deliver a versatile range of waveforms, including our proprietary, paresthesia-free 10 kHz Therapy. Our 10 kHz Therapy was demonstrated in our SENZA randomized controlled trial (RCT) to be superior to traditional SCS therapy, with 10 kHz Therapy being nearly twice as successful in treating back pain and 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain when compared to traditional SCS therapy. In addition to the original approval of our therapy in back and leg pain, we received approval of our 10 kHz Therapy for the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) in July 2021 in the United States. We received expanded labeling in non-surgical back pain (NSBP) in January 2022 in the United States. Our SENZA-RCT study, along with our SENZA-PDN clinical study, SENZA-NSRBP clinical study and European studies, represents what we believe is the most robust body of clinical evidence for any SCS therapy. We believe the superiority of 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS therapies will allow us to capitalize on and expand the approximately 2.3 billion global SCS market by treating patients with debilitating chronic pain, including back and leg pain, NSBP and PDN. 
 We launched Senza commercially in the United States in May 2015, after receiving a label from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supporting the superiority of our 10 kHz Therapy over traditional SCS. The Senza system has been commercially available in certain European markets since November 2010 and in Australia since August 2011. Senza is currently reimbursed by all of the major insurance providers. 
 In November 2023, we acquired Vyrsa Technologies (Vyrsa), who developed and manufactured a portfolio of Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Fusion devices, expanding our chronic pain portfolio to treat patients diagnosed with SI Joint Dysfunction. With the addition of SI Joint to our pain portfolio, we are able to enter a growing market that builds upon our current customer base, leverages our existing sales force and the addition of the NevroV1 , NevroFix and NevroPro SI Joint products to our portfolio provides physicians we work with today with another option for treating their chronic pain patients. 
 In April 2023, we enrolled the first patient in our PDN Sensory study, the first prospective RCT to assess the restoration of neurological function as a primary objective in patients with intractable PDN. The study will enroll up to 236 patients at multiple sites across the United States. Patients will be randomized to conventional medical management (CMM) or 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM, 
 20 

with optional crossover to the other treatment arm at 6 months if those specific criteria are met. Given that enrollment was proceeding ahead of schedule, we executed a pre-planned pause in enrollment in May 2024 to allow for an interim primary endpoint analysis by an independent statistician of all subjects who are randomized to date. With this milestone, we hope to bring the results of this study to physicians sooner than initially contemplated to potentially accelerate adoption. We still may return to enrolling additional patients in the future.

Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and borrowings under a debt facility. Our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was 759.7 million. A significant amount of our capital resources has been used to support the development of our Senza products and our 10 kHz Therapy, and we have also made a significant investment building our U.S. commercial infrastructure and sales force to support our commercialization efforts in the United States. We intend to continue to make significant investments in our U.S. commercial infrastructure, including building out a sales organization that targets physician specialties involved in PDN treatment decisions, as well as in research and development (R D), and in conducting clinical trials to support our future regulatory submissions. In order to further enhance our R D efforts, pursue product expansion opportunities or acquire a new business or products that are complementary to our business, we may choose to raise additional funds, which may include future equity and debt financings. 
 We rely on third-party suppliers for the components of our Senza products. Several of these suppliers are currently single-source suppliers. We are also required to maintain high levels of inventory, and, as a result, we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence and expiration, which may lead to inventory impairment charges. Additionally, our dependence on third-party suppliers makes us vulnerable to supply shortage problems and exposes us to greater lead times, increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence. In the third quarter of 2020, we made the strategic decision to vertically integrate the assembly of IPG s, peripherals and various other manufacturing related activities to mitigate our reliance on third-party manufacturers and improve our long-term gross margins. We plan on conducting these manufacturing activities in our facility in Costa Rica, for which our lease began in April 2021. The integration process was completed in mid-2022, and we received approval from the FDA for the manufacture of our Senza system in the Costa Rica facility in September 2022. Even with the commencement of manufacturing in Costa Rica, we have continued to rely on third-party manufacturers as we ramped our factory and in order to provide key components to support the assembly process. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant capital expenditures and implementation costs in our Costa Rica facility. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Our business and financial performance are significantly impacted by macroeconomic conditions. Global macroeconomic challenges, such as the effects of the ongoing war between Russian and Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, political instability, supply chain constraints, market uncertainty, volatility in exchange rates, inflationary trends, lower consumer confidence and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment have impacted our business and financial performance. Such economic impacts could also impact the decision of patients and customers to seek and undertake elective procedures which would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, a recession or market correction resulting from other macroeconomic factors could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. The occurrence of any such events may lead to reduced disposable income and access to health insurance which could adversely affect the number of products sold as a result of customer and patient reluctance to seek elective care treatment due to increase patient copays and similar financial considerations. 
 21 

Adverse macroeconomic conditions, other pandemics or international tensions, could also result in significant disruption of global economic conditions and consumer trends, as well as a significant disruption in financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity, including our ability to repay our 2025 Notes and the Braidwell Term Loans. Our ability to repay the 2025 Notes and the Braidwell Term Loans could also be adversely impacted by higher interest rates which could make it more difficult to access capital on favorable terms, or at all. 
 Important Factors Affecting our Results of Operations 
 We believe that the following factors have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our results of operations. 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 The global economy is experiencing uncertainty around inflationary pressures and interest rates, supply chain issues, recession fears and lower consumer confidence as a result of current macroeconomic environment and geopolitical conditions. Higher interest rates and capital costs, increased costs of labor and volatile currency exchange rates are creating additional economic challenges. These conditions may cause patients to delay their decisions to seek medical elective procedures. 
 Importance of Physician Awareness and Acceptance of Our Products 
 We continue to invest in programs to educate physicians who treat chronic back and leg pain about the advantages of our products. This requires significant commitment by our marketing team and sales organization, and can vary depending upon the physician s practice specialization, personal preferences and geographic location. 
 Reimbursement and Coverage Decisions by Third-Party Payors 
 Healthcare providers in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, principally federal Medicare, state Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of our products and the related implant procedure for patients. The revenue we are able to generate from sales of our products depends in large part on the availability of reimbursement from such payors. Currently, there is a National Coverage Determination (NCD 160.7) that provides the conditions for coverage by Medicare as a late (if not last) resort for patients with chronic intractable pain. This broad coverage is inclusive of all our approved indications such as Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN), and Non Surgical Refractory Back Pain (NSBP). The local Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) cannot be more restrictive in coverage than this NCD. Only one MAC, Noridian, still has a Local Coverage Determination (LCD) which does not limit based on indications but does have a finite list of diagnosis they deem to meet medical necessity criteria. Decisions of coverage and reimbursement for Senza and the related implant procedure from private health insurance providers can vary. In general, these decisions require that such payors perform analyses to determine if the procedure is medically necessary and if our technology is a covered benefit under the patient's existing policies. These payors may deny pre-service prior authorization if they determine that the device or procedure is not medically necessary for the patient and used in accordance with the payor s coverage policy. Pre-service denials are able to be appealed through various channels with medical necessity decisions often made by third-parties based on an individual patient s medical history. 
 A significant component of our commercial efforts includes working with private payors to ensure positive coverage decisions for our products. For our traditional chronic back and leg pain market, we believe that favorable coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products from Medicare and certain commercial payors, such as Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) and United Healthcare, have contributed to our increase in revenue to date. Although the largest commercial payors and Medicare cover procedures using Senza, there can be no assurance that all private health insurance plans will cover the therapy. While Medicare, through both national and local coverage policies, currently provides coverage for NSBP, most commercial payors do not yet have coverage policies for NSBP and may consider coverage for this indication on a case-by-case basis. 
 Effective April 14, 2024, Carelon and Anthem BCBS updated their medical policy to explicitly cover PDN. These health plans cover approximately 44 million covered lives and brings total PDN coverage to over 250 million covered lives. 
 With respect to both PDN and NSBP, there are still some payors that have not yet updated their policies to expressly cover SCS procedures, including in the case of PDN, Cigna and Humana. Nevro s Patient Access team supports case-by-case approvals for these indications with these payors, however, a significant number of negative coverage and reimbursement decisions by private insurers may impair our ability or delay our ability to grow our revenue. 
 We are working to expand payor coverage to include the use of our 10 kHz Therapy for the management of PDN and NSBP. This effort could be costly and could take many years to gain broad acceptance, and there can be no guarantee that it will be successful. 
 22 

Inventory Buildup and Supply Chain Management 
 Our products are composed of a substantial number of individual components and, in order to market and sell them effectively, we must maintain high levels of inventory. We have continued to add suppliers to fortify our supply chain and we have maintained increased levels of inventory. As a result, a significant amount of our cash used in operations has been associated with maintaining these levels of inventory. There may also be times in which we determine that our inventory does not meet our product requirements. The manufacturing process for our products requires lengthy lead times, during which components may become obsolete. We may also over or underestimate the quantities of required components, in which case we may expend extra resources or be constrained in the amount of end product that we can produce. Additionally, as we release later generations of products that contain advancements or additional features, the earlier generations may become obsolete. These factors subject us to the risk of inventory obsolescence and expiration, which may lead to inventory impairment charges. The sum of the charges for the items listed above were 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Investment in Research and Clinical Trials 
 We intend to continue investing in R D to help our commercialization efforts around and to expand into new indications and chronic pain conditions, as well as develop product enhancements to improve outcomes and enhance the physician and patient experience. For example, we commenced commercial launches of Surpass, our surgical lead product family in early 2017 and Senza II SCS System in late 2017. We launched our Senza Omnia platform, in the United States in late 2019, in Europe during the second quarter of 2020 and in Australia in July 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we received FDA approvals for our first Senza Omnia upgrade and a new trial stimulator. In July 2021, we received FDA approval of our 10 kHz Therapy for the management of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain, associated with PDN. In January 2022, we received regulatory approval for expanded labeling to include NSBP. In October 2022, we received FDA approval of our latest generation SCS system, HFX iQ , which we launched on a limited basis in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022 and more fully in 2023. In September 2024, we announced the FDA approval and limited market release of HFX iQ with HFX AdaptivAI , a responsive, personalized pain management platform powering the HFX iQ SCS system as our latest addition to the Senza family of products. We are continuing to invest in product improvements to Senza, including enhanced MRI capabilities and next generation IPGs. While R D and clinical testing are time consuming and costly, we believe expanding into new indications, implementing product improvements and continuing to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of the 10 kHz Therapy through clinical data are all critical to increasing the adoption of this therapy. 
 The SENZA-PDN study was one of the largest RCT conducted in the field of spinal cord stimulation with 216 randomized patients. The study evaluated paresthesia-free 10 kHz Therapy among patients diagnosed with PDN and refractory to CMM. Patients were randomized one-to-one to CMM alone or CMM with 10 kHz Therapy. A crossover study design was used, where subjects who did not have adequate pain relief at 6 months were given the option to cross over to the other treatment arm. Subjects were followed for 24 months, with subjects who crossed over from CMM alone to CMM with 10 kHz Therapy followed for 24 months post-implantation. In April 2021, the six-month data were published online in JAMA Neurology. In July 2021, the FDA approved the Senza System for the treatment of chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs, including unilateral and bilateral pain, associated with PDN. This approval is specific to Nevro s unique 10 kHz SCS stimulation, and the Senza system was the first spinal cord stimulation system approved by the FDA with a specific indication to treat PDN. In September 2022, the study was completed, and the study results have been presented at numerous conferences and published in multiple journal publications. 
 Our other large RCT, the SENZA-NSRBP study, was executed to support the new indication for treatment of non-surgical back pain (NSBP) which includes patients with NSBP. NSBP is defined as chronic back pain in patients who have not had previous spine surgery, and based on an assessment from a spine surgeon, are not surgical candidates. The study compared patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy plus CMM to patients receiving CMM alone. In January 2022, the FDA approved the Senza System as an aid in the management of NSBP (intractable back pain without prior surgery and not a candidate for back surgery) based on 6 month efficacy data showing profound improvements in pain and function with 10 kHz Therapy over CMM alone. At the 2022 NANS conference, we presented our 12-month results, including six-month crossover patient data, for the SENZA-NSRBP study. Key findings at 12 months showed profound improvements in pain relief, function, quality of life measures, awareness of positive change and reduction in daily opioid use in NSBP patients receiving 10 kHz Therapy at 12-months post-implant. Results also included comparable improvements for patients that crossed over from CMM to 10 kHz after 6 months. In February 2022, the SENZA-NSRBP 12-month results were published online in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine . Finally, in January 2023, we presented the full 24-month results from the SENZA-NSRBP study at the 2023 NANS conference, and the full manuscript reporting the 24-month results was published in Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine in November 2023. We have utilized this 24-month publication in our Patient Access efforts by successfully obtaining case-by-case prior authorization approvals in the absence of defined payor medical policies or explicit non-coverage policies. We expect that this 24-month publication will be critical in efforts to expand payor coverage for this patient cohort. 
 23 

Significant Investment in U.S. Sales Organization 
 In 2021, we established a sales organization to support the launch of our PDN indication in the United States. This sales organization targets physician specialties involved in PDN treatment decisions, including primary care physicians, endocrinologists, internal medicine and podiatrists, to create awareness of 10 kHz Therapy to treat PDN patients. We are continuing to make investments in building our U.S. commercial infrastructure and recruiting and training our U.S. sales force. This is a lengthy process that requires recruiting appropriate sales representatives, establishing and, on occasion, refining a commercial infrastructure in the United States and training our sales representatives. Following initial training for Senza, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and produce sales results. Successfully recruiting and training a sufficient number of productive sales representatives has been required to achieve growth at the rate we expect. 
 Access to Hospital Facilities 
 In the United States, in order for physicians to use our products, the hospital facilities where these physicians treat patients often require us to enter into purchasing contracts directly with the hospital facilities or with the Group Purchasing Organizations of which the hospital facilities are members. This process can be lengthy and time-consuming and requires extensive negotiations and management time. In Europe, we may be required to engage in a contract bidding process in order to sell our products, where the bidding processes are only open at certain periods of time, and we may not be successful in the bidding process. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no significant or material changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. 
 Goodwill 
 We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We have one reporting unit. Accordingly, our review of goodwill impairment indicators is performed at the entity-wide level. Goodwill is 38.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We considered whether the decline in the price of our common stock, which resulted in our market capitalization dropping below the value of our net assets in the third quarter, would require us to perform an impairment assessment. We considered other factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market environments and other relevant company-specific events and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Thus, an interim goodwill impairment assessment was not performed as of September 30, 2024. Further events and circumstances such as a continued or sustained decline in the price of our common stock, market capitalization or revenue could result in impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenue is generated primarily from sales to two types of customers: hospitals and outpatient medical facilities, with each being served primarily through a direct sales force. Sales to these entities are billed to, and paid by, the hospitals and outpatient medical facilities as part of their normal payment processes, with payment received by us in the form of an electronic transfer, check or credit card payment. Product sales to third-party distributors are billed to and paid by the distributors as part of their normal payment processes, with payment received by us in the form of an electronic transfer. 
 U.S. revenue is generally recognized after our sales representatives deliver our product at the point of implantation and upon the completion and authorization of the implant procedure. In response to competitive practices and pressures, we have offered some volume price discounting for larger orders, where products are ordered in advance of an implantation and revenue is recognized when the transfer of control occurs at the time of shipment. 
 24 

Revenue from sales fluctuates based on the selling price of the products, as the average sales price of our products vary geographically and by the generation of the product sold, and based on the mix of sales by geography. Our revenue from international sales can also be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as our sales are denominated in the local currency in the countries in which we sell our products. 
 We expect our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including seasonality. For example, the industry generally experiences lower revenues in the first and third quarters of the year and higher revenues in the fourth quarter. Our revenue has been impacted by these industry trends. Further, the impact of the buying patterns and implant volumes of hospitals and medical facilities, and third-party distributors may vary, and as a result could have an effect on our revenue from quarter to quarter. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of acquisition costs of components of our products, manufacturing overhead, scrap and inventory excess and obsolescence charges, as well as distribution-related expenses, such as logistics and shipping costs, net of costs charged to customers. 
 We calculate gross margin as revenue less cost of revenue divided by revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, but primarily by our average sales price and the costs to have our products manufactured. While costs are primarily incurred in U.S. dollars, international revenue may be impacted by the appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar, which may impact our overall gross margin. Our gross margin is also affected by our ability to reduce manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of R D expense and sales, general and administrative (SG A) expenses, amortization of intangibles and change in fair value of contingent consideration. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries, bonus incentives, benefits, stock-based compensation and sales commissions. 
 Research and Development . R D costs are expensed as incurred. R D expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salary, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for our R D employees. R D expense also includes costs associated with product design efforts, development prototypes, testing, clinical trial programs and regulatory activities, contractors and consultants, equipment and software to support our development, facilities and information technology. We expect product development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop product enhancements to our products. Our R D expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our R D and clinical trial expenses. 
 Sales, General and Administrative . SG A expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salary, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for our sales and marketing personnel, including sales commissions, and for administrative personnel that support our general operations, such as information technology, executive management, financial accounting, customer service and human resources personnel. We expense commissions at the time of the sale. SG A expense also includes costs attributable to marketing, as well as travel, intellectual property and other legal fees, financial audit fees, insurance, fees for other consulting services, depreciation and facilities. 
 In 2021, we established a sales organization to support the launch of our PDN indication in the U.S. This sales organization targets physician specialties involved in PDN treatment decisions, including primary care physicians, endocrinologists, internal medicine and podiatrists, to create awareness of 10 kHz Therapy to treat PDN patients. We have continued to invest significant spend in marketing efforts in order to generate additional sales opportunities. Additionally, we have made substantial investments in our U.S. commercial infrastructure to support our commercialization efforts in the United States. We expect SG A expenses to decrease as a percent of revenue as we engage in activities that leverage our existing sales and marketing personnel to support the commercialization of our products in the United States. 
 In the years leading up to 2022, we had experienced significant legal expenses associated with our intellectual property litigation with Boston Scientific. We continued to incur significant legal expenses associated with intellectual property litigation in 2023. Additionally, we continue to incur significant expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, including compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public company. Our SG A expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality of our revenue and the timing and extent of our SG A expense. 
 25 

Amortization of Intangibles. Our amortization expense relates to intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition. 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. Our acquisition of Vyrsa includes a contingent consideration arrangement, for which we recognized a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record any changes in fair value. Changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving milestones may result in changes in the fair value. 
 Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our investments and interest expense consists of interest paid on our outstanding debt and the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrants 
 The value of the Braidwell Warrants are remeasured to the Fair Market Value at the end of each reporting period while they remain outstanding. The change in the fair value of these warrants are recorded as change in fair value of warrants in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and the gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign-denominated balances to the U.S. dollar. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business as well as states where we have determined we have state nexus. We maintain a full valuation allowance for all of our U.S. deferred tax assets including net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and federal and state tax credits.

Revenue in the United States was 83.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 7 decrease from 89.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. International revenue was 13.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in our trial and permanent implant volumes from the prior year.

Cost of revenue decreased to 32.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 34.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of 2.1 million, or 6 . This was primarily driven by a decrease of 3.1 million due to a decrease in the number of units sold and lower product costs as a result of moving production to our Costa Rica manufacturing facility, which was partially offset by an increase of 0.8 million in the write-down of inventory. Gross profit decreased to 64.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 69.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.9 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, was 67 in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Interest Income . Interest income increased slightly to 10.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher average investment return rates during 2024. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense increased to 20.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In November 2023, we entered into the Braidwell Credit Agreement, from which we recorded 16.6 million in interest expense and 2.7 million in the amortization of debt issuance costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of interest expense from the Braidwell Credit Agreement was offset by a decrease of 3.9 million in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs for the 2025 Notes, due to our repurchase of 151.7 million in principal of our 2025 Notes. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrants . The value of the outstanding Braidwell Warrants requires remeasurement at each reporting date. The change in the fair value of these warrants was a gain of 26.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net . Other income (expense), net was primarily comprised of foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances. 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Income tax expense was 0.9 million in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The income tax expense for both periods was principally comprised of foreign income tax and state income tax. We continued to have NOL carryforwards creating a deferred tax asset. We have a full valuation allowance for all of our U.S. deferred tax assets. 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations through revenue generated from our operations, private placements of preferred stock, the issuance of common stock in our IPO in November 2014 and our underwritten public offering in June 2015, borrowings under our credit facility, which we have subsequently repaid, and the June 2016 issuance of convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes). In April 2020, we completed a concurrent underwritten public offering of common stock and convertible senior notes due 2025. Our total net proceeds from the April 2020 offerings, after giving effect to the note hedge transactions and warrant transactions and associated offering expense, was 313.3 million. On June 1, 2021, our outstanding 2021 Notes matured and we paid 172.5 million to settle the outstanding principal and issued 682,912 shares of common stock to holders who elected to convert the 2021 Notes. In November 2023, we entered into the Braidwell Credit Agreement for 200.0 million, and we used portions of the proceeds to repurchase 151.7 million of our 2025 Notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 277.0 million. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with the anticipated funds from the collection of our receivables, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. 
 We expect to incur continued expenditures in the future in support of our commercial infrastructure and sales force. In addition, we intend to continue to make investments in the further development of our products, including ongoing R D programs and conducting clinical trials. In order to further enhance our R D efforts, pursue product expansion opportunities or acquire a new business or products that are complementary to our business, we may choose to raise additional funds. 
 29 

We may continue to seek funds through equity or debt financings, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. Should we choose to raise additional capital, the requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the impact from any recession or other adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to increased interest rates, inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts and lower consumer confidence; 

the costs related to the continued commercialization of our products in the United States and elsewhere, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; 

the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the R D activities we intend to undertake in order to expand the chronic pain indications and product enhancements that we intend to pursue; 

whether or not we pursue acquisitions or investments in businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our current business; 

the degree and rate of market acceptance of our products in the United States and elsewhere; 

changes or fluctuations in our inventory supply needs and forecasts of our supply needs; 

costs related to the development of our internal manufacturing capabilities; 

our need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems; 

our ability to hire additional personnel to support our operations as a public company; and 

the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments. 

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to establish a competitive position in the neuromodulation market by securing broad market acceptance of our 10 kHz Therapy and our Senza product platform for the treatment of chronic pain conditions, as well as our ability to gain market acceptance for other products, such as our SI Joint product portfolio. Any product we develop that achieves regulatory clearance or approval will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. We face significant competition in the United States and internationally, which we believe will intensify as we continue to commercialize in the United States. For example, our major competitors, Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories, each have approved neuromodulation systems in at least the United States, Europe and Australia and have been established for several years. In addition to these major competitors, we may also face competition from other emerging competitors and smaller companies with active neuromodulation system development programs that may emerge in the future. 
 If we are unable to raise, or have access, to sufficient funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our commercial development plans.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of the net loss recorded during the period of 60.3 million. The cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was affected by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 15.9 million and change in fair value of warrants of 26.5 million. These changes were partially offset by the recording of non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 38.7 million, non-cash interest expense of 8.2 million, depreciation and amortization of 6.0 million, change in fair value of contingent consideration of 3.1 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 7.5 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was primarily 
 30 

a result of the net loss recorded during the period of 83.2 million and amortization of premiums in our debt securities of 2.8 million, as well as increases in inventory of 24.8 million and decreases in other long term liabilities of 4.1 million. These changes were partially offset by the recording of non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 43.2 million, depreciation and amortization of 4.9 million, amortization of operating lease assets of 3.3 million and write-down of inventory of 3.0 million, as well as decreases in accounts receivable of 9.4 million.

We had net proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments of 17.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We also had purchases of property and equipment of 7.8 million and 6.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we purchased secured convertible notes issued by a private company totaling 1.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities . Financing activities consisted primarily of tax withholdings for net share settlement and cash received from the issuance of common stock to employees pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had proceeds from issuance of common stock of 2.7 million, offset by tax withholdings of 2.3 million. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made a 5.0 million payment related to the contingent consideration. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had proceeds from issuance of common stock of 5.2 million, offset by tax withholdings of 4.4 million. 
 Restructuring 
 On January 6, 2024, we approved a restructuring plan to accelerate our path to profitability that included laying off 63 employees, which represented approximately 5 of our total number of employees. Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflected a 5.5 million restructuring charge, consisting of one-time severance and other termination benefit costs. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we approved additional restructuring steps to further accelerate its path to profitability. Operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 reflected a restructuring charge of 4.6 million and 0.7 million, respectively, consisting of one-time severance and other termination benefit costs. For the nine months ended, September 30, 2024, we recognized 10.8 million of restructuring charge. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all severance and other termination benefit amounts have been paid. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We have lease obligations primarily consisting of operating leases for our principal offices, which expire as set forth below, and for our warehouse space. In 2020, we also entered into an operating lease for a manufacturing facility with an expiration date of June 2031. 
 In March 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 50,740 square feet of office space located in Redwood City, California for a period beginning in June 2015 and ending in May 2022, with initial annual payments of approximately 2.0 million, increasing to 2.4 million annually in the final year of the lease term. In December 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the lease for an additional approximately 49,980 square feet of office space adjacent to the premises under the original lease (the Expansion Premises) with initial annual payments of 1.2 million, increasing to 2.9 million in the final year of the amended lease term. The lease for the Expansion Premises commenced on June 1, 2018. The first amendment also extends the lease term for the original premises to terminate on the same date as the amended lease, which is May 31, 2025. In April 2024, we entered into an amendment which reduced the total office space to approximately 77,620 square feet, beginning June 1, 2024 through December 31, 2031, with annual payments of 3.0 million, increasing to 5.7 million in the final year of the amended lease term. See Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies , of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 In February 2017, we entered into a separate non-cancellable facility lease for warehouse space beginning March 1, 2017 through February 28, 2022, under which we are obligated to pay approximately 0.4 million in lease payments over the term of the lease. In October 2021, we extended our warehouse lease through May 2025, under which we are obligated to pay approximately 0.4 million over the extended term. 
 In August 2020, we entered into a lease for approximately 35,411 square feet of manufacturing space to begin in April 2021 and to last through June 2031 at a facility in Costa Rica, under which we are obligated to pay approximately 3.9 million in lease payments over the term of the lease.

In September 2024, we entered into a lease for 13,623 square feet of warehouse space located in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania to commence on the later of December 1, 2024 or completion of the landlord's building improvements. The lease is through February 2033, under which we are obligated to pay 2.0 million over the term of the lease. 
 We have entered into supply agreements with certain suppliers that require certain minimum annual purchase agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had minimum annual purchase commitments of 1.1 million due for the remainder of 2024 and 4.9 million due in 2025. In addition, we renegotiated a supplier contract resulting in a one-time 6.0 million fee, expensed as of June 30, 2024. We paid 4.0 million of the renegotiation fee during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The renegotiation reduced our future purchase commitments enabling us to accelerate the move of inventory production to our Costa Rica facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations related to the 2025 Notes are payments of interest of 0.5 million due for the remainder of 2024 and payments of interest and principal totaling 38.6 million due in April 2025. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations related to the Braidwell Term Loan are payments of interest of 2.8 million due for the remainder of 2024, 17.3 million due in 2025, 17.9 million due in 2026 and 20.3 million due in 2027, as well as payments of interest, principal and fees totaling 46.1 million due in 2028 and 232.1 million in 2029. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Through September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. For information regarding indemnification obligations, refer to Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies , of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements within this report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposures to other market risks related to fluctuation in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , in our Annual Report. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Risks Related to our Business 
 Declines in our market capitalization could result in the recognition of an impairment charge to goodwill, net tangible assets or identifiable intangible assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock. 
 We review our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The total purchase price pertaining to our acquisitions have been allocated to goodwill, net tangible assets, and identifiable intangible assets. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. An adverse change in market conditions, significant decrease in market capitalization, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill, net tangible assets or identifiable intangible assets. To the extent the value of goodwill, net tangible assets or identifiable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment. Any impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock.
