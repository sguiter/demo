 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of NanoSynex, Ltd. NanoSynex from Alpha
Capital Anstalt Alpha ), a related party, in exchange for reverse split adjusted shares of the Company s
common stock and a prefunded warrant to purchase reverse split adjusted shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise
price of per share. These warrants were subsequently exercised on September 13, 2022. Concurrently with this transaction, the
Company also entered into a Master Funding Agreement for the Operational and Technology Funding of NanoSynex Ltd., dated May 26, 2022,
with NanoSynex (the NanoSynex Funding Agreement ), to, among other things, provide for the further funding of NanoSynex,
and purchased shares of Series B preferred stock from NanoSynex for a total purchase price of . The transactions resulted
in the Company acquiring a interest in NanoSynex (the NanoSynex Acquisition ). NanoSynex is a nanotechnology diagnostics
company domiciled in Israel. On July 20, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment and Settlement Agreement with NanoSynex (the NanoSynex
Amendment ), which amended the NanoSynex Funding Agreement, to, among other things, eliminate most of the Company obligation for
the further funding of NanoSynex. Pursuant to the terms of the NanoSynex Amendment, the Company lost its controlling interest in NanoSynex
(see Note 5 -Discontinued Operations). 

Reverse
Stock Split of the Company s common stock, which became effective on November 5, 2024. The Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized
shares of common stock, which remains at , and did not change the par value of the common stock, which remains at 
per share. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifty shares of the common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding
share of common stock and no fractional shares were issued. Stockholders who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share in connection with the Reverse Stock Split will receive a cash payment in lieu thereof. 

All
share and per share information shown herein has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split Amendment
for all periods presented. 

Series B Preferred Shares of NanoSynex held
by the Company, resulting in the deconsolidation of NanoSynex. The disposition represents a strategic shift that will have a material
effect on the Company s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the business of NanoSynex is classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented herein. 

See
Note 5 - Discontinued Operations for further information. 

such impairment
losses have been recorded. 

in cash and an accumulated deficit of million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, we used cash of million and million, respectively, in operations. 

The
Company s cash balances as of the date that these financial statements were issued, without additional financing, are expected
to fund operations through the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company expects to continue to have net losses and negative cash flow from
operations, which will challenge its liquidity. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern for the one-year period following the date that these financial statements were issued. There is no assurance that profitable
operations will ever be achieved, or, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. 

Historically,
the Company s principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity and proceeds from
the issuance of debt. Between February 2024 and April 2024 the Company raised million from the sale of Convertible Debentures (see
Note 8 - Convertible Debt - Related Party). In July 2024 the Company raised an additional million from the sale of a nonconvertible
18 Senior Note, which was subsequently repaid in September 2024. In September 2024, the Company raised additional net proceeds of approximately
 million from the sale of common stock and prefunded warrants in a public offering. There can be no assurance that further financing
can be obtained on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be required to delay, reduce
or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely
affect the Company s business prospects. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, and therefore, be
required to liquidate its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts that may differ
from those reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

On
July 15, 2024, the Company advanced to Marizyme, Inc., against which Marizyme had previously delivered its demand promissory
note to the Company of like principal amount dated July 12, 2024 (the Marizyme Note ). The Marizyme Note bears interest
the rate of eighteen percent per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of the outstanding principal or interest of the Marizyme
Note at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. 

Under ASC 326-20, known as the current expected credit
loss ("CECL") model, the Company was required to estimate credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures)
based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The conclusion was that if the Company
were to demand repayment of the loan mentioned above, management expects that the Company would be able to recover substantially all of
its investment in a presumed liquidation of Marizyme s assets, as the Company has seniority in any future bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding. As such, management estimates the expected credit losses on the Marizyme Note to be zero as of September 30, 2024. 

The Company is also party to a Co-Development Agreement with Marizyme (see Note 11 - Research and License Agreements).

Amendment
and Settlement Agreement with NanoSynex Ltd. 

On
July 20, 2023, the Company entered into and effectuated the NanoSynex Amendment, reducing its ownership from approximately to approximately
 of the voting equity of NanoSynex, and deconsolidation of the subsidiary. On November 22, 2023, the Company further agreed to
eliminate the Company s obligations to lend additional funds to NanoSynex by surrendering shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
of NanoSynex in an amount that reduced the Company s ownership in NanoSynex voting equity from approximately to . 

On
the date of deconsolidation, the Company recognized its retained investment at fair value, which during the preparation of these financial
statements was determined to be de minimis based on various economic, industry, and other factors. As a result, the Company has discontinued
recognition of its proportionate share of equity method losses following the date of initial recognition. Future equity method earnings,
if any, will not be recognized until the amount exceeds the unrecognized net losses in prior periods. 

There
were no assets and liabilities recognized related to NanoSynex as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

There
was no activity related to NanoSynex during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reclassified the following
statement of operations items to discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023:

Series C Warrants outstanding with an exercise
price of per share. 

On
December 22, 2022, in conjunction with the issuance of the Debenture to Alpha (see Note 8 Convertible Debt), the Company issued
to Alpha a warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Alpha Warrant ). The exercise price
of the Alpha Warrant was (equal to of the conversion price of the Debenture on the closing date). The Alpha Warrant may be
exercised by Alpha, in whole or in part, on or after June 22, 2023 and at any time before June 22, 2028, subject to certain terms and
conditions described in the Alpha Warrant. The fair value of this Alpha Warrant was included in Warrant liabilities-related party on
the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. On December 5, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment No.
1 with regard to a Securities Purchase Agreement, with Alpha. This Amendment eliminated certain adjustment provisions of the Warrant.
The Company determined the event resulted in equity classification for the Warrant and, accordingly, the Company remeasured the warrant
liabilities to fair value, and reclassified to noncompensatory equity classified warrants (see Note 12 - Stockholders Equity). 

On
November 24, 2023, Series C Warrants expired, and on December 5, 2023 the remaining Series C Warrants were repriced from an
exercise price of per share to an exercise price of per share, with additional ratchet Series C Warrants issued,
resulting in of these Series C Warrants outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2023. 

On
February 27, 2024, these Series C Warrants were repriced again as a result of a down-round provision triggered by a Securities Purchase
Agreement with Alpha for the purchase of the February 2024 Debenture, from an exercise price of per share to an exercise price
of per share, with additional ratchet Series C Warrants issued, resulting in of these Series C Warrants outstanding
and exercisable, and on June 26, 2024 these remaining Series C Warrants expired. 

On
April 12, 2024, in connection with an 
Convertible Debenture in the principal amount of 
issued to Yi Hua Chen Chen (see Note 8 Convertible Debt), we issued a liability classified warrant to Chen
purchase 
shares of our common stock, exercisable until February 27, 2029. On September 6, 2024 as a result of the down-round provision triggered by shares sold in a public offering, the
above warrants were repriced from per share exercise price to per share exercise price. The warrant remains outstanding
and exercisable and was liability classified as of September 30, 2024 due to an insufficient number of authorized shares to settle the
warrant prior to the receipt of shareholder approval, which was subsequently obtained on October 25, 2024. The fair value of the
warrant was 
on the issuance date and 
at September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on change in fair
value of warrant liabilities of 
and for this warrant. 

As
a result of a partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture on September 9, 2024, as of September 30, 2024 the Company no
longer had sufficient shares to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant in full until shareholder approval was obtained, and a portion

Gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities 

Balance as of September 30, 2024 

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, warrants for common shares with an exercise price of with a fair value of as of
September 30, 2024 were reclassified from equity to liabilities. There
were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between category levels for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
value of the warrant liabilities was based on a valuation received from an independent valuation firm determined using a Monte-Carlo
simulation. For volatility, the Company considers comparable public companies as a basis for its expected volatility to calculate the
fair value of common stock warrants and transitions to its own volatility as the Company develops sufficient appropriate history as a
public company. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected term of the common
stock warrant. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and
does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any significant changes in the inputs may result in significantly higher
or lower fair value measurements.

Senior Convertible Debenture in the aggregate principal amount of 
for a purchase price of 
pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated December 21, 2022 (the 2022 Securities Purchase
Agreement ). The 2022 Debenture has a maturity date of and is convertible, at any time, and from time to time, until the 2022 Debenture is no longer outstanding, at
Alpha s option, into shares of our common stock (the Conversion Shares ), at a price initially equal to
 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2022 Debenture and other terms and conditions described in the
2022 Debenture. On July 13, 2023, we obtained stockholder approval, for purposes of complying with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), for
the issuance to Alpha of more than 
of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of (a) the 2022 Debenture, and (b) the
common stock purchase warrant dated December 22, 2022 issued by us to Alpha. Between January 9 and 12, 2023, we issued 
shares of common stock upon Alpha s partial voluntary conversion of the 2022 Debenture at a conversion price of 
per share for a total of 
principal. In October and December 2023, we issued 
shares of common stock to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments on the 2022 Debenture at a weighted average price of
 per share. 

During the three and nine months
ending September 30, 2024, we issued and
 shares of common stock, respectively to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments on and voluntary
conversions of the 2022 Debenture at a weighted average conversion price of and per share, respectively, and a weighted average fair value of and per share, respectively. 

During the three and nine months ending September 30, 2023, we issued and shares of common stock,
respectively to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments on, and voluntary conversions of the 2022 Debenture at a weighted
average conversion price of and per share, respectively, and a weighted average fair value of and per share,
respectively. 

Commencing
June 1, 2023 (the Initial Monthly Redemption Date and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until the earlier
of (i) December 22, 2025 and (ii) the full redemption of the 2022 Debenture (each such date, a Monthly Redemption Date ),
we must redeem plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and any amounts then owing under the 2022 Debenture (the
 Monthly Redemption Amount ). The Monthly Redemption Amount must be paid in cash; provided that after the first two
monthly redemptions, we may elect to pay all or a portion of a Monthly Redemption Amount in shares of our common stock, based on a conversion
price equal to the lesser of (i) the then conversion price of the 2022 Debenture and (ii) of the average of the VWAPs (as defined
in the 2022 Debenture) for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is immediately before the applicable Monthly
Redemption Date, subject to the Equity Conditions (as defined in the 2022 Debenture) having been satisfied or waived. 

The
2022 Debenture accrued interest at the rate of per annum, which did not begin accruing until December 1, 2023, and was payable
on a monthly or quarterly basis. Interest may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our option; provided
that interest may only be paid in shares if the Equity Conditions have been satisfied or waived. 

In
December 2022, pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement, we entered into a registration rights agreement with
Alpha (the Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which we agreed to file one or more registration statements, as
necessary, and to the extent permissible, to register under the Securities Act the resale of the remaining shares (underlying the 2022
Debenture and the 2022 Warrant) not otherwise registered under the Company s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-266430).
The Registration Rights Agreement requires that the Company file, within 30 days after signing, a resale registration statement and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the resale registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC on or before the 60 th
 calendar day following the date of signing of the Registration Rights Agreement (or 120 days if such registration statement is
subject to full review by the SEC). We filed a resale registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to the requirements of the Registration
Rights Agreement on December 2022 (File Number 333-269088), which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on January
5, 2023. On September 1, 2023, we filed a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Form S-3 on Form S-1 (File No. 333-269088), which Post-Effective
Amendment was declared effective by the SEC on September 7, 2023. On May 1, 2024, we filed a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 to Form S-1
on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269088), which Post-Effective Amendment was declared effective by the SEC on May 2, 2024. 

The
Company evaluated the 2022 Debenture and the 2022 Warrant and determined that the 2022 Warrant is a freestanding financial instrument.
Initially, the 2022 Warrant is not considered indexed to the Company s own stock, because the settlement amount would not equal
the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of the Company s equity shares and a fixed strike price and all of the
adjustment features in Section 3(b) of the Alpha Warrant are not down round provisions, as defined in ASU 2017-11. Accordingly, the 2022
Warrant was classified as a liability and recognized at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 

The
proceeds from the 2022 Debenture were allocated to the initial fair value of the 2022 Warrant, with the residual balance allocated to
the initial carrying value of the 2022 Debenture. The Company has not elected the fair value option for the 2022 Debenture. The 2022
Debenture was recognized as proceeds received after allocating the proceeds to the 2022 Warrant, and then allocating remaining proceeds
to a suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features (conversion option, contingent acceleration upon an Event of Default, and contingent
interest upon an Event of Default), with the resulting difference, if any, allocated to the loan host instrument. The suite of derivative
features was measured and determined to have no fair value. 

The
original issue discount of million, the initial fair value of the 2022 Warrant of million, the initial fair value of the suite
of bifurcated embedded derivative features of , and the fees and costs paid to Alpha and other third parties of million comprised
the debt discount upon issuance. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the 2022 Debenture using
the effective interest method, in accordance with ASC 835-30. The debt host instrument of the 2022 Debenture will subsequently be measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method to accrete interest over its term to bring the 2022 Debenture s initial carrying
value to the principal balance at maturity. 

On
December 5, 2023, the Company and Alpha executed Amendment No. 1 with regard to Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA Amendment ),
pursuant to which the Company and Alpha agreed to, among other things, reduce the Conversion Price of the 2022 Debenture from per
share to per share and reduce the exercise price of the 2022 Warrant from per share to per share, in each case subject
to certain adjustments. In addition, the SPA Amendment revised certain provisions of the 2022 Warrant to (i) limit the circumstances
which would trigger a potential adjustment to the exercise price of the 2022 Warrant and (ii) clarify the treatment of the 2022 Warrant
upon a Fundamental Transaction. The purpose of these revisions was to remove the terms that caused the 2022 Warrant to be liability-classified
under U.S. GAAP. The Company performed an assessment and concluded that all remaining adjustment features in the revised language meet
the FASB s definition of a down-round feature. In addition, the 2022 Warrant was determined to meet all of the additional requirements
for equity classification. Accordingly, as of December 5, 2023, the Company remeasured the 2022 Warrant to its fair value immediately
prior to the modification and recognized the change in fair value in earnings. The incremental fair value impact from the 2022 Warrant
modification of million was included in the Company s evaluation of the 2022 Debenture modification under ASC 470, discussed
further below. The Company then reclassified the 2022 Warrant liability to equity at its post-modification fair value of million. 

In
accordance with ASC 470-50, the Company determined that the modified terms of the 2022 Debenture were substantially different when compared
to the original terms that existed prior to the SPA Amendment, and thus the event was required to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment.
Accordingly, the Company derecognized the net carrying value of the original Debenture, and recorded the new debt instrument at its fair
value of million, and recorded a million loss on debt extinguishment. The difference between the remaining 2022 Debenture principal
and its fair value on December 5, 2023 was recorded as a debt discount and will be amortized to interest expense over the expected term
of the Debenture using the effective interest method, in accordance with ASC 835-30. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of approximately ,
and a loss of approximately 
respectively, upon debenture share redemptions, and recorded interest expense of approximately 
and (of which
approximately 
and 
was attributable to discount accretion, respectively) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 respectively, in other
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations related to the 2022 Debenture. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair
value of the suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features related to the 2022 Debenture was . 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded interest of approximately and million , respectively (of which approximately and
 million was attributable to discount amortization, respectively) in other expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the Alpha Warrant was approximately million, and the fair
value of the suite of bifurcated embedded derivative features was . 

On
July 3, 2024 and July 5, 2024 Alpha voluntarily converted the remainder of the 2022 Debenture. 

2024
Convertible Debenture (Related party) 

On
February 27, 2024, upon our receipt of a cash purchase price payment of less expenses, we issued to Alpha an Convertible
Debenture (the 2024 Alpha Debenture in the principal amount of . The 2024 Alpha Debenture matures no later than
December 31, 2024 and was convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Alpha s option, into shares of common stock of the
Company, at per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2024 Alpha Debenture. Except in respect of an Exempt Issuance,
the 2024 Alpha Debenture contains a ratchet antidilution provision, with a per share floor. Upon the closing of the public offering on September 6, 2024 per the terms of the antidilution
provision, the conversion price of the 2024 Alpha Debenture was reduced from to per share. The 2024 Alpha Debenture accrues
interest on its outstanding principal balance at the rate of per annum, payable at maturity. In connection with this issuance, we
also issued to Alpha a noncompensatory equity classified -year common stock purchase warrant to purchase (at per share) 
shares of our common stock (see Note 12 - Stockholders Equity (Deficit)). 

We
also granted to Alpha an option, exercisable until July 1, 2024, to purchase from us additional Convertible Debentures, of like tenor,
with face amounts of up to an aggregate of (and with a proportional number of accompanying common stock warrants of like tenor,
up to a total of additional warrants). 

On September 9, 2024 we issued shares
of common stock upon Alpha s partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture at a conversion price of per share
for a total of principal.

and , respectively
was attributable to discount accretion), and loss (gain) on change in derivative liabilities of approximately and ), respectively in other expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the suite of bifurcated embedded derivative
features related to the 2024 Alpha Debenture was approximately . 

The
Securities Purchase Agreement related to the issuance of 2024 Alpha Debenture resulted in down-round provisions of various warrants being
triggered which resulted in reductions of the exercise price of these warrants from 
 per share to 
 per share (see Note 7 - Warrant Liabilities and Note 12 - Stockholders Equity (Deficit).

In
April 2024, Alpha assigned its option to Chen and Chen exercised the option in full, in exchange for ,

The 2024 Chen Debenture matures no later than December 31, 2024 and was convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at
Chen s option, into shares of common stock of the Company, at per share, subject to adjustment as described in
the 2024 Chen Debenture. Except in respect of an Exempt Issuance, the 2024 Chen Debenture contains a ratchet 
antidilution provision, with a per share floor. Upon the closing of the public offering on September 6, 2024 per the
terms of the antidilution provision, the conversion price of the 2024 Chen Debenture was reduced from to per share. The
2024 Chen Debenture accrues interest on its outstanding principal balance at the rate of

providers. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and outstanding stock options, respectively, under

to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 

The
exercise price for an option issued under the 2020 Plan is determined by the Board of Directors, but will be (i) in the case of an incentive
stock option (A) granted to an employee who, at the time of grant of such option, is a 10 stockholder, no less than 110 of the fair
market value per share on the date of grant; or (B) granted to any other employee, no less than 100 of the fair market value per share
on the date of grant; and (ii) in the case of a non-statutory stock option, no less than 100 of the fair market value per share on the
date of grant. The options awarded under the 2020 Plan will vest as determined by the Board of Directors but will not exceed a ten-year
period. A forfeiture is recognized as incurred if the option holder does not exercise after 90 days following termination of service. 

Fair
Value of Equity Awards 

The
Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value awards under its equity plans. Key valuation assumptions include: 

Expected
 dividend yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero, as the Company has never
 paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on the Company s common
 stock. 

Expected
 stock-price volatility. The Company s expected volatility is derived from the average
 historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within the Company s industry
 that the Company considers to be comparable to the Company s business over a period
 approximately equal to the expected term, because the Company does not have sufficient stock
 price history over the expected term. 

Risk-free
 interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect
 at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal
 to the expected term. 

Expected
 term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected
 to be outstanding. The Company s historical share option exercise experience does not
 provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term because of a lack of sufficient
 data. Therefore, the Company estimates the expected term by using the simplified method provided
 by the SEC. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting
 and the contractual life of the options.

of common stock. of these warrants remain outstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2024 and may be exercised in whole or
in part, at any time before May 22, 2025. On December 22, 2022, in conjunction with the issuance of a debenture to Alpha (see Note 8
 Convertible Debt), the Company issued to Alpha a warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. The
exercise price of this warrant was initially , and may be exercised in whole or in part, on or after June 22, 2023 and at any time

Agreement, with Alpha. This Amendment reduced the Exercise Price of the December 22, 2022 warrant from per share to per share.
The Amendment also revised certain provisions of the warrant which resulted in reclassification of the warrant from liabilities to equity. 

On
February 27, 2024 the Company entered into a new Securities Purchase Agreement with Alpha for the purchase of the February 2024 Debenture

22, 2022 warrant and the May 2020 warrant from per share to per share. The company recognized a deemed dividend of ,
which represents the incremental fair value of the outstanding warrants as a result of the down-round provision. As the Company has an
accumulated deficit, the deemed dividend was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital, resulting in a net impact of zero
to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, on February
27, 2024, the Company issued to Alpha a warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of
 per share, which may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time before February 27, 2029. 

On
September 6, 2024 as a result of the down-round provision triggered by shares sold in a public offering, the above warrants were repriced from per share exercise price to per share exercise price. The company recognized an additional deemed dividend of

has an accumulated deficit, the deemed dividend was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital, resulting in a net impact
of zero to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report and the audited financial statements
and notes thereto as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 5, 2024. As used in this Quarterly Report, unless the context
suggests otherwise, we, us, our, or Qualigen refer to Qualigen Therapeutics,
Inc. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties
and assumptions. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements by the Company that involve risks and uncertainties and reflect the Company s
judgment as of the date of this Report. These statements generally relate to future events or the Company s future financial or
operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, 
 will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, 
 intends, target, or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions
that concern the Company s expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Such forward-looking statements may relate to, among other
things, potential future development, testing and launch of products and product candidates. Actual events or results may differ from
our expectations due to a number of factors. 

Some
of the factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated or predicted include: 

our
 ability to procure sufficient working capital to continue and complete the development, testing
 and launch of our prospective drug products; 

our
 ability to successfully develop any drugs; 

our
 ability to progress our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical development;	 

our
 ability to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our clinical trials and to begin
 and complete such trials according to any projected timeline; 

our
 ability to complete enrollment in our clinical trials as contemplated by any projected timeline;	 

the
 likelihood that future clinical trial data will be favorable or that such trials will confirm
 any improvements over other products or lack negative impacts; 

our
 ability to successfully commercialize any drugs; 

the
 likelihood that patents will issue on our in-licensed patent applications; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property; and 

our
 ability to compete. 

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics, and healthcare,
regulatory and scientific developments and depend on the economic circumstances that may or may not occur in the future or may occur
on longer or shorter timelines than anticipated. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should
not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each
forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which
we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. In addition, even if our results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent in some future
periods with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, they may not be predictive of results or developments
in other future periods. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this Quarterly Report speaks only as of the date of this Quarterly
Report, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements beyond the date of this Quarterly Report,
except as required by law. This caution is made under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

Future
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), future press releases and future oral or written statements
made by us or with our approval, which are not statements of historical fact, may also contain forward-looking statements. Because such
statements include risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, actual results may differ materially from those expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we
undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they
are made.

Overview 

We
are an early-clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for adult and pediatric cancer. Our business now consists
of one early-clinical-stage therapeutic program (QN-302) and one preclinical therapeutic program (Pan-RAS). 

Our
lead program, QN-302, is an investigational small molecule G-quadruplexes (G4)-selective transcription inhibitor with strong binding
affinity to G4s prevalent in cancer cells (such as pancreatic cancer). Such binding could, by stabilizing the G4s against DNA unwinding, 
help inhibit cancer cell proliferation. QN-302 is undergoing a Phase 1a clinical trial at START Midwest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and
HonorHealth in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

Our
Pan-RAS program, which is currently at the preclinical stage, consists of a family of RAS oncogene protein-protein interaction inhibitor
small molecules believed to inhibit or block mutated RAS genes proteins from binding to their effector proteins thereby leaving
the proteins from the mutated RAS unable to cause further harm. In theory, such mechanism of action may be effective in the treatment
of about one quarter of all cancers, including certain forms of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers. The investigational compounds
within our Pan-RAS portfolio are designed to suppress the interaction of endogenous RAS with c-RAF, upstream of the KRAS, HRAS and NRAS
effector pathways. 

We
do not expect to be profitable before products from our therapeutics pipeline are commercialized. To experience losses while therapeutic
products are still under development is, of course, typical for biotechnology companies. 

In
addition, under a Co-Development Agreement dated April 11, 2024 with Marizyme, Inc. Marizyme ), we are entitled to receive
quarterly a 33 payment in the nature of royalties (capped at double the amount of Funding Payment cash we provide to Marizyme) on any
Net Sales (as defined with a meaning tantamount to gross profit on net sales) of Marizyme s DuraGraft vascular conduit solution,
which is indicated for adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries and is intended for the flushing and storage
of the saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties would accrue
until after DuraGraft has been launched in the United States and a cumulative total of 500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have been made
in the United States. To date we have provided 1,750,000 of Funding Payments to Marizyme (inclusive of a 1,250,000 demand promissory
note dated July 15, 2024 which bears interest at 18 per annum). 

Recent
Developments 

Marizyme 

On
April 11, 2024, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with Marizyme. Under the Co-Development Agreement (as amended on August 6,
2024), we agreed to pay Marizyme a Funding Payment of up to 1,750,000 and an Exclusivity Fee of 200,000. The Exclusivity Fee of 200,000
and a Funding Payment of 500,000 was paid to Marizyme on April 12, 2024. The Exclusivity Fee entitles us to an exclusivity period until
May 31, 2024 for purposes of proposing and outlining a broader strategic relationship with Marizyme with regard to Marizyme s DuraGraft
business. The Funding Payment is designed to provide financial support for commercialization of Marizyme s DuraGraft vascular
conduit solution, which is indicated for adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries and is intended for the
flushing and storage of the saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. In return for the Funding Payment
we will receive quarterly a 33 payment in the nature of royalties on any Net Sales (as defined with a meaning tantamount to gross profit
on net sales) of DuraGraft, capped at double the amount of the Funding Payment cash provided. No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties
would accrue until after DuraGraft has been launched in the United States and a cumulative total of 500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have
been made in the United States. 

On
July 15, 2024, the Company advanced 1,250,000 to Marizyme, Inc., a Nevada corporation Marizyme ), against which Marizyme
had previously delivered its demand promissory note to the Company of like principal amount dated July 12, 2024 (the Marizyme
Note ). The Marizyme Note bears interest the rate of eighteen percent (18 per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of
the outstanding principal or interest of the Marizyme Note at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements historically have not separated our diagnostics-related activities from our therapeutics-related
activities. All of our historically reported revenue was diagnostics-related. Before the third quarter of 2023, our reported expenses
represented the total of our diagnostics-related and therapeutics-related expenses. In this Quarterly Report, all diagnostics-related
revenues and expenses have been reclassified to discontinued operations (See Note 5 - Discontinued Operations). 

This
discussion and analysis is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed
consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to impairment
of goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value of warrant liabilities, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical
experience, known trends and events and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe
that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition
and results of operations: 

Research
 and development 

Discontinued
 operations 

Derivative
 financial instruments and warrant liabilities 

Stock-based
 compensation 

Income
 taxes 

Derivative
Financial Instruments and Warrant Liabilities 

On
April 12, 2024, in connection with an 8 Convertible Debenture in the principal amount of 1,100,000 issued to Yi Hua Chen Chen (see Note 7 Warrant Liabilities), we issued a liability classified warrant to Chen purchase 36,001 shares of our common stock, exercisable
until February 27, 2029, which remains outstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2024. 

As a result of a partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture on September 9, 2024, as of September 30,
2024 the Company no longer had sufficient shares to settle the 2024 Alpha Warrant in full until shareholder approval was obtained, and
a portion (2,314 warrant shares) was reclassified to liabilities (see Note 7 Warrant Liabilities and Note 12 - Stockholders Equity). 

The
fair value of liability classified warrants will be determined each quarter on a mark-to-market basis, it could result
in significant variability in our future quarterly and annual consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheets based
on changes in our public market common stock price. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, a quarter-to-quarter increase in our stock price would result
in an increase in the fair value of the warrant liabilities and a quarter-to-quarter decrease in our stock price would result in a decrease
in the fair value of the warrant liabilities.

Expenses 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased from 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.1 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.2 million or 15 . This is primarily due to decreases in payroll of 0.2 million, professional
fees of 0.1 million and insurance of 0.1 million offset by an increase in investor relations expenses of 0.2 million. 

Research
and Development Costs 

Research
and development expenses decreased from 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.3 million or 91 . This was primarily due to decreases in QN-302 program expenses of 0.8 million,
a decrease in RAS program expenses of 0.2 million, a decrease in payroll of 0.2 million and a decrease in stock-based compensation
of 0.1 million. 

Other
Expense (Income), Net 

Gain
on Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we experienced a gain of approximately 1,000 and a loss of approximately 0.1 million,
respectively, on change in fair value of warrant liabilities, primarily due to changes in our stock price and expiration of warrants
during the current period, and changes in our stock price in the prior period. Typically, a decline in our stock price would result in
a decline in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, generating a gain, while an increase in our stock price would result in an increase
in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, generating a loss. 

Gain
on Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 we experienced a gain of approximately 0.5 million on change in fair value of derivative liabilities,
compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The fair value of derivative liabilities declined during the current period
due to changes in our stock price and a reduction in the remaining term of the underlying instruments. Derivative liabilities in the
prior period had no fair value. 

Interest
Expense, Net 

Interest
expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 remained the same. 

Loss
on Voluntary Conversion of Convertible Debt Into Common Stock 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 30,378 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately 394,000, upon
Alpha s partial voluntary conversion of the 2022 Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of 13.00. Upon conversion to shares,
we recognized a gain on voluntary conversion of convertible debt into common stock of approximately 1,000. 

In addition, we issued 7,842 shares
of common stock with a fair value of approximately 61,000, upon Alpha s partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture
at a weighted average share price of 6.50. Upon conversion to shares, we recognized a loss on voluntary conversion of convertible debt
into common stock of approximately 29,000. 

There were no voluntary conversions of convertible debt for the three months ended September
30, 2023. 

Gain
on Settlements of Accounts Payable 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we settled 395,000 of our outstanding accounts payable for a gain of 348,000. No such events
in 2023. 

Other

Discontinued
Operations 

Income
from discontinued operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0 compared to loss from discontinued operations of
approximately 160,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Of the 160,000 income from discontinued operations during the
three months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 91,000 was due to net income from our former Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary, and 69,000
in income from NanoSynex, inclusive of a 150,000 benefit in provision for income taxes. The 912,000 loss from discontinued operations
during the three months ended September 30, 2022 consisted of approximately 422,000 from our former Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary and approximately
 489,000 from NanoSynex. 

In
addition, the Company recorded a loss of approximately 0.6 million on disposal of discontinued operations during the three months ended
September 30, 2023, and 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023
consisted of approximately 4.5 million from deconsolidation of NanoSynex, offset by a gain of approximately 3.9 million from the sale
of the Company s former Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased from approximately 5.1 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately
 3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 1.9 million or 38 . This decrease was primarily
due to a 0.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, 0.7 million decrease in payroll expenses, a 0.5 million decrease
in professional fees, and a 0.1 million decrease in insurance, offset by an increase in investor relations expenses of 0.2 million. 

Research
and Development Costs 

Research
and development expenses decreased from approximately 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 1.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.7 million or 68 . This was primarily due to an decrease in QN-302
program costs of 2.0 million, a decrease in RAS program expenses of 0.8 million, a decrease in wages of 0.4 million, a decrease in
stock-based compensation of 0.1 million and a decrease in legal expenses of 0.1 million, offset by an increase of 0.7 million in expenses
under the Marizyme co-development agreement. 

Other
Expense (Income), Net 

Gain
on Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we experienced a gain of approximately 0.4 million, and a gain of approximately 1.4
million, respectively, on change in fair value of warrant liabilities, primarily due to changes in our stock price and expiration of
warrants during the current period, and changes in our stock price in the prior period. Typically, a decline in our stock price would
result in a decline in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, generating a gain, while an increase in our stock price would result
in an increase in the fair value of our warrant liabilities, generating a loss. 

Loss
on Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a loss of approximately 0.3 million on change in fair value of derivative liabilities,
compared to 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fair value of derivative liabilities declined during the current period
due to changes in our stock price and a reduction in the remaining term of the underlying instruments. Derivative liabilities in the
prior period had no fair value. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.8 million, compared to interest expense of approximately
 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, The decrease was primarily due to reduced accretion of discount on convertible
debt during the current period. 

Loss
on Issuance of Convertible Debt 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred a loss on issuance of convertible debt of approximately 358,000 due to the fair
value of the 2024 Alpha Debenture and derivative liabilities exceeding the cash proceeds. 

(Gain)
Loss on Voluntary Conversion of Convertible Debt Into Common Stock 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 58,378 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately 674,000, upon partial voluntary conversion of the 2022 Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of 13.00. Upon redemption in
shares, we recognized a gain on voluntary conversion of convertible debt into common stock of approximately 85,000. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 7,842 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately 61,000, upon
Alpha s partial voluntary conversion of the 2024 Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of 6.50. Upon conversion to
shares, we recognized a loss on voluntary conversion of convertible debt into common stock of approximately 29,000. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 1.1 million loss due to a voluntary conversion by Alpha Capital of approximately
 1.1 million of convertible debt into 16,834 shares of common stock. 

Loss
on Monthly Redemptions of Convertible Debt into Common Stock 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 45,496 shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately 903,000, in
lieu of cash for monthly redemptions of 660,000 principal and approximately 34,000 accrued interest redeemed, pursuant to the terms
of the 2022 Alpha Debenture at a weighted average share price of 14.51. Upon redemption in shares, we recognized a loss on monthly redemptions
of convertible debt into common stock of approximately 209,000. 

33 

Gain
on Settlements of Accounts Payable 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we settled 395,000 of our outstanding accounts payable for a gain of 348,000. No such events
in 2023. 

Loss
on Fixed Asset Disposal 

L oss
on fixed asset disposal during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0, compared to approximately 22,000 due to a write off
of equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other
Income, Net 

Other
income, net was immaterial during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Discontinued
Operations 

There
was a loss from discontinued operations of 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss from discontinued
operations of approximately 0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.1 million loss from discontinued operations
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated from the early settlement of an escrow account from the sale of Qualigen,
Inc. The 0.7 million loss from discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of approximately 0.2
million from our former Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary and approximately 0.5 million from NanoSynex. 

In
addition, the Company recorded a loss of approximately 0.6 million on disposal of discontinued operations during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, and 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This loss consisted of approximately 4.5 million from deconsolidation
of NanoSynex, offset by a gain of approximately 3.9 million from the sale of our former Qualigen, Inc. subsidiary (See Note 5 - Discontinued
Operations). 

L iquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 338,000 in cash and an accumulated deficit of 122.2 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, we used cash of 4.0 million and 11 million, respectively, in operations. 

We
currently expect our cash balances to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect to continue to have net losses and negative
cash flow from operations, which will challenge our liquidity. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue
as a going concern for the one-year period following the date that the financial statements in this Quarterly Report were issued. There
is no assurance that we will ever achieve profitable operations, or, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. 

Historically,
our principal sources of cash have, in addition to previous revenue from product sales and license revenues from the FastPack product
of line of Qualigen, Inc. (which we divested in July 2023), included proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity and proceeds
from the issuance of debt. There can be no assurance that further financing can be obtained on favorable terms, or at all. If we are
unable to obtain funding, we could be required to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs, product portfolio expansion
or future commercialization efforts, and we could be unable to continue operations. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we raised approximately 1.5 million less expenses, in convertible debt. In February 2024 we issued
to Alpha Capital Anstalt Alpha an 8 Convertible Debenture (the 2024 Alpha Debenture with a principal
amount of 550,000; in connection with this issuance, we also issued to Alpha a 5-year common stock purchase warrant to purchase (at
 13.00 per share) 18,001 shares of our common stock. We also granted to Alpha an option, exercisable until July 1, 2024, to purchase
from us additional 8 Convertible Debentures, of like tenor, with face amounts of up to an aggregate of 1,100,000 (and with a proportional
number of accompanying common stock warrants of like tenor, up to a total of 36,001 additional warrants). In April 2024, Alpha assigned
this option to Yi Hua Chen Chen and Chen exercised the option in full; in exchange for 1,000,000 (less expenses) we
issued to Chen an 8 Convertible Debenture with a principal amount of 1,100,000; in connection with this issuance, we also issued to
Chen a 5-year common stock purchase warrant to purchase 0 per share) 36,001 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of 6.50 as of September 30, 2024. 

34 

To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our
common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting
our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise
additional funds through third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic
alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue
streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. In addition, any future
financing (depending on the terms and conditions) may be subject to the approval of Alpha and Chen under the terms of the Debentures
and/or trigger certain adjustments to the Debentures or warrants held by Alpha and Chen. 

In
June 2024, by way of a negotiated early release of escrow, we received 350,000 from the 450,000 escrow account established in connection
with our July 2023 sale of Qualigen, Inc. The escrow account had originally been subject to release in January 2025. In exchange for
the early release, 100,000 from the escrow account was paid to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc., the buyer of Qualigen, Inc. 

The
Company and an institutional investor entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated July 5, 2024 (the Agreement ),
providing for the Company to issue to the investor at par an unsecured, nonconvertible 2,000,000 18 senior note (the Senior
Note with a scheduled maturity date of July 8, 2025. The Senior Note includes a requirement for partial prepayments from a percentage
of any future Company financings. Otherwise, principal and interest on the Senior Note is not payable until maturity. On July 12, 2024,
the investor funded the 2,000,000 loan to the Company and the Company issued the Senior Note to the investor. 

Delisting
of our common stock from Nasdaq would have a serious negative effect on any future financing efforts. A hearing before a Nasdaq
Hearing Panel was held on July 16, 2024. On August 2, 2024, the Company received the Panel decision which granted the Company an
extension until November 19, 2024 to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule and the Equity Rule. If the Company is unable to
regain compliance with the listing standards of Nasdaq by November 19, 2024, the Company s securities may be delisted from The
Nasdaq Stock Market. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern, and therefore, be required to liquidate
its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts that may differ from those reflected
in the accompanying financial statements. 

Our
current liabilities at September 30, 2024 include approximately 1.6 million of accounts payable, 1.9 million of convertible debt and
derivative liabilities, 0.6 million of accrued expenses and other current liabilities, 0.3 million in warrant liabilities. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

We
have no material contractual obligations that are not fully recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed
in the notes to the financial statements. 

License
and Sponsored Research Agreements 

We
have obligations under various license and sponsored research agreements to make future payments to third parties that become due and
payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing
for product approval with the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, product launch
or product sales) or on the sublicense of our rights to another party. We have not included these commitments on our balance sheet because
the achievement and timing of these events is not determinable. Certain milestones are in advance of receipt of revenue from the sale
of products and, therefore, we may require additional debt or equity capital to make such payments. 

We
have multiple license agreements with ULRF. Under these agreements, we have taken over development, regulatory approval and commercialization
of various drug compounds from ULRF and are responsible for maintenance of the related intellectual property portfolio. Under the terms
of these agreements, we are required to make patent maintenance payments and payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial
milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate milestone payments we may be obligated
to make per product are 5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual
property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum
floor in the low single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, but we will be required to pay ULRF
a percentage of any sublicense income. 

In
January 2022, we entered into a License Agreement with UCL Business Limited to obtain an exclusive worldwide in-license of a genomic
quadruplex (G4)-selective transcription inhibitor drug development program which had been developed at University College London, including
lead and back-up compounds, preclinical data and a patent estate. (UCL Business Limited is the commercialization company for University
College London.) We are further developing the program s lead compound under the name QN-302. The License Agreement requires (if
and when applicable) tiered royalty payments in the low to mid-single digits, clinical/regulatory/sales milestone payments, and sharing
of a percentage of any non-royalty sublicensing consideration paid to the Company. In November 2023, we became obligated to pay 100,000
to UCL Business Limited upon the first patient dosing of QN-302, which was paid in January 2024. 

35 

2022
Convertible Debenture 

On
December 22, 2022, we issued to Alpha an 8 Senior Convertible Debenture in the aggregate principal amount of 3,300,000 for a
purchase price of 3,000,000 pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated December 21, 2022 (the 2022
Securities Purchase Agreement ). The 2022 Debenture has a maturity date of December 22, 2025 and is convertible, at any time,
and from time to time, until the 2022 Debenture is no longer outstanding, at Alpha s option, into shares of our common stock
(the Conversion Shares ), at a price initially equal to 1.32 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2022
Debenture and other terms and conditions described in the 2022 Debenture. On July 13, 2023, we obtained stockholder approval, for
purposes of complying with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), for the issuance to Alpha of more than 20 of our issued and outstanding
shares of common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of (a) the 2022 Debenture, and (b) the common stock purchase warrant
dated December 22, 2022 issued by us to Alpha. Between January 9 - 12, 2023, we issued 16,834 shares of common stock upon
Alpha s partial conversion of the 2022 Debenture at 66.00 per share for a total of 1,111,078 in principal. In October and
December 2023, we issued 6,193 shares of common stock to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments on the 2022 Debenture
at a weighted average price of 35.52 per share. During the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, we issued
30,378 and 103,865 shares of common stock, respectively to Alpha in lieu of cash for monthly redemption payments on and
voluntary conversions of the 2022 Debenture at a weighted average conversion price of 13.00 and 13.66 per share, respectively, and a weighted average fair
value of 12.97 and 15.19 per share, respectively. 

2024
Convertible Debentures 

On
February 27, 2024, upon our receipt of a cash purchase price payment of 500,000 (less expenses), we issued to Alpha an 8 Convertible
Debenture (the 2024 Alpha Debenture in the principal amount of 550,000. The 2024 Alpha Debenture matures no later than
December 31, 2024 and is convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Alpha s option, into shares of common stock of the
Company, at 30.56 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the 2024 Alpha Debenture. Except in respect of an Exempt Issuance,
the 2024 Alpha Debenture contains a ratchet antidilution provision, with a 5.82 per share floor. The 2024 Alpha Debenture accrues
interest on its outstanding principal balance at the rate of 8 per annum, payable at maturity. In connection with this issuance, we
also issued to Alpha a 5-year common stock purchase warrant to purchase 18,001 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of 6.50 per share as of September 30, 2024. 

We
also granted to Alpha an option, exercisable until July 1, 2024, to purchase from us additional 8 Convertible Debentures, of like tenor,
with face amounts of up to an aggregate of 1,100,000 (and with a proportional number of accompanying common stock warrants of like tenor,
up to a total of 36,002 additional warrants). On April 11, 2024, Alpha assigned this option to Yi Hua Chen, who exercised it in full
on April 12, 2024 (see Note 8 - Convertible Debt to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements). 

NanoSynex
Funding Agreement 

As
a condition to our acquisition of a majority voting equity interest in NanoSynex from Alpha and NanoSynex, we entered into a Master Agreement
for the Operational and Technological Funding of NanoSynex (the Funding Agreement ), on May 26, 2022, pursuant to which
we agreed to fund NanoSynex up to an aggregate of approximately 10.4 million, subject to NanoSynex s achievement of certain performance
milestones specified in the Funding Agreement and the satisfaction of other terms and conditions described in the Funding Agreement. 

On
July 20, 2023, we entered into the NanoSynex Amendment, which amended the Funding Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to,
among other things, forfeit 281,000 Series B Preferred Shares of NanoSynex held by the Company, resulting in our ownership in NanoSynex
being reduced from approximately 52.8 to approximately 49.97 of the voting equity of NanoSynex. In addition, we agreed to cancel approximately
 3.0 million of promissory notes which NanoSynex had issued to us under the NanoSynex Funding Agreement, relieving NanoSynex of any repayment
obligations to us with respect to such notes. The surrender of shares reducing our interest in NanoSynex from approximately 52.8 to
approximately 49.97 occurred on July 20, 2023. Accordingly, NanoSynex was deconsolidated from our financial statements as of July 20,
2023, and is reported as Discontinued Operations in this Quarterly Report. 

The
NanoSynex Amendment superseded any payment obligations contemplated by the original Funding Agreement and amended our obligations to
provide funding to NanoSynex, except we agreed to provide future funding as follows: (i) 560,000 on or before November 30, 2023, and
(ii) 670,000 on or before March 31, 2024, in each case issued in the form of a promissory note to the Company with a face value in the
amount of such funding. However, on November 22, 2023, in full settlement of any additional funding obligations to NanoSynex, we forfeited
certain of our shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of NanoSynex in an amount that reduced our ownership in NanoSynex from approximately
49.97 to 39.90 . Our investment in NanoSynex will be accounted as an equity method investment prospectively from the July 20, 2023 deconsolidation
date. 

36 

Marizyme 

On
April 11, 2024, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with Marizyme, Inc. Marizyme ). Under the Co-Development Agreement
(as amended on August 6, 2024), we agreed to pay Marizyme a Funding Payment of up to 1,750,000 and an Exclusivity Fee of 200,000. The
Exclusivity Fee of 200,000 and a Funding Payment of 500,000 was paid to Marizyme on April 12, 2024. The Exclusivity Fee entitled us
to an exclusivity period until May 31, 2024 for purposes of proposing and outlining a broader strategic relationship with Marizyme with
regard to Marizyme s DuraGraft business. The Funding Payment is designed to provide financial support for commercialization of
Marizyme s DuraGraft vascular conduit solution, which is indicated for adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting surgeries and is intended for the flushing and storage of the saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery. In return for the Funding Payment we will receive quarterly a 33 payment in the nature of royalties on any Net Sales (as defined
with a meaning tantamount to gross profit on net sales) of DuraGraft, capped at double the amount of the Funding Payment cash provided.
No such payments-in-the-nature-of-royalties would accrue until after DuraGraft has been launched in the United States and a cumulative
total of 500,000 of DuraGraft Net Sales have been made in the United States. 

On
July 15, 2024, the Company advanced to Marizyme, Inc., a Nevada corporation Marizyme 1,250,000 against which Marizyme
had previously delivered its demand promissory note to the Company of like principal amount dated July 12, 2024 (the Marizyme
Note ). The Marizyme Note bears interest the rate of eighteen percent (18 per annum. Marizyme may pre-pay all or any part of
the outstanding principal or interest of the Marizyme Note at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty. 

Other
Service Agreements 

We
enter into contracts in the normal course of business, including with clinical sites, contract research organizations, and other professional
service providers for the conduct of clinical trials, contract manufacturers for the production of our product candidates, contract research
service providers for preclinical research studies, professional consultants for expert advice and vendors for the sourcing of clinical
and laboratory supplies and materials. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts.

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, due to the material weakness
described below, our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that
the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a disclosure controls system, no matter
how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls system are met, and
no evaluation of disclosure controls can provide absolute assurance that all disclosure control issues, if any, within a company have
been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As of December 31, 2023, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework, or 2013 Framework. In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
we identified material weaknesses related to a lack of sufficient number of personnel within our accounting function to adequately segregate
duties, and we have not designed and implemented effective Information Technology General Controls ITGC related to access
controls to financial accounting systems. We lack the resources to employ additional personnel to help mitigate these material weaknesses
and we foresee that these material weaknesses will not be remediated until we receive additional funding to support our accounting department.
We cannot assure you that these or other measures will fully remediate the material weakness in a timely manner. 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting in the third quarter of 2024. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weakness, our management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Nonetheless, we also believe that an internal control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met, and no evaluation of internal
control can provide absolute assurance that all internal control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company are detected.
