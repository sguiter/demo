 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

. The development of pharmaceuticals with the objective of obtaining approval by the FDA and other
international regulatory authorities is not a short-term endeavor for any specific drug candidate. It also requires extremely significant
amounts of capital funding for clinical trials and other matters. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of
 . The Company will require significant additional capital to fund the implementation and execution of its business plan. This
capital, which likely will be millions of dollars for a single drug candidate, will be required for research, regulatory applications,
and clinical trials. At the present time, the Company does not have any commitments or known sources for this level of funding. These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Note
3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

If
the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability. 

Level
3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
assets or liabilities fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs. 

When
the Company changes its valuation inputs for measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value, either due to changes in current
market conditions or other factors, it may need to transfer those assets or liabilities to another level in the hierarchy based on the
new inputs used. The Company recognizes these transfers at the end of the reporting period that the transfers occur. For the periods
ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were no significant transfers of financial assets or financial liabilities between
the hierarchy levels. 

As
at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, no assets or liabilities were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

notes payable - related

the Company issued unsecured convertible promissory notes due in with accrued interest at the rate of
 per annum, compounded annually. The notes and accrued interest are convertible at the option of the holders at any time into restricted

on these terms. Both lenders were also issued three types of warrants, exercisable for a five-year period, at prices of , ,
and , to purchase a total of shares. 

The
Company had recorded the conversion feature as a Beneficial Conversion Feature. The fair value of the notes was fully discounted
at the date of issuance based on the fair value warrants and beneficial conversion feature, and the expense portion of the notes was
amortized over the term of the notes. As the warrants exceeded the value of the notes themselves, the discount is the entire amount of
the notes. This fair value has been determined based on the current trading prices of the Company s common stock. Management has
determined that this treatment is appropriate given the uncertain nature of the value of the Company and its stock, and there

MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

The
following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results
of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section
includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
Certain statements that the Company may make from time to time, including all statements contained in this report that are not statements
of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as
 plans, expects, believes, anticipates, estimates, projects, 
 will, should, and other words of similar meaning used in conjunction with, among other things, discussions
of future operations, financial performance, product development and new product launches, market position and expenditures. You should
not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions. 

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended
to help you understand our historical results of operations during the periods presented and our financial condition for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This MD A should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements as of June 30, 2024. 

Overview 

We
are engaged in pursuing pre-clinical and drug development activities for certain pharmaceutical formulations that include cannabinoids.
We have filed three provisional patent applications, and acquired a license covering certain intellectual property related to a drug
delivery system. 

As
a relatively new business engaged in start-up operations and activities, we will require substantial additional funding to successfully
complete any of our drug development programs. At present, we cannot estimate the substantial capital requirements needed to secure regulatory
approvals for our drug candidates. We estimate that we will need to raise at a minimum 50,000 just to maintain our existence as a public
company for the remainder of the current fiscal year. 

We
are a start-up company with no revenues from operations. Notwithstanding our successful raise of 2,076,158, net of offering costs, in
equity capital and the receipt of 166,750, net of financing costs, from debt issuances during the period from inception to September
30, 2024 there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months without a significant infusion
of capital or entering into a business combination transaction. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenues from our research
and development activities related to our drug development projects in the near future, due to the protracted revenue model of pursuing
pharmaceutical drug development in accordance with the pathway set forth by the FDA. The Company had to cease research and development
activities due to the lack of sufficient working capital. While management continues its efforts to raise additional capital for the
Company, it is also seeking merger or other business combination or restructuring opportunities. 

Results
of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 32,004, a decrease in loss of 42,914 from the net loss of 74,918 reported for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

General
and administrative costs were 3,030 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisting solely of operating expenses to maintain
the Company s status as a public reporting entity. In comparison, general and administrative costs of 46,455 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 includes 35,000 as the value of non-cash stock-based compensation costs for common shares issued to the Company s
officers. 

15 

General
and administrative expenses, exclusive of non-cash compensation costs, were consistent during the 2024 and 2023 periods, and consisted
predominately of costs and expenses associated with the Company s maintaining its public company status. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 6,044 and 5,402, respectively, for discount related to the
convertible debt financings. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10,250, and included imputed interest
for non-interest bearing advances from an officer of the Company of 1,502. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30,
2023 was 7,521, and included imputed interest for non-interest bearing advances from an officer of the Company of 1,125. 

There
were no research and development costs for the periods ended September 20, 2024 and 2023 due to the Company s limited financial
resources and availability of research personnel. 

Professional
fees of 12,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2,860 from 15,540 for the period ended September 30, 2023.
Fees for the 2024 and 2023 periods consisted of legal fees for securities related matters and fees for auditor quarterly review and other
required tax and regulatory. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 750,000 shares of common stock to three officers for services rendered
to the Company. 

At
September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding convertible notes in the principal amounts of 65,000 to its CEO and
a shareholder; and convertible notes to Quick Capital in the face amount of 194,898 (2024) and 188,854 (2023). 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 391,751 and cash of 4,953, as compared to a working capital deficit of 361,249
and cash of 4,183 at June 30, 2024. The decrease in working capital was due primarily to the utilization of existing cash for operating
activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Substantially all available funds were being utilized solely for maintaining
corporate operations as a public company. We used 9,230 of cash for operating activities during the three months ended September 30,
2024, and received cash from investing activities of 10,000 during the period. 

The
Company had to cease research and development activities due to the lack of sufficient working capital. While management continues its
efforts to raise additional capital for the Company, it is also seeking merger or other business combination or restructuring opportunities. 

Our
ability to create sufficient working capital to sustain us over the next twelve-month period, and beyond, is dependent on our raising
additional equity or debt capital or entering into strategic arrangements with one or more third parties. 

There
can be no assurance that sufficient capital will be available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings
with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. 

On
September 17, 2024, the Company s Chief Executive Officer advanced 10,000 to the Company for working capital and operating purposes.
The advance is non-interest bearing and is repayable upon demand. 

Availability
of Additional Capital 

Notwithstanding
our success in raising gross proceeds of 2.1 million from the private sale of equity securities through September 30, 2024, and the
completion of a debt financing agreement resulting in the receipt of 166,750 net proceeds, there can be no assurance that we will continue
to be successful in raising additional funds through equity capital and/or debt financings and have adequate capital resources to fund
our operations or that any additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or in amounts required by us. We estimate that
we will require at a minimum 50,000 just to maintain our existence as a public company for the remainder of the current fiscal year. 

Any
additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior
to those of existing holders of our shares of Common Stock. Debt or equity financing may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant
interest costs.

Capital
Expenditure Plan During the Next Twelve Months 

Through
September 30, 2024, we raised approximately 2.1 million, in equity capital (including exercised warrants) and 166,750, net, in debt
financings, and we may be expected to require a minimum of 50,000 in capital during the remainder of the current fiscal year to continue
our existence as a public company. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising capital in sufficient
amounts and/or at terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company. Any revenues are expected to come from our drug development projects,
which will take several years if successful. As a result, we will continue to incur operating losses unless and until we have obtained
regulatory approval with respect to one of our drug development projects and commence to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our operating
expenses. There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval and the market will adopt our future drugs. In the event
that we are not able to successfully: (i) raise equity capital and/or debt financing; or (ii) market our drugs after obtaining regulatory
approval, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, while management
continues its efforts to raise additional capital for the Company, it is also seeking merger or other business combination or restructuring
opportunities. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

Our
registered independent auditors have issued an opinion on our financial statements as of June 30, 2024 which includes a statement describing
our going concern status. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve
months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated
any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin marketing any drugs that we successfully develop. Accordingly, we must raise
capital from sources other than the actual sale from any drugs that we develop. We must raise capital to continue our drug development
activities and stay in business. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

At
September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation
S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

In
February 2018, we obtained a worldwide exclusive license with respect to a proprietary delivery system for cannabinoid-based medications.
We paid 65,000 in cash to the licensor pursuant to the terms of the agreement and issued shares of our common stock, valued at 35,000,
as final payment due in August 2019. We are required to pay milestone payments upon obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceutical licensed
products and royalties based upon sales of licensed products. We may grant sublicenses under the terms of the agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies

significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and are included elsewhere

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures. 

As

effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act. Based upon the evaluation of these controls and procedures as provided under the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
