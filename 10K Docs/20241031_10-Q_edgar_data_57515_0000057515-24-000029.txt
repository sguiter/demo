 million at any one time, with potential to expand the total credit availability to million based on consent of the issuing banks and certain other conditions. The Facility expires on , and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable. Interest is variable based upon formulas tied to SOFR or an alternate base rate defined in the Facility. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our then-applicable consolidated leverage ratio. Loans may be used for general corporate purposes. Due to the nature of its terms, when we have outstanding borrowings under the Facility, they will be classified as long-term debt. 
 The Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, asset sales and acquisitions. There are two principal financial covenants: an interest expense test that requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio not less than to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter; and an indebtedness test that requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio not greater than to 1, subject to certain exceptions. The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated EBIT by Consolidated Interest Expense, and the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated Net Debt by Consolidated EBITDA. All financial terms used in the covenant calculations are defined more specifically in the Facility. 
 At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had borrowings outstanding under the Facility. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had million and million, respectively, of standby letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amount available for borrowing under the Facility. We paid interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Unless otherwise noted, references to year pertain to our fiscal year; for example, 2025 refers to fiscal 2025, which is the period from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, all included elsewhere in this report, and our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and financial performance. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to these factors. For more information, see the section below entitled Forward-Looking Statements. 
 OVERVIEW 
 Business Overview 
 Lancaster Colony Corporation is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice channels. 
 Our financial results are presented as two reportable segments: Retail and Foodservice. Costs that are directly attributable to either Retail or Foodservice are charged directly to the appropriate segment. Costs that are deemed to be indirect, excluding corporate expenses and other unusual significant transactions, are allocated to the two reportable segments using a reasonable methodology that is consistently applied. 
 Over 95 of our products are sold in the United States. Foreign operations and export sales have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the future based upon existing operations. We do not have any fixed assets located outside of the United States. 
 Our business has the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as: 
 leading Retail market positions in several product categories with a high-quality perception; 
 recognized innovation in Retail products; 
 a broad customer base in both Retail and Foodservice accounts; 
 well-regarded culinary expertise among Foodservice customers; 
 long-standing Foodservice customer relationships that help to support strategic licensing opportunities in Retail; 
 demonstrated success with strategic licensing programs in Retail through both new and established relationships in the foodservice industry; 
 recognized leadership in Foodservice product development; 
 experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions; and 
 historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities. 
 Our goal is to grow both Retail and Foodservice segment sales over time by: 
 introducing new products and expanding distribution; 
 leveraging the strength of our Retail brands to increase current product sales; 
 expanding Retail growth through strategic licensing agreements; 
 continuing to rely upon the strength of our reputation in Foodservice product development and quality; and 
 acquiring complementary businesses. 
 With respect to long-term growth, we continually evaluate the future opportunities and needs for our business specific to our plant infrastructure, IT platforms and other initiatives to support and strengthen our operations. Recent examples of resulting investments include: 
 a significant capacity expansion project for our Marzetti dressing and sauce facility in Horse Cave, Kentucky that reached substantial completion in March 2023; and 
 our enterprise resource planning system ERP project and related initiatives, Project Ascent, that reached completion of the implementation phase in August 2023. 
 Project Ascent entailed the replacement of our primary customer and manufacturing transactional systems, warehousing systems, and financial systems with an integrated SAP S/4HANA system. Implementation of this system began in July 2022 and continued throughout fiscal 2023. Customer fulfillment levels remained strong before and after the initial system cutover with no unplanned disruptions in receiving orders, producing products or shipping orders. During fiscal 2023, we progressed through our ERP implementation with no major disruptions. We completed the final wave of the implementation phase in August 2023 as planned and have shifted our focus towards leveraging the capabilities of our new ERP system.

RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS 
 (Dollars in thousands, 
 except per share data) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net Sales 466,558 461,572 4,986 1.1 Cost of Sales 355,734 352,850 2,884 0.8 Gross Profit 110,824 108,722 2,102 1.9 Gross Margin 23.8 23.6 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 54,960 51,947 3,013 5.8 Operating Income 55,864 56,775 (911) (1.6) Operating Margin 12.0 12.3 Other, Net 2,019 857 1,162 135.6 Income Before Income Taxes 57,883 57,632 251 0.4 Taxes Based on Income 13,182 13,681 (499) (3.6) Effective Tax Rate 22.8 23.7 Net Income 44,701 43,951 750 1.7 Diluted Net Income Per Common Share 1.62 1.59 0.03 1.9 
 Net Sales 
 Consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.1 to a first quarter record 466.6 million versus 461.6 million last year, reflecting higher net sales for the Foodservice segment as partially offset by lower net sales for the Retail segment. The increase in Foodservice segment net sales was driven primarily by volume gains. The decline in Retail segment net sales reflects the impact of prior-year sales attributed to the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines we exited in March 2024. Breaking down the 1.1 increase in consolidated net sales, approximately 2.4 is attributed to volume/mix impacts partially offset by net pricing, including a higher level of trade spending in Retail. Consolidated sales volumes, measured in pounds shipped, increased 2.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of all sales attributed to the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines, consolidated sales volumes increased 2.7 . 
 See discussion of net sales by segment following the discussion of Earnings Per Share below. 
 Gross Profit 
 Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.1 million to a first quarter record 110.8 million driven by volume growth and our cost savings programs. Our pricing net of commodity costs, or PNOC, was close to neutral. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.8 to 55.0 million compared to 51.9 million in the prior-year period. This increase reflects higher expenditures to support the continued growth of our business, including investments in personnel and IT, in addition to higher legal costs, as partially offset by prior-year expenses for Project Ascent. 
 Expenses attributed to Project Ascent, our ERP initiative, were included within Corporate Expenses and classified separately through 2024. A portion of the costs classified as Project Ascent expenses represent ongoing costs that have continued subsequent to the completion of our ERP implementation in 2024. Beginning in 2025, these ongoing costs are no longer classified separately as Project Ascent expenses. 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income decreased 0.9 million to 55.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the higher SG A expenses, as partially offset by the increase in gross profit. 
 See discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of Earnings Per Share below. 
 14 

Taxes Based on Income 
 Our effective tax rate was 22.8 and 23.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate varied from the statutory federal income tax rate as a result of the following factors: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Statutory rate 21.0 21.0 State and local income taxes 1.5 2.6 Net windfall tax benefits - stock-based compensation (0.1) Other 0.4 0.1 Effective rate 22.8 23.7 
 We include the tax consequences related to stock-based compensation within the computation of income tax expense. We may experience increased volatility to our income tax expense and resulting net income dependent upon, among other variables, the price of our common stock and the timing and volume of share-based payment award activity such as employee exercises of stock-settled stock appreciation rights, vesting of restricted stock awards and vesting of performance units. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the impact of net windfall tax benefits from stock-based compensation reduced our effective tax rate by 0.1 and less than 0.1 , respectively. 
 Earnings Per Share 
 As influenced by the factors discussed above, diluted net income per share for the first quarter of 2025 totaled 1.62, as compared to 1.59 per diluted share in the prior year. 
 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding have remained relatively stable for the current and prior-year periods ended September 30. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SEGMENTS 
 Retail Segment 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net Sales 239,571 242,184 (2,613) (1.1) Operating Income 56,175 53,124 3,051 5.7 Operating Margin 23.4 21.9 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Retail segment net sales decreased 1.1 to 239.6 million from the prior-year total of 242.2 million. The decrease in Retail segment net sales reflects the impact of sales attributed to the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines we exited in March 2024, in addition to a higher and more normalized level of trade spending as we invested more to support our brands and launch new items. Excluding the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines we exited, Retail net sales increased 1.4 . Retail segment net sales include volume gains for our licensing program led by our recently introduced Subway sauces and expanding distribution for Texas Roadhouse dinner rolls following a successful pilot test. Our Reames frozen egg noodles also contributed to volume growth. Retail segment sales volumes, measured in pounds shipped, increased 0.3 . Excluding the impact of all sales attributed to our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines, Retail sales volumes increased 1.9 . 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Retail segment operating income increased 5.7 to 56.2 million due to a more favorable sales mix and our cost savings programs. 
 Foodservice Segment 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net Sales 226,987 219,388 7,599 3.5 Operating Income 24,309 26,633 (2,324) (8.7) Operating Margin 10.7 12.1 
 15 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Foodservice segment net sales grew 3.5 to 227.0 million compared to 219.4 million in the prior-year period driven by increased demand from several of our national chain restaurant account customers and growth for our Marzetti branded Foodservice products. Foodservice segment sales volumes, measured in pounds shipped, increased 3.1 . 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Foodservice segment operating income decreased 8.7 to 24.3 million driven by higher supply chain costs, investments in customer programs, and increased brokerage expenses, as partially offset by the beneficial impact of the higher sales volumes. 
 Corporate Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, corporate expenses totaled 24.6 million and 23.0 million, respectively. This increase primarily reflects investments in personnel, as well as higher legal expenses. 
 LOOKING FORWARD 
 Looking forward to our fiscal second quarter and the remainder of our fiscal year, we anticipate Retail segment sales will continue to benefit from our growing licensing program, driven by our new product introductions, including Subway sauces and Texas Roadhouse dinner rolls. Our newly launched New York BRAND Bakery gluten-free garlic bread will also add to the Retail segment s sales. In the Foodservice segment, we anticipate continued volume gains from select quick-service restaurant customers in our mix of national chain restaurant accounts, while external factors, including U.S. economic performance and consumer behavior, will likely impact demand. With respect to our input costs, in aggregate we do not foresee significant impacts from commodity cost inflation or deflation. 
 We will continue to periodically reassess our allocation of capital to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to our shareholders. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Cash Flows 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled 19.9 million, as compared to 35.6 million in the prior-year period. This decrease was primarily due to the year-over-year changes in net working capital, particularly accounts payable and other current assets. The current-year period reflected the unfavorable cash flow impacts of both lower accounts payable and higher prepaid federal income taxes while the prior-year period benefited from an increase in accounts payable. Changes in accounts payable were impacted by the timing of payments. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 19.9 million was comparable to 19.7 million in the prior year. 
 Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 28.4 million decreased from the prior-year total of 30.6 million. This decrease reflects lower levels of share repurchases, as partially offset by higher tax withholdings for stock-based compensation and higher dividend payments. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Under our unsecured revolving credit facility Facility ), we may borrow up to a maximum of 150 million at any one time. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Facility at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had 2.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the amount available for borrowing under the Facility. The Facility expires in March 2029, and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable. Interest is variable based upon formulas tied to SOFR or an alternate base rate defined in the Facility. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our then-applicable consolidated leverage ratio. Loans may be used for general corporate purposes. Due to the nature of its terms, when we have outstanding borrowings under the Facility, they will be classified as long-term debt. 
 The Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, asset sales and acquisitions, and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable provisions and covenants of this facility, and we exceeded the requirements of the financial covenants by substantial margins. At September 30, 2024, there were no events that would constitute a default under this facility. 
 We currently expect to remain in compliance with the Facility s covenants for the foreseeable future. However, a default under the Facility could accelerate the repayment of any then outstanding indebtedness and limit our access to 75 million of additional credit available under the Facility. Such an event could require a reduction in or curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases, reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans, or otherwise impact our ability to meet our obligations when due. 
 16 

We believe that cash provided by operating activities and our existing balances in cash and equivalents, in addition to that available under the Facility, should be adequate to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months, including the projected levels of capital expenditures and dividend payments. If we were to borrow outside of the Facility under current market terms, our average interest rate may increase and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Based on our current plans and expectations, we believe our capital expenditures for 2025 could total between 70 and 80 million. 
 Beyond the next 12 months, we expect that cash provided by operating activities will be the primary source of liquidity. This source, combined with our existing balances in cash and equivalents and amounts available under the Facility, is expected to be sufficient to meet our overall cash requirements. 
 We have various contractual and other obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain other contractual obligations are not recognized as liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Examples of such obligations are commitments to purchase raw materials or packaging inventory that has not yet been received as of September 30, 2024 and purchase orders and longer-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of services, including IT service agreements, and property, plant and equipment. The majority of these obligations is expected to be due within one year. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those policies disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 We desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA ). This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA and other applicable securities laws. Such statements can be identified by the use of the forward-looking words anticipate, estimate, project, believe, intend, plan, expect, hope or similar words. These statements discuss future expectations; contain projections regarding future developments, operations or financial conditions; or state other forward-looking information. Such statements are based upon assumptions and assessments made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements involve various important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ as a result of factors over which we have no, or limited, control including, without limitation, the specific influences outlined below. Management believes these forward-looking statements to be reasonable; however, one should not place undue reliance on such statements that are based on current expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update such forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 
 Items which could impact these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 efficiencies in plant operations and our overall supply chain network; 
 price and product competition; 
 changes in demand for our products, which may result from changes in consumer behavior or loss of brand reputation or customer goodwill; 
 the impact of customer store brands on our branded retail volumes; 
 the impact of any regulatory matters affecting our food business, including any additional requirements imposed by the FDA or any state or local government; 
 adequate supply of labor for our manufacturing facilities; 
 stability of labor relations; 
 adverse changes in freight, energy or other costs of producing, distributing or transporting our products; 
 the reaction of customers or consumers to pricing actions we take to offset inflationary costs; 
 inflationary pressures resulting in higher input costs; 
 fluctuations in the cost and availability of ingredients and packaging; 
 capacity constraints that may affect our ability to meet demand or may increase our costs; 
 dependence on contract manufacturers, distributors and freight transporters, including their operational capacity and financial strength in continuing to support our business; 
 dependence on key personnel and changes in key personnel; 
 17 

cyber-security incidents, information technology disruptions, and data breaches; 
 the potential for loss of larger programs or key customer relationships; 
 failure to maintain or renew license agreements; 
 geopolitical events that could create unforeseen business disruptions and impact the cost or availability of raw materials and energy; 
 the possible occurrence of product recalls or other defective or mislabeled product costs; 
 the success and cost of new product development efforts; 
 the lack of market acceptance of new products; 
 the extent to which good-fitting business acquisitions are identified, acceptably integrated, and achieve operational and financial performance objectives; 
 the effect of consolidation of customers within key market channels; 
 maintenance of competitive position with respect to other manufacturers; 
 the outcome of any litigation or arbitration; 
 significant shifts in consumer demand and disruptions to our employees, communities, customers, supply chains, production planning, operations, and production processes resulting from the impacts of epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns and disease outbreaks; 
 changes in estimates in critical accounting judgments; 
 the impact of fluctuations in our pension plan asset values on funding levels, contributions required and benefit costs; and 
 certain other factors, including the information disclosed in our discussion of risk factors under Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our market risks have not changed materially from those disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is 1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and 2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. No changes were made to our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are required to disclose certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will be in excess of an applied threshold not to exceed 1 million. We are using a threshold of 1 million as we believe this amount is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of such proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under Item 1A in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
