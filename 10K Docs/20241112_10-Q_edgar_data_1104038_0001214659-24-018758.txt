The Company applies the following five steps,
separated by reportable segments, in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations
under each of its agreements. 

identify the contract with a customer; 

identify the performance obligations in the contract; 

determine the transaction price; 

allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

For more detailed information about reportable
segments, see Note 11 Segment reporting. The Company generally considers completion of an agreement, or Statement of Work SOW and/or purchase order as a customer contract, provided collection is considered probable. 

Precision Logistics 

Our Precision Logistics segment consists of two
service lines, Proactive and Premium. Under our Proactive service line, clients pay us directly for carrier service coupled with our Proactive
logistics service. Terms typically range 7 days and no longer than 30 days. The Company has determined it is the principal and recognizes
shipment fees in gross revenue. Under our Premium service line, we provide complete white-glove shipping monitoring and predictive analytics
services. This service includes customer web portal access, weather monitoring, temperature control, full service center support and last
mile resolution. Payment terms are typically 30-45 days. 

Under both service lines in our Precision Logistics
segment, our performance obligation is met, and revenue is recognized when the packages are delivered. The transaction fees consist of
fixed consideration made up of amounts contractually billed to the customer. There are no variable considerations in the transaction fee,
in either service line. 

Authentication 

Our Authentication segment primarily consists
of our brand protection service line which consists of a custom suite of products that offer clients traceability and brand solutions.
Terms typically range between 30 and 90 days. Our performance obligation is met, and revenue is recognized, when our products are shipped
or delivered depending on the specific agreement with the customer. The transaction fee is made up of fixed consideration based on the
related purchase order or agreement. Warranties and other variable considerations are analyzed by the Company, in terms of historical
warranties, current economic trends, and changes in customer demand, and have been determined to be insignificant in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

anti-dilutive
shares consisting of unvested performance restricted stock units, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards,
 shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, shares issuable upon exercise of warrants, shares issuable upon
conversion of convertible debt, and shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, there were approximately anti-dilutive shares consisting of unvested performance restricted stock units,
restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and options under the stock purchase plan, shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options, shares issuable upon exercise of warrants, shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt, and

Contract Balances 

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and
cash collections results in unbilled revenue (contract assets) and deferred revenue (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance
sheets. Amounts charged to our clients become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the delivery completion.
Unbilled amounts will generally be billed and collected within 30 days but typically no longer than 60 days. When we advance
bill clients prior to the work being performed, generally, such amounts will be earned and recognized in revenue within twelve months.
These assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting
period. Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, were not materially
impacted by any other factors. 

Applying the practical expedient in ASC Topic
606, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts (i.e. sales commissions) as an expense when incurred if the amortization
period of the assets that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any capitalized
sales commissions. 

For all periods presented, contract liabilities
were not significant. 

The following table provides information about
contract assets from contracts with customers:

million which consisted of million in cash paid at closing
and shares of common stock of the Company, representing million in stock consideration. In addition, the purchase agreement
requires consideration contingent upon the achievement of earnings targets during a five-year period subsequent to the closing of the
acquisition. The earn-out consideration is estimated at million at the acquisition date, however the maximum amount of the payment
is unlimited. The goodwill recognized is due to the expected synergies from combining the operations of the acquiree with the Company.
All of the goodwill recorded for financial statement purposes is deductible for tax purposes. The Company incurred thousand in relation
to acquisition related costs which have been included in General and administrative in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Trust Codes Global is included in the Authentication segment and the results of its
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements beginning March 1, 2023. The pro-forma financial information for
Trust Codes is immaterial to our results of operations and impractical to provide.

Contingent Consideration 

ASC Topic 805 requires that contingent consideration
to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and be re-measured each reporting period with subsequent adjustments recognized
in the consolidated statement of operations. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using an appropriate valuation
methodology, typically either an income-based approach or a simulation model, such as the Monte Carlo model, depending on the structure
of the contingent consideration arrangement. Contingent consideration is valued using significant inputs that are not observable in the
market which are defined as Level 3 inputs pursuant to fair value measurement accounting. We believe our estimates and assumptions are
reasonable; however, there is significant judgment involved. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation is revalued
to estimated fair value, and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisitions are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated
statements of operations, and could cause a material impact to, and volatility in, our results. Changes in the fair value of contingent
consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates and changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or
earnings projections. 

As of September 30, 2024, contingent consideration
presented as current liability totaled thousand. As of September 30, 2024, we had
no long term contingent consideration related
to the acquisition of Trust Codes on the consolidated balance sheets. On May 15, 2024, a payment of thousand was paid for contingent consideration.

Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization 

Our intangible assets include amounts recognized
in connection with patents and trademarks, capitalized software and acquisitions, including customer relationships, tradenames, developed
technology and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation
methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
of the intangible assets. Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Except
for goodwill, we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. 

The revisions to our internal forecasts resulted
in an interim triggering event for the three months ending September 30, 2024, indicating the carrying value of our long-lived assets
including patents and trademarks, customer relationships, and developed technology may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed
an interim impairment test and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the
carrying value to the net undiscounted cashflow expected to be generated. The analysis indicated that certain intangible assets were impaired.
The Company further concluded as of September 30, 2024 the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, which resulted in an impairment
charge. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of and thousand during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 respectively, within goodwill and intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Intangible assets with finite lives are subject
to amortization over their estimated useful lives. The primary assets included in this category and their respective balances were as

Non-Qualified Stock Purchase Plan 

On June 10, 2021, the stockholders of the Company
approved a non-qualified stock purchase plan (the 2021 Plan ). The 2021 Plan provides eligible participants, including employees,
directors and consultants of the Company, the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company s common stock thereby increasing their
interest in the Company s continued success. The maximum number of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2021
Plan is 500,000 shares. The purchase price of shares of common stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option will be the lesser
of 85 of the fair market value of a share (a) on the enrollment date, and (b) on the exercise date. The 2021 Plan is not intended to
qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ).
The Company applied FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation and estimated the fair value using the Black-Scholes
model, as the 2021 Plan is considered compensatory. In relation to the 2021 Plan the Company expensed and thousand for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received thousand

On February 29, 2024, seven participants exercised
their option under the Company s non-qualified stock purchase plan, and as a result, shares were issued from treasury, with
an exercise price of per share. 

Shares Repurchase Program 

In December 2023, the Company s Board of
Directors approved a new share repurchase program to allow the Company to spend up to million to repurchase shares of its common
stock so long as the price per share does not exceed 1.00 until December 14, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company repurchased shares of common stock for thousand under the Company s current program. 

shares of common stock. The
2013 Plan is intended to permit certain stock options granted to employees under the 2013 Plan to qualify as incentive stock options. All
options granted under the 2013 Plan, which are not intended to qualify as incentive stock options are deemed to be non-qualified stock
options. 

On November 14, 2017, the Executive Committee
of the Company s Board of Directors adopted the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan which covered the potential
issuance of shares of common stock. The 2017 Plan provided that directors, officers, employees, and consultants of the Company
were eligible to receive equity incentives under the 2017 Plan at the discretion of the Board or the Board s Compensation Committee. 

On August 10, 2020, the Company s Board
of Directors adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan ), subject to stockholder approval, which authorizes the
potential issuance of up to shares of common stock. On September 30, 2020, the Company s stockholders approved the 2020
Plan, and upon such approval the 2020 Plan became effective and the 2017 Plan was terminated. Shares of common stock underlying existing
awards under the 2017 Plan may become available for issuance pursuant to the terms of the 2020 Plan under certain circumstances. Employees
and non-employee directors of the Company or its affiliates, and other individuals who perform services for the Company or any of its
affiliates, are eligible to receive awards under the 2020 Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors or the Board s Compensation
Committee. 

On March 28, 2022, the Company s Board of
Directors adopted the First Amendment to the 2020 Plan, subject to stockholder approval, which increased the shares authorized for potential
issuance under the 2020 Plan to shares of common stock and extended the term of the 2020 Plan to June 9, 2032. On June 9, 2022,
the Company s stockholders approved the First Amendment to the 2020 Plan. On April 17, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors
adopted the Second Amendment to the 2020 Plan, subject to stockholder approval, which increased the shares authorized for potential issuance
under the 2020 Plan to shares of common stock and extended the term of the 2020 Plan to June 6, 2033. On June 6, 2023, the Company s
stockholders approved the Second Amendment to the 2020 Plan. On March 18, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the Third
Amendment to the 2020 Plan, subject to stockholder approval, which increased the shares authorized for potential issuance under the 2020
Plan to shares of common stock and extended the term of the 2020 Plan to June 4, 2034. On June 4, 2024, the Company s
stockholders approved the Third Amendment to the 2020 Plan. 

The 2020 Plan, as amended, is administered by
the Compensation Committee which determines the persons to whom awards will be granted, the number of awards to be granted and the specific
terms of each grant, including the vesting thereof, subject to the provisions of the plan. 

The aggregate fair market
value (determined at the time of the grant) of stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time
by any individual during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and its affiliates) shall not exceed 100 thousand, and the
options in excess of 100 thousand shall be deemed to be non-qualified stock options, including prices, duration, transferability and
limitations on exercise. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2020 Plan pursuant to incentive stock
options may not exceed, in the aggregate, . 

The Company has issued non-qualified stock options
pursuant to contractual agreements with non-employees. Options granted under the agreements are expensed when the related service
or product is provided. Determining the appropriate fair value of stock-based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its stock option awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair
value represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and judgements.

For restricted stock units with stock price appreciation
targets, we applied a lattice approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation, which involved random iterations that took different
future price paths over the restricted stock unit s contractual life based on the appropriate probability distributions (which are
based on commonly applied Black Scholes inputs). The fair value of each grant was determined by taking the average of the grant date fair
values under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the derived service period
and there is no ongoing adjustment or reversal based on actual achievement during the period. 

As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized share-based
compensation cost related to unvested performance based restricted stock units was thousand, which is expected to be recognized over
a weighted-average period of years.

Some of the federal tax carry forwards will expire
at various dates through 2037. Generally, these can be carried forward and applied against future taxable income at the tax rate applicable
at that time. We are currently using an effective income tax rate of for our projected available net operating loss carry-forward.
No tax benefit has been recognized in the nine months ending September 30, 2024, due to the uncertainty surrounding the realizability
of the benefit. 

Utilization of the net operating losses (NOL)
carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation as required by Section 382 of the IRC, due to ownership changes of the
company that could occur in the future, as well as similar state provisions. In general, an ownership change as defined
by Section 382 results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more
than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. These ownership changes may limit the amount
of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. 

In accordance with FASB ASC 740 Income
Taxes , valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets, if based on the weight of available evidence, some or
all, of the deferred tax assets may or will not be realized. The Company did not utilize any NOL deductions for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

In addition to the base rent, real estate leases
typically contain provisions for common-area maintenance and other similar services, which are considered non-lease components for accounting
purposes. For our real estate leases, we apply a practical expedient to include these non-lease components in calculating the ROU asset
and lease liability. For all other types of leases, non-lease components are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and expensed
as incurred. 

We have operating leases for office facilities.

Overview 

VerifyMe, Inc. VerifyMe together
with its subsidiaries, including Trust Codes Global Limited Trust Codes Global and PeriShip Global, LLC PeriShip
Global ), (together the Company, we, us, or our ), is a traceability and
customer support services provider using specialized software and process technology. The company operates a Precision Logistics Segment
and an Authentication Segment to provide specialized logistics for time-and-temperature sensitive products, as well as item level
traceability, anti-diversion and anti-counterfeit protection, brand protection and enhancement technology solutions. Through our Precision
Logistics segment, we provide a value-added service for sensitive parcel management driven by a proprietary software platform that provides
predictive analytics from key metrics such as pre-shipment weather analysis, flight-tracking, sort volumes, and traffic, delivered to
customers via a secure portal. The portal provides real-time visibility into shipment transit and last-mile events which is supported
by a service center. Through our Authentication segment our technologies enable brand owners to gather business intelligence through the
supply chain, cross-sell products, detect counterfeit activities, monitor product diversion, and build brand loyalty utilizing our unique
dynamic codes which are read by consumers with their smart phones. Further information regarding our business segments is discussed below: 

Precision Logistics:
 The Precision Logistics segment specializes in predictive analytics for optimizing delivery of time and temperature sensitive perishable
products. We manage complex industry-specific shipping logistic processes that require critical time, temperature control and handling
to prevent spoilage and extreme delivery times and brand impairment. Utilizing predictive analytics from multiple data sources including
flight-tracking, weather, traffic, major carrier feeds, and time of day data, we provide our clients an end-to-end vertical approach for
their most critical service delivery needs. Using our proprietary IT platform, we provide real-time information and analysis to mitigate
supply chain flow interruption, as well as delivering last-mile resolution for key markets, including the perishable healthcare and food
industries. 

Through our proprietary PeriTrack customer
dashboard, we provide an integrated tool that gives our customers an in-depth look at their shipping activities and allows them access
to critical information in support of the specific needs of the supply chain stakeholders. We offer post-delivery services such as customized
reporting for trend analysis, system performance reports, power outage maps, and other tailored reports. 

Precision Logistics generates revenue from two
business service models. 

ProActive Service clients pay us directly for carrier service coupled with our proactive
logistics assistance. 

Premium Service clients pay us directly or through our carrier partner for our complete
white-glove shipping monitoring and predictive analytics service. This service includes customer web portal access, weather monitoring,
temperature control, full-service center support and last mile resolution.

 Table of Contents 

Products: The Precision Logistics segment
includes the following bundled services as part of our service offerings to our customers: 

PeriTrack : Our proprietary PeriTrack customer dashboard was developed utilizing our
extensive logistics operational knowledge. This integrated web portal tool gives our customers an in-depth look at their shipping activities
based on real-time data. The PeriTrack dashboard was designed to provide critical information in support of the specific needs of
supply chain stakeholders and gives our customer resolution specialists a 360 view of shipping activity. PeriTrack features
tools tailored for shippers of perishable goods, which includes the In-Transit Shipment Tracker. This tool provides details on the unique
shipper s in-transit shipments, with the ability to select and analyze data on individual shipments. 

Service Center : We have assembled a team of customer resolution specialists based in the U.S. This
service team resolves shipping problems on behalf of our customers. The service center acts as a help desk and monitors shipping to delivery
for our customers. 

Pre-Transit Service : We help clients prepare their products for shipments by advising clients on
packaging requirements for various types of perishable products. Each product type requires its own particular packaging to protect it
during shipment, and we utilize our extensive knowledge and research to provide our customers with packaging recommendations to meet their
unique needs. 

Post-Delivery : We provide customized reporting for trend analysis, system performance reports,
power outage maps, and many other reports to help our customers improve their processes and customer service outcomes. 

Weather/Traffic Service : We have full-time meteorologists on staff to monitor weather. A package
may experience a variety of weather conditions between the origin and destination, and our team actively monitors these conditions to
maximize the number of timely and safely transmitted shipments. Similarly, traffic and construction also create unpredictable delays which
our team works diligently to mitigate. If delays or other issues occur, we inform clients and work with them to proactively resolve such
shipment issues. 

Authentication : The Authentication segment
specializes in traceability to connect brands with consumers through their product. This is critical in the current landscape of increased
regulations, as well as increased counterfeit activity and product diversion. The ability to detect fraud or abnormal behavior while tracing
an item s journey from production through to the consumer s hands provides consumers and brands the assurance they require.
VerifyMe has custom software, patented technologies, and a cloud environment that combines machine learning and data science to meet the
needs of consumers and brands. In addition, the personalized consumer experience with the brand creates a connection that increases brand
perception and loyalty. 

Products : We have a custom suite of products
that offer clients traceability and brand solutions. These products are combined with software as a service or SaaS 
which is stored in the cloud and accessed through the internet. 

VerifyMe Authenticate using rare earth-based ink taggants for instant authentication of labels, packaging and products 

VerifyMe Track Trace for unit level traceability and supply chain control 

Opportunities 

Precision Logistics: Traditionally,
most shipping businesses utilize the carrier s data platform for tracking which generally informs the shipping enterprise, and their
customers, when a package is in transit, when a package has been delivered, and some level of detail of the path which a package traveled.
We believe taking the data feeds from a carrier and adding real-time visibility with predictive analytics and the human intervention factor
of our service center gives us a competitive advantage against other third-party platforms that solely rely on the carrier s data
feeds. We utilize a variety of input sources beyond the carrier s data feed. Our proprietary Predictive Analytics 
technology is fed real-time meteorology data, traffic and road construction data, and power grid information to help predict issues before
they happen. If an alert is created the shipper and our service center will work to address the issue and save the perishable product
from spoiling, saving the shipper significant costs and reducing the need to replace products that are no longer viable. We have meteorologists
on staff that track world-wide weather patterns to address predicted issues before they happen. We believe the company has two significant
areas of opportunity. First, our services are specifically designed to address the needs of small and medium size agriculture, food and
beverage companies. Second, the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries represent significant opportunities due to the enhanced tracking
and customer service associated with distribution of these products. We are focusing our sales emphasis on those industries.

Building logistics infrastructure is a capital-intensive
process as the investment is locked in for a considerably long period. Due to the current economic environment, and our cost competitive
offering, we believe companies may opt to outsource their precision logistics services to reduce their operational costs. The outsourcing
of supply chain related and other logistics operations to service providers such as ours allows companies to improve the efficiency of
their businesses by focusing their resources on core competencies. We believe outsourcing this function to our Precision Logistics segment
provides the ideal solution for all parties involved. 

Authentication: On September 24,
2024, Paul Ryan, Executive Vice President, Authentication Segment, notified us of his resignation effective December 24, 2024. On October
4, 2024, we placed Mr. Ryan on garden leave, meaning he remains employed by us but is only working for us upon request. On November 8,
2024, our Board of Directors approved closing the Trust Codes Global business by the end of November 2024 unless we can find a purchaser
for the Trust Codes Global business prior to the end of November 2024. We made this decision in order to deploy the cash generated by
our Precision Logistics segment to pursue potential acquisitions to fund growth and further invest in our Precision Logistics segment. 

Partnerships: 

Precision Logistics has a direct partnership with
a major global carrier company and has data feeds directly from the carrier into our proprietary logistics optimization software which
provides shippers much more detailed information and predictive analytics on their shipment versus a standard shipping code look up which
is provided by the carrier. In addition to relying on this strategic partner for shipping services we have a service agreement pursuant
to which this strategic partner resells our services to its customers under a white label arrangement. Under this arrangement
we provide our logistics services to our strategic partner s customers in exchange for a pre-negotiated service fee per shipment.
Our strategic partner has begun to provide its own service offerings to its customers and while we will continue to offer our Premium
services, we expect our partner will prefer to offer their solution to customers as the primary recommendation and our solution will be
offered as a secondary solution. This does not affect our proactive services, and we expect to see growth under that service offering
as we focus on providing proactive services to customers directly. 

Our Authentication segment has a contract with
HP Indigo, and a strategic partnership with INX, the third largest producer of inks in North America. We believe these partnerships can
be used to enable brand owners to securely prevent counterfeiting, prevent product diversion and authenticate labels, packaging and products
alleviating liability from counterfeit products that harm consumers. 

Current Economic Environment 

In response to market conditions and lower demand
some carriers have implemented strategies to address a potential global recession. In April 2023, the major carrier that PeriShip Global
partners with laid out steps it was taking to slash 4 billion in permanent costs by the end of its 2025 fiscal year in response to these
market conditions and lower demand. In June 2023, the major carrier stated that due to ongoing demand, it plans to ground 29 more aircraft
in its fiscal year that started in June 2024. In mid-December 2023, the carrier forecasted a low single digit percentage decline in revenue
year over year for 2024. 

We have seen a softening in demand for some services related to high-end
perishable items which seem to be impacted by reduced discretionary spending by U.S. consumers. While a recession, whether global or more
localized to the U.S., may decrease the demand for our services that are more discretionary in nature, we believe that the internal cost
cutting measures, if implemented by the major global carrier may benefit out-sourced service providers. We are working with this major
global carrier to address their small and medium-sized business clients, which we believe is an underserved market and presents growth
opportunities for our Precision Logistics segment. However, we can provide no assurances that a decline in discretionary consumer spending
will not have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonal fluctuations
in our net revenues from sales in our Precision Logistics segment. Revenues from sales are generally higher in the fourth quarter than
in other quarters due to increased holiday shipments. The seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating
results.

Consolidated revenue decreased by 169 thousand
during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. T he growth in the Authentication
segment has not materialized, and while the growth in the Precision Logistics segment Proactive services increased, this was more than
offset by the previously disclosed discontinued contract with one customer in our Premium services . The Proactive services revenue grew
9 in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. The Precision Logistics segment accounted for 98 of the revenue for the quarter.

Gross profit for the three months ended September
30, 2024, was 1,895 thousand, compared to 2,046 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The resulting gross margin was
35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross
margin was principally due to the discontinued contract in Premium services in the Precision Logistics segment which has higher margins.
The Proactive services revenue gross margin percentage improved in Q3 2024 compared to Q3, 2023. 

Segment Management and Technology 

 Segment management and technology expenses decreased
by 12 thousand to 1,329 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,341 thousand for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease relates primarily to a reduction in salaries with reduction in management. Amortization and depreciation
expense was 306 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 295 thousand for the three months ended September
30, 2023. 

General and Administrative
Expenses 

 General and administrative expenses decreased
by 400 thousand to 778 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,178 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease primarily relates to the 247 thousand severance expense in 2023 that did not recur in 2024. Stock compensation
expense was 334 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 452 thousand for the three months ended September
30, 2023, primarily due to reduction in Director compensation. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses were 5 thousand
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Sales and Marketing 

 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 24
thousand to 401 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 377 thousand for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to increased salaries and marketing expenses in the Precision Logistics segment, partially
offset by a reduction in salaries and travel in the Authentication segment. 

Goodwill
and Intangible Asset Impairment 

As a result
of a long-lived asset and goodwill asset impairment assessments performed in the third quarter of 2024, an intangible asset impairment
charge of 901 thousand and a goodwill impairment charge of 1,351 thousand was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
which represents the amount by which the net carrying value in the Authentication segment exceeded the fair value of the segment, primary
due to changes to the forecasted cashflows of the segment. 

Interest Expense, net 

Interest expense, net was 29 thousand for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Loss 

 Consolidated net loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 2,424 thousand and 930 thousand, respectively. The decreased loss was primarily related to the goodwill
and intangible asset impairment noted above partially offset by a gain in contingent consideration of 475 thousand. The resulting consolidated
loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and three months ended September 30, 2023, was 0.23 and 0.09 per diluted
share, respectively.

38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit increase
relates to the increased Premium services revenue which has higher margins as well as process improvements to increase Proactive services
margins in the Precision Logistics segment. 

Segment Management and Technology 

 Segment management and technology expenses increased
by 492 thousand to 4,189 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,697 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase relates primarily to the acquisition of Trust Codes Global in March 2023, lower capitalized labor
costs and severance expense of 129 thousand. Amortization and depreciation expense of 905 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 835 thousand for the nine months ended September 2023. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

 General and administrative expenses decreased
by 613 thousand to 2,780 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,393 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease relates primarily to the deal costs related to the acquisition of the Trust Codes Global business
of 278 thousand, as well as severance expense in 2023. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses were 65 thousand
and 23 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively primarily due to additional projects in the Authentication
segment. 

Sales and Marketing 

 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 404
thousand to 999 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,403 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in employees and consultants in the Authentication segment, a reduction in
stock compensation in Precision Logistics, partially offset by an increase in employees in Precision Logistics.

G oodwill
and Intangible Asset Impairment 

As a result
of a long-lived asset and goodwill asset impairment assessments performed in the third quarter of 2024, an intangible asset impairment
charge of 914 thousand and a goodwill impairment charge of 1,351 thousand was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
which represents the amount by which the net carrying value in the Authentication segment exceeded the fair value of the segment, primary
due to changes to the forecasted cashflows of the segment. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 109 thousand for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 127 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Loss 

 Consolidated net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 3,323 thousand and 3,392 thousand, respectively. The decreased loss was primarily related to an improvement
in gross profit and a gain relating to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Trust
Codes Global, offset by the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2024. The resulting consolidated loss per share for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 0.32 and 0.35 per diluted share, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Cash provided by operating activities was 302 thousand during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used by operating activities of 599 thousand during the comparable period in 2023.
The increase in cash is primarily due to the non-cash add backs to net loss. 

Cash used in investing activities was 353 thousand
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,080 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
in spending in investing activities related to a decrease in capitalized software costs and a decrease in acquisition costs. The acquisition
of the Trust Codes Global business was in March 2023. 

Cash used in financing activities during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, was 438 thousand compared to cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2023, of 1,277 thousand. The decrease relates mainly to the proceeds from the line of credit of 800 thousand and convertible debt
of 1,100 thousand that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

On August
25, 2023, the Company entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale of convertible promissory
notes for the aggregate principal amount of 1,100 thousand of which 475 thousand was purchased
by relating parties including certain members of management and the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024, 450 thousand is held
by related parties after one member of management left the Company. The notes are subordinated unsecured obligations of the Company and
accrue interest at a rate of 8 per year payable semiannually in arrears on February 25 and August 25 of each year, beginning on February
25, 2024. The notes will mature on August 25, 2026 unless earlier converted or repurchased at a conversion price of 1.15 per share of
common stock. The Company may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date. As of September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding on the
convertible debt was 1,100 thousand and included in Convertible Note, and Convertible Note related party on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has accrued interest expense of 9 thousand as of September 30, 2024. 

On September 22, 2022, PeriShip Global became
a party to the PNC Facility with PNC Bank, National Association. The PNC Facility includes a 1 million RLOC with a term of one-year,
which was extended to December 14, 2023. We also entered into an amended and restated loan agreement with PNC effective October 31, 2023,
which provided amendments to a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants applicable to PeriShip Global and extended the RLOC to
September 30, 2024. We entered into a waiver and amendment on August 14, 2024 which provided a waiver for a certain event of default and
extended the RLOC to September 30, 2025. The RLOC has no scheduled payments of principal until maturity, and bears interest per annum
at a rate equal to the sum of Daily SOFR plus 2.85 with monthly interest payments. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings under
the RLOC. 

The PNC Facility also includes a four-year Term
Note for 2 million which matures in September of 2026 and requires equal quarterly payments of principal and interest. The Term Note
incurs interest per annum at a rate equal to the sum of Daily SOFR plus 3.1 . The RLOC and Term Note are guaranteed by VerifyMe and
secured by the assets of PeriShip Global and VerifyMe. 

The PNC Facility includes a number of affirmative
and restrictive covenants applicable to PeriShip Global, including, among others, a financial covenant to maintain a fixed charge coverage
ratio of at least 1.10 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal year, affirmative covenants regarding delivery of financial statements, payment
of taxes, and establishing primary depository accounts with PNC Bank, and restrictive covenants regarding dispositions of property, acquisitions,
incurrence of additional indebtedness or liens, investments and transactions with affiliates. PeriShip Global is also restricted from
paying dividends or making other distributions or payments on its capital stock if an event of default (as defined in the PNC Facility)
has occurred or would occur upon such declaration of dividend.

 Table of Contents 

Of the proceeds of 2.0 million from the Term
Note, we used 1.8 million to settle debt outstanding issued in connection with the PeriShip Global acquisition, including the redemption
of 61,000 shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, our short-term debt outstanding under the Term Note was 0.5 million and
total long-term debt outstanding under the Term Note was 0.5 million. 

Effective October 17, 2022, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement, with a notional amount of 1,958 thousand, effectively fixing the interest rate on our outstanding debt
at 7.602 . 

In December 2023, the Company s Board of
Directors approved a new share repurchase program to allow the Company to spend up to 0.5 million to repurchase shares of its common
stock so long as the price per share does not exceed 1.00 until December 14, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company repurchased 1,000 shares of common stock for 1 thousand under the Company s current program. 

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents
will fund our operations for the next 12 months. We may issue additional debt or equity as we grow
our business which we expect to grow organically, and if the opportunity arises, through key acquisitions that will help accelerate the
growth of our business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting
policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. We have identified below the accounting policies
that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require
the application of significant judgment by management. We believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies
are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences, there could
be a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Revenue Recognition 

Our revenue transactions include logistics management
for time and temperature sensitive packages, sales of our ink canisters, software, licensing, pre-printed labels, integrated solutions,
and leasing of our equipment. We recognize revenue based on the principals established in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers . Revenue recognition is made when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our terms vary based on the solutions
we offer and are examined on a case-by-case basis. For licensing our VerifyInk TM technology we depend on the integrity of our
clients reporting. 

Goodwill 

We have recorded goodwill as part of our acquisitions,
which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in the business combinations. Pursuant to ASC
350, the Company will test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or between annual tests, in certain
circumstances. Under authoritative guidance, the Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform
the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions,
data showing other companies in the industry and our share price. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting
unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than
its carrying amount. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include macroeconomic conditions, industry
and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity specific events and sustained decrease in share price. 

 On September 24, 2024, Paul Ryan, Executive Vice
President, Authentication Segment, notified us of his resignation effective December 24, 2024. On October 4, 2024, we placed Mr. Ryan
on garden leave, meaning he remains employed by us but is only working for us upon request. During the quarter, we have identified concerns
relating to the commercial viability of this segment and we are evaluating a number of strategic alternatives for our Authentication segment.
As a result, the Company made revisions to our internal forecasts and concluded that in accordance with ASC 350 a triggering event occurred
indicating that potential impairment exists, which required the Company to conduct an interim test of the fair value of the goodwill for
the Authentication segment. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined the fair value of our reporting units
using a combination of an income approach, employing a discounted cashflow model, and a market approach, employing a guideline public
company approach. The results of our goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the Authentication reporting unit exceeded
its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 1,351 thousand during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, within goodwill and intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. 

36 

 Table of Contents 

Intangibles 

We review
long-lived assets for impairment when performance expectations, events, or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying
value may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cashflows by comparing the carrying value
of the asset to the undiscounted cashflow. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable,
any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market
appraisal or other valuation technique. 

As a result, of the revised internal forecasts,
the Company concluded that this change was an interim triggering event for the three months ended September 30, 2024, indicating the carrying
value of our long-lived assets including patents and trademarks, customer relationships, and developed technology may not be recoverable.
Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test and assessed the recoverability of the related intangible assets by using
level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value to the net undiscounted cashflow expected to be generated. The analysis indicated that
certain intangible assets were impaired. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of 901 thousand during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, within goodwill and intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Stock-based Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation under
the provisions of FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. We
estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes
option pricing model include risk-free interest rates, expected volatility and expected life of the stock options. Changes in these assumptions
can materially affect estimates of fair value stock-based compensation, and the compensation expense recorded in future periods. The value
of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the
straight-line method. 

For restricted stock units with stock price appreciation
targets, we applied a lattice approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation, which involved random iterations that took different
future price paths over the restricted stock unit s contractual life based on the appropriate probability distributions (which are
based on commonly applied Black Scholes inputs). The fair value was determined by taking the average of the grant date fair values under
each Monte Carlo simulation trial. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the performance period and there is
no ongoing adjustment or reversal based on actual achievement during the period. 

We account for stock-based compensation awards
to non-employees in accordance with ASU No. 2018-07, which aligns accounting for share-based payments issued to nonemployees to that of
employees under the existing guidance of Topic 718, with certain exceptions. This update supersedes previous guidance for equity-based
payments to nonemployees under Subtopic 505-50, Equity Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees . 

All issuances of stock options or other equity
instruments to non-employees as consideration for goods or services received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value
of the equity instruments issued. Non-employee equity-based payments are recorded as an expense over the service period, as if we had
paid cash for the services. At the end of each financial reporting period, prior to vesting or prior to the completion of the services,
the fair value of the equity-based payments will be re-measured, and the non-cash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted
accordingly. Since the fair value of equity-based payments granted to non-employees is subject to change in the future, the amount of
the future expense will include fair value re-measurements until the equity-based payments are fully vested or the service completed.

Our Precision Logistics
segment relies on one key strategic partner for shipping services for our customers and as a source for customers representing a substantial
percentage of our revenues. 

Our business
is dependent, and we believe that it will continue to depend on our relationship with one strategic partner. PeriShip Global partners
with one major global carrier for all its customers shipping needs. While we work closely with this key strategic partner and have
transportation services and pricing agreements in place covering the shipping services they provide to our customers, such agreements
are subject to termination or modification from time to time. If our strategic partner is unwilling or unable to supply to us the shipping
services we market and sell on acceptable terms, or at all, or otherwise elects to terminate its business relationship with us, we may
not be able to obtain alternative shipping services from other providers on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, and our business
may be materially and adversely impacted. We do not currently have any alternative shipping service suppliers from which we can obtain
the shipping services we currently receive from our strategic partner. Establishing the necessary information technology infrastructure
and business relationship with another shipping services provider would be costly and time consuming and may ultimately not be successful
or cost-effective. Further, any increase in the prices charged by our single strategic partner or failure to perform by our strategic
partner could cause our costs to increase or could cause us to experience short-term unavailability of shipping services on which our
business relies. 

In particular,
delays and other shipping disruptions at our strategic partner significantly negatively impact our business. Our business involves the
shipment of time and temperature sensitive goods, so our customers are significantly negatively impacted by delays and other shipping
disruptions that cause product loss, spoilage and reputational harm. An increase in delays and other shipping disruptions on the part
of our strategic partner could cause our clients to seek shipping solutions from our competitors who use alternative shipping service
providers. If these events occur, it may reduce our profitability or may cause us to increase our prices. In addition, any material interruptions
in shipping services by this strategic partner may result in significant cost increases and reduce sales, which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations and may have a material adverse impact on our business. 

In addition
to relying on this strategic partner for shipping services, a material portion of our revenue has been generated through a service agreement
pursuant to which this strategic partner resells our services to its customers under a white label arrangement. Under this
arrangement we provide our logistics services to our strategic partner s customers in exchange for a pre-negotiated service fee
per shipment. Sales through our strategic partner accounted for approximately 17 of revenue of our Precision Logistics segment for the
year ended December 31, 2023, and 20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our strategic partner has begun to provide its own
service offerings to its customers, and we expect revenue from our Premium Services in our Precision Logistics segment will begin to decrease
as we experience a reduction in business for these services. If we fail to offset a reduction in business for our Premium Services in
our Precision Logistics segment through our ProActive Services or other service offerings, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

The
Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact
on the Company's financial results. 

The Company
has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of its acquisition of the
PeriShip business in 2022 and Trust Codes business in 2023. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible
assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant
changes in the use of the assets.

On
September 24, 2024, Paul Ryan, Executive Vice President, Authentication Segment, notified us of his resignation effective December
24, 2024. On October 4, 2024, we placed Mr. Ryan on garden leave, meaning he remains employed by us but is only working for us upon
request. During the quarter, we have identified concerns relating to the commercial viability of this segment and on November 8,
2024 the Company made the decision to close Trust Codes Global by the end of November 2024 unless we can find a buyer for
this business. As a result, the Company made revisions to our internal forecasts and concluded that in
accordance with ASC 350 a triggering event occurred indicating that potential impairment exists, which required the Company to
conduct an interim test of the fair value of the goodwill for the Authentication segment. The results of our goodwill impairment
test indicated that the carrying value of the Authentication reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the
Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 1,351 thousand during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, within
goodwill impairment charge on the consolidated statement of operations. 

As a
result of the revised internal forecasts, the Company concluded that this change was an interim triggering event for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, indicating the carrying value of our long-lived assets including patents and trademarks, customer relationships,
and developed technology may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment test and assessed the recoverability
of the related intangible assets by using level 3 inputs and comparing the carrying value to the fair value. The analysis indicated
that certain intangible assets were impaired. The Company recorded an intangible impairment charge of 901 thousand during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, within impairment loss on intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Impairment
charges could adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On September 30, 2024, the Company issued 60,000

November 15, 2023, as amended June 30, 2024 (the Consulting Agreement ). The securities issued pursuant to the Consulting

and all appraisement, stay or exemption laws of any state now in force or hereafter enacted. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that,

notice and a hearing prior to the entry of a judgment by the Bank against the Borrower. Interest on any such judgment shall accrue at
the Default Rate as defined in the applicable Loan Documents.

confess judgment, or a series of judgments, shall be deemed to exhaust the power, whether or not any such exercise shall be held by any
court to be invalid, voidable, or void, but the power shall continue undiminished and it may be exercised from time to time as often as
the Bank shall elect until such time as the Bank shall have received payment in full of the debt, interest and costs. Notwithstanding
the attorney s commission provided for in the preceding paragraph (which is included in the warrant for purposes of establishing
a sum certain), the amount of attorneys fees that the Bank may recover from the Borrower shall not exceed the actual attorneys 
fees incurred by the Bank.

or governmental bodies. A photocopy or facsimile copy of this authorization shall be valid as the original. By signature below, each such
Guarantor affirms his/her identity as the respective individual(s) identified in the Guaranty. 

The Guarantor hereby empowers
any attorney of any court of record, after the occurrence of any Event of Default under the Guaranty, to appear for the Guarantor and,
with or without complaint filed, confess judgment, or a series of judgments, against the Guarantor in favor of the Bank or any assignee
thereof for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, together with costs of suit and an attorney s commission of the greater
of 10 of such principal and interest or 1,000 added as a reasonable attorney s fee, and for doing so, the Guaranty or a copy verified
by affidavit shall be a sufficient warrant. The Guarantor hereby forever waives and releases all errors in said proceedings and all rights
of appeal and all relief from any and all appraisement, stay or exemption laws of any state now in force or hereafter enacted. The Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees that, pursuant to the foregoing power to confess judgment granted to the Bank, the Borrower is voluntarily and
knowingly waiving its right to notice and a hearing prior to the entry of a judgment by the Bank against the Guarantor. 

- 9 - 

No single exercise of
the foregoing power to confess judgment, or a series of judgments, shall be deemed to exhaust the power, whether or not any such exercise
shall be held by any court to be invalid, voidable, or void, but the power shall continue undiminished and it may be exercised from time
to time as often as the Bank shall elect until such time as the Bank shall have received payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations
and costs. Notwithstanding the attorney s commission provided for in the preceding paragraph (which is included in the warrant for
purposes of establishing a sum certain), the amount of attorneys fees that the Bank may recover from the Guarantor shall not exceed
the actual attorneys fees incurred by the Bank. 

REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK

The Guarantor ratifies
and confirms the indemnification, confession of judgment (if applicable) and waiver of jury trial or arbitration provisions contained
in the Guaranty, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. 

WITNESS the due execution
of this Consent as a document under seal as of the date of this Amendment, intending to be legally bound hereby.
