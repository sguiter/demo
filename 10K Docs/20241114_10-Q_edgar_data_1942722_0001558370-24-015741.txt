 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. References herein to Company, we, us, or our refer to BGO Industrial Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about our business, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and objectives. You can generally identify forward-looking statements by our use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, or other similar words. These statements include our plans and objectives for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to future growth and availability of funds, and are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to these statements involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to accurately predict and many of which are beyond our control. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and there are or may be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe these factors also include but are not limited to those described under the section entitled Risk Factors in our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-271906), which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this document (or our prospectus and other filings). Except as otherwise required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Overview We are a Maryland corporation formed on September 7, 2022. We were formed to be a pure-play industrial REIT, which will be investing primarily in stabilized, income-oriented industrial warehouse and logistics properties primarily located in the United States. To a lesser extent, the Company will also invest in real estate-related assets, including real estate debt and real estate-related securities. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life REIT formed to pursue the following investment objectives: provide attractive current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions; preserve and protect invested capital; realize appreciation in net asset value NAV from proactive investment management and asset management; and provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to real estate with lower volatility than publicly-traded real estate companies . 
 We cannot assure you that we will achieve our investment objectives. In particular, we note that our NAV may be subject to volatility related to changes in the values of our assets. We intend to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We plan to own all or substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Our board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, however, we have delegated to the BentallGreenOak U.S. Limited Partnership (the Advisor the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors.

 We have registered with the SEC our initial public offering of up to 5,000,000,000 in shares of common stock, consisting of up to 4,000,000,000 in shares in our primary offering and up to 1,000,000,000 in shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan (the Offering ). We intend to contribute the net proceeds from the Offering which are not used or retained to pay the fees and expenses attributable to our operations to the BGO IREIT Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership IREIT OP or the Operating Partnership ). The Operating Partnership will use the net proceeds received from us to make investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies. We acquired our first investment on July 7, 2023. The number and type of properties or real estate-related investments that we acquire will depend upon real estate market conditions, the amount of proceeds we raise in the Offering and other circumstances existing at the time we are acquiring such assets. We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from acquiring properties or real estate-related securities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, to make distributions to our stockholders, to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan, to pay our offering and operating fees and expenses and to pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness we may incur. We anticipate our offering and operating fees and expenses will include, among other things, the management fee we will pay to the Adviser, the performance participation allocation that the Operating Partnership will pay to the Special Limited Partner, stockholder servicing fees we will pay to the Dealer Manager, legal, audit and valuation expenses, federal and state filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution expenses and fees related to acquiring, financing, appraising and managing our properties. We do not have any office or personnel expenses as we do not have any employees. We will reimburse the Adviser for certain out-of-pocket expenses in connection with our operations. The Adviser will advance our organization and offering expenses on our behalf (other than upfront selling commissions and stockholder servicing fees) through the first anniversary of the commencement of the Offering. We will reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months following July 7, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Adviser had accrued approximately 6.7 million of organization and offering expenses on our behalf. In addition, the Adviser will advance on our behalf certain of our corporate-level operating expenses but excluding investment-related expenses and financing expenses through July 7, 2024 at which point we will reimburse the Adviser for all such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months following July 7, 2025. We intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2023. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to, among other things, distribute as dividends at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. On February 3, 2023, we were capitalized with a 200,000 investment by the Adviser in exchange for 20,000 shares of our common stock. The Adviser has agreed to not sell, transfer or dispose of such shares to any party other than an affiliate of the Adviser for so long as the Adviser or its affiliate performs an advisory function for the us. On February 1, 2024, an affiliate of the Adviser acquired 476 Class T shares, 476 Class S shares, 476 Class D shares and 476 Class I shares in exchange for 5,000 for each share class and a total of 20,000. Over time, we generally intend to fund our cash needs for items other than asset acquisitions from operations. Our cash needs for acquisitions will be funded primarily from the sale of shares of our common stock and Operating Partnership units and through the assumption or incurrence of debt. If we are unable to raise substantial funds we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. Further, we have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds. Our inability to raise substantial funds 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions. Although we have not received any commitments from lenders to fund a line of credit to date, we may decide to obtain a line of credit to fund acquisitions, to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan and for any other corporate purpose. If we decide to obtain a line of credit, we expect that it would afford us borrowing availability to fund repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase plan. As our assets increase, however, it may not be commercially feasible or we may not be able to secure an adequate line of credit to fund share repurchases. Moreover, actual availability may be reduced at any given time if we use borrowings under the line of credit to fund share repurchases or for other corporate purposes. Other potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We have not yet identified any sources for these types of financings. Investments On July 7, 2023, the Company, entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement with Sun Life (U.S.) HoldCo 2020, Inc., a Delaware corporation Sun Life and an affiliate of Sun Life Financial Inc., BGO Genesis Holding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and BGO IREIT Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of the Company (the Operating Partnership ), pursuant to which Sun Life contributed its 56.5 interest in a joint venture (the Seed Joint Venture that indirectly owns a portfolio of industrial assets (the Seed Portfolio to the Company in exchange for 13,000,000 Class E units of the Operating Partnership at a price per unit equal to 10.00 (the Seed JV Acquisition ). The purchase price of the Seed Joint Venture is equal to 130 million, which represents the aggregate capital contributions made by Sun Life in respect of the Seed Joint Venture. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated gross asset value of the Seed Portfolio was approximately 960 million (inclusive of cash on hand and the value of certain debt). The Company s 56.5 interest in the Seed Joint Venture represents an indirect 34.2 ownership interest in the Seed Portfolio. Seed Portfolio The Seed Portfolio consists of approximately 9,417,333 square feet in 29 separate industrial buildings located throughout the United States Midwest. The Seed Portfolio is divided into four assets that consist of three regional portfolios in St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Kansas City, and one stand-alone industrial property in Kenosha, which is located in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area. The Seed Portfolio was developed in partnership between NorthPoint Development NorthPoint and Northwestern Mutual between 2012 and 2023. The Company owns the Seed Portfolio through a 56.5 ownership interest in the Seed Joint Venture between the Company and a BGO advised state pension client BGO Client ). The Seed Joint Venture holds a 60.5 ownership interest in a joint venture with NP NTR Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of NorthPoint, the original developer of the underlying assets that encompass the Seed Portfolio. The existing partners, NorthPoint, Sun Life, and BGO Client, recapitalized the Seed Portfolio, acquiring it from a partnership between NorthPoint and Northwestern Mutual on September 29, 2022. The Seed Portfolio was financed with a senior loan of 560.4 million (60 loan to value ratio) at an interest rate of 4.0 in two tranches consisting of 4- and 5-year terms. The table below sets forth certain summary information regarding the Seed Portfolio.

 Sun Life Repurchase Rights The Class E units issued to Sun Life in connection with the Seed JV Acquisition are not eligible for repurchase pursuant to the Company s share repurchase plan and will only be eligible for repurchase by the Company following the earlier of (i) the first date that the Company s NAV reaches 1.5 billion and (ii) July 7, 2026. Following such period, Sun Life may request that the Company repurchase such Class E units on a monthly basis, at a price per unit equal to the most recently determined NAV per Class E unit as of the repurchase date. The aggregate amount of Class E units that the Company is required to repurchase from Sun Life in any month will be limited to an amount not to exceed 25 of the amount by which net proceeds from the Company s public offering and any private offerings of common stock for a given month exceed the amount of repurchases for such month pursuant to the Company s share repurchase plan. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Class E units from Sun Life during any period that the full amount of all shares of its common stock requested to be repurchased under the Company s share repurchase plan are not repurchased or the Company s share repurchase plan has been suspended. The foregoing description of the terms of the Contribution Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Contribution Agreement, which is attached hereto as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference. Results of Operations We were formed on September 7, 2022 and commenced operations on July 7, 2023, the date on which we acquired the Seed Portfolio. The following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations:

 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures was approximately 1.0 million due to the 43.5 non-controlling interest in the Seed Portfolio. For the period from February 3, 2023 (date of capitalization) to September 30, 2023, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures was approximately 1.5 million due to the 43.5 non-controlling interest in the Seed Portfolio. Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations and Funds Available for Distribution We believe FFO is a meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. Our consolidated financial statements are presented using historical cost accounting which, among other things, requires depreciation of real estate investments to be calculated on a straight-line basis. As a result, our operating results imply that the value of our real estate investments have decreased over time. However, we believe that the value of our real estate investments will fluctuate over time based on market conditions and, as such, depreciation under historical cost accounting may be less informative as a measure of our performance. FFO is an operating measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT that is broadly used in the REIT industry. FFO, as defined by NAREIT and presented below, is calculated as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) impairment of investments in real estate, (iii) net gains or losses from sales of real estate, (iv) net gains or losses from change in control, and (v) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. We also believe that AFFO is an additional meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. AFFO further adjusts FFO to reflect the performance of our portfolio by adjusting for items we believe are not directly attributable to our operations. Our adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impact of (i) straight-line rental income and expense, (ii) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, (iii) amortization of mortgage premium/discount, (iv) organization costs, (v) unrealized (gains) losses from changes in fair value of financial instruments, (vi) net forfeited investment deposits, (vii) amortization of restricted stock awards, (viii) the performance participation allocation to our Special Limited Partner or other incentive compensation awards that are based on our Net Asset Value, which includes unrealized gains and losses not recorded in GAAP net income (loss), and that are paid in shares or IREIT OP units, even if subsequently repurchased by us, (ix) severance costs, (x) gain or loss on involuntary conversion, (xi) amortization of deferred financing costs, (xii) losses (gains) on extinguishment of debt, and (xiii) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. We also believe that FAD is an additional meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. FAD provides useful information for considering our operating results and certain other items relative to the amount of our distributions. Further, FAD is a metric, among others, that is considered by our board of directors and executive officers when determining the amount of our dividend to stockholders, and we believe is therefore meaningful to stockholders. FAD is calculated as AFFO adjusted for (i) management fees paid in shares or IREIT OP units, even if subsequently repurchased by us, (ii) realized losses (gains) on financial instruments, (iii) recurring tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and other capital expenditures, (iv) stockholder servicing fees paid during the period, and (v) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. FAD is not indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs and does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, as FAD is adjusted for stockholder servicing fees and recurring tenant improvements, leasing commission, and other capital expenditures, which are not considered when determining cash flows from operations. Furthermore, FAD excludes (i) adjustments for working capital items and(ii) amortization of discounts and premiums on investments in real estate debt. Cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP would generally be adjusted for such items. FFO, AFFO, and FAD should not be considered more relevant or accurate than GAAP net income (loss) in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO, AFFO, and FAD should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as indications of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as indications of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO, AFFO, and FAD are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our methodology for calculating AFFO and FAD may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance 

 22

 measures, and accordingly, our reported AFFO and FAD may not be comparable to the AFFO and FAD reported by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss attributable to IREIT stockholders to FFO, AFFO and FAD attributable to IREIT stockholders:

Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation, and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares.

The independent valuation advisor reviewed appraisals provided by the third party appraisers, and the Adviser reviewed the appraisals from both the third-party appraisers and/or the independent valuation advisor. The weighted average of certain key assumptions from the discounted cash flow analysis of the respective appraisal reports as of September 30, 2024 are set forth in the following table: 

Weighted- Average Basis Exit capitalization rate 6.2 Discount rate / internal rate of return 7.1 Average holding period (years) 10.0 The Adviser has agreed to advance organization and offering expenses on our behalf (other than upfront selling commissions and stockholder servicing fees) through the first anniversary of the commencement of the Offering or July 7, 2024. We will reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses ratably over the 60 months following July 7, 2025. We will reimburse the Adviser for all advanced operating expenses ratably over the 60 months following the same date. Cash Flows Cash flows provided by operating activities of 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were driven by cash distributions received from investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures. Cash flows used in financing activities totaled 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to cash distributions to non-controlling interest. Distributions We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our taxable income, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, to our stockholders each year to comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Each class of common stock receives the same gross distribution per share. The net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable stockholder servicing fee, which is deducted from the monthly distribution per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we declared distributions of 1.4 million and 2.4 million 

 24

 of which 99.7 was distributable in cash. For the period from February 3, 2023 (date of capitalization) through September 30, 2023 no distributions were declared. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves significant judgments and assumptions and requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Our most critical accounting policies will involve decisions and assessments that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe, however, that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements will be based will be reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time, and subject to well controlled processes and reviews. Our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates will be expanded over time as we fully implement our business strategy. The material accounting policies and estimates that we initially expect to be most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below. Principles of Consolidation and Variable Interest Entities Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810 Consolidation, provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIEs. Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. We consolidate VIEs in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the VIE s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the VIE that would be significant to the VIE. Investments in Real Estate In accordance with the guidance for business combinations, we will determine whether the acquisition of a property qualifies as a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. If the property acquired is not a business, we will account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Whether the acquisition of a property acquired is considered a business combination or asset acquisition, we will recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that will be considered business combinations, we will evaluate the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. We would expense acquisition-related costs associated with business combinations as they are incurred. We will capitalize acquisition-related costs associated with asset acquisitions. Upon acquisition of a property, we will assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. We will assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. We will record acquired above-market and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Our management will review our real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impaired value. If the carrying amount of the real estate investment is no longer recoverable and exceeds the fair value such investment, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value if held for use, or fair value, less cost to sell if classified as held for sale. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material to our results. Real Estate Joint Ventures and Partnerships We will account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. We will apply the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Generally, we would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless we have guaranteed obligations of the venture or are otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, we only recognize our share of such income to the extent it exceeds our share of previously unrecognized losses. We expect to classify distributions received from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the nature of the distribution approach. On a periodic basis, management will assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment. Our estimates of value for each investment (particularly in commercial real estate joint ventures) will be based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and operating costs. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized, and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future.

 Real Estate Securities We will classify our real estate securities investments on the date of acquisition of the investment. Real estate securities that we do not hold for the purpose of selling in the near-term, but may dispose of prior to maturity, are designated as available-for-sale and are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses on all securities, except for equity securities, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. We will use the specific identification method when determining the cost of securities sold and the amount of gain (loss) on securities recognized in earnings. We will account for the changes in the fair value of the unfunded portion of our GNMA securities, which are included in real estate securities, available-for-sale, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as available for sale securities. Unrealized losses on securities that, in the judgment of management, are other than temporary will be charged against earnings as a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Equity securities will be classified as available-for-sale. We may elect the fair market value option for accounting for these equity securities and changes in fair value would be recorded in current period earnings. When the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale security is less than amortized cost, we will consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment in the value of the security. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes and may undertake a strategy to limit these risks through the use of derivatives. To address exposure to interest rates, we anticipate using derivatives primarily to economically hedge the fair value variability of fixed rate assets caused by interest rate fluctuations and overall portfolio market risk. We may use a variety of derivative instruments that are considered conventional, or plain vanilla derivatives, including interest rate swaps, futures, caps, collars and floors, to manage interest rate risk. To determine the fair value of derivative instruments, we will use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option-pricing models, and termination cost may be used to determine fair value. All such methods of measuring fair value for derivative instruments will result in an estimate of fair value, and such value may never actually be realized. We will recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We will evaluate whether derivatives as hedges qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes and therefore any net payments under, or fluctuations in the fair value of, these derivatives will be recognized in net result from derivative transactions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. We will record derivative asset and liability positions on a gross basis with any collateral posted with or received from counterparties recorded separately on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue Recognition Our expected sources of revenue arising from leasing arrangements and the related revenue recognition policies are as follows: Rental revenue will consist primarily of base rent arising from tenant operating leases at our properties. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, including any rent steps or abatement provisions. We begin to recognize revenue when a tenant takes possession of the leased space. We include its tenant reimbursement income in rental revenue that consist of amounts due from tenants for costs related to common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs included in lease agreements. We recognize acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values and the amortization of these leases is recognized over the original term of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental revenue. We will derive revenue pursuant to lease agreements. At the inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At the lease inception, we determine whether each lease is a

Table of Contents 
 sales-type, direct financing or operating lease. Such classification is based on whether the lessee gains control of the underlying asset and the lessor therefore relinquishes control to the lessee under certain criteria (sales-type or direct-financing); or all other leases that do not meet the criteria as sales-type or direct financing leases (operating). Lease revenue (including straight-line lease revenue) is only recognized when deemed probable of collection. Collectability is assessed for each tenant receivable using various criteria including credit ratings, guarantees, past collection issues, and the current economic and business environment affecting the tenant. If collectability of the contractual rent stream is not deemed probable, receivables will be written off through revenue and revenue will only be recognized upon receipt of cash from the tenant. Income Taxes The Company qualifies to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2023. As a REIT, we will not be subject to federal income tax with respect to the portion of our income that meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to stockholders. We intend to operate in a manner that allows us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we could be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions paid to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT. We would also be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless we were entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. We may elect to form wholly-owned subsidiaries to function as a taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS and file applicable TRS elections, together with such subsidiaries, with the Internal Revenue Service. In general, a TRS may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business other than management or operation of a lodging facility or a health care facility. The TRSs are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels, as applicable, at the regular corporate tax rates. We account for applicable income taxes by utilizing the asset and liability method. As such, we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences resulting from the difference between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to maintain liquidity, fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio and operations. Market fluctuations in real estate financing may affect the availability and cost of funds needed to expand our investment portfolio. In addition, restrictions upon the availability of real estate financing or high interest rates for real estate loans could adversely affect our ability to dispose of real estate in the future. We will seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets. Also, we will be exposed to both credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with interest-rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. With regard to variable rate financing, we will assess our interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We will maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our potential offsetting hedge positions. While this hedging strategy will be designed to minimize the impact on our net income and funds from operations from changes in interest rates, the overall returns on your investment may be reduced.

 board of directors has not yet established policies and procedures regarding our use of derivative financial instruments for hedging or other purposes. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this September 30, 2024 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any material legal proceedings. Item 1A. Risk Factors. For information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period from February 3, 2023 (date of capitalization) through December 31, 2023, and under the heading Risk Factors in our prospectus dated April 22, 2024, as supplemented. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, and Use of Proceeds. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell or issue any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act . Use of Proceeds On July 7, 2023, our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-271906), with respect to the Offering, was declared effective under the Securities Act. As of September 30, 2024, an affiliate of the Adviser acquired 476 Class T shares, 476 Class S shares, 476 Class D shares and 476 Class I shares in exchange for 5,000 for each share class and a total of 20,000. No other shares of our common stock have been sold in our Offering. Share repurchase plan We adopted a share repurchase plan, whereby on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we repurchase all or any portion of their shares. We may choose to repurchase all, some or none of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased at the end of any particular month, in our discretion, subject to any limitations in the share repurchase plan. The aggregate NAV of total repurchases of our shares is limited to no more than 2 of our aggregate NAV per month (measured using the aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders at the end of the immediately preceding month) and 5 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the average aggregate NAV attributable to stockholders at the end of the immediately preceding three months). Shares are repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year are repurchased at 95 of the transaction price. If we determine to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any month, shares submitted for repurchase during such month will be repurchased on a pro rata basis based on the amount requested after we have repurchased all shares for which repurchase was requested due to death or disability and other limited exceptions. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next month or quarter, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase plan, as applicable. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests and have established limitations on the amount of funds we may use for repurchase during any calendar month and quarter. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable.
