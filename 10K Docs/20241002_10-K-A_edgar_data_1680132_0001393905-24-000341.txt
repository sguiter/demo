 Forward-looking statements 
 
 Statements made in this Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
 
 Item 1. Description of Business 
 
 Cannabis Suisse Corp. (the Company , we or our is engaged in the rental of commercial office and industrial space. We currently sublease a portion of a commercial building to a third party. We lease the building from a company controlled by our CEO. Since our CEO assumed control of the Company in June 2022, we have no involvement in any aspect of the cannabis industry. 
 
 Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees 
 
 We currently do not have any employees. Our sole officer serves as a consultant to the Company on a part-time basis. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business. 
 
 Limited Operations . Our current business operations consist of subleasing a portion of a building we lease from a company controlled by our CEO. As a result, we currently have limited operations. No assurance can be given that we will have any business operation going forward that sufficiently covers our cost structure. 
 
 Lack of Operating Funds-Going Concern . We do not have a bank account. Our CEO, who is also our sole director, pays our expenses through an escrow account set up for the benefit of the Company. In the event this source of funding ceases before we are able to sustainably increase our business operations there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as an ongoing enterprise. In its audited financial statements as of May 31, 2024, the Company was issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our sources for cash at this time are investments by others, loans and advances from our CEO who is our sole director, and very limited revenue from renting. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business. 
 
 Limited Management . We have no employees. Our CEO also serves as our CFO on a part-time consultant basis. This lack of personnel adversely affects our ability to develop and grow our business. 
 
 Risks Related to our Common Stock 
 
 Voting Control is Held by One Stockholder . Our sole Director and CEO holds a majority of the voting stock of the Company. As a result, he will be able to control the election of directors to our Board of Directors and our business and affairs, including any determination with respect to mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of any assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of our common and preferred stock or any other equity securities, the recapitalization, repurchase or redemption of our common stock and the payments of any dividends. Our CEO holds convertible promissory notes which enable him to convert all or part of the principal and accrued interest into common stock. In total, the principal amounts of the notes would convert into 85,539,731 shares of our common stock as of May 31, 2024. The notes do not provide for any adjustment in the event of a recapitalization of our common stock. 
 1 

Penny Stock Considerations Lack of Proprietary Broker-Dealer Quotations . Our shares are penny stocks as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as equity securities with a price of less than 5.00. As a result, the penny stock rules apply. Such rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stocks to persons other than established customers complete certain documentation, make suitable inquires of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers is limited. Because our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities because of the requirements. Because our securities are subject to these rules it will make it more difficult to obtain needed capital in the future. Currently, our securities are not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotes. Therefore, our securities have a higher risk of wider spreads, increased price volatility and price dislocation. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be adversely affected with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 1C. Cybersecurity Risk 
 
 We do not believe we are exposed to any cybersecurity threat. 
 
 Item 2. Description of Property 
 
 We do not own any property except minimal office furniture. We lease our office from a company controlled by our CEO. We currently lease four real estate properties from companies controlled by our CEO, one of which is for the office and the others to be subleased for rental income. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Financial Statement appearing elsewhere in this Report. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Not applicable.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Background 
 
 Since June 2022, the Company has focused its efforts on real estate operations. We have no involvement in any aspect of the cannabis industry. In February 2023, we leased a commercial building from a company controlled by our CEO and subleased a portion of the building to a third party. The term of the sublease was one year and the annual rent was 30,000. Effective March of 2024, the sublease became a month-to-month lease for 2,500 per month. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
 
 Results of Operations for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenue and Cost of Sales 
 
 For the year ended May 31, 2024, the Company generated total revenue of 30,000 from renting. The cost of sales for the year ended May 31, 2024, was 30,067. 
 
 For the year ended May 31, 2023, the Company generated total revenue of 10,000. The cost of sales for the year ended May 31, 2023, was 9,166. 
 
 The increase in revenues and cost of sale is due to the fact that the Company started its renting business in February 2023. In other words, there were twelve months revenue for the year ended May 31, 2024, but four months revenue for the year ended May 31, 2023. The cost of sales increase aligns with the increase in revenue. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2024, were 256,870. The operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2024, included professional fees of 77,940; depreciation expense of 4,244 and general and administrative expenses of 174,686. 
 
 Total operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2023, were 343,516. The operating expenses for the year ended May 31, 2023, included professional fees of 278,570 which included 78,420 of legal fees, 36,200 in accounting, other consulting fees of 128,700 and 35,250 in audit fees; depreciation expense of 4,244 and general and administrative expenses of 60,702. 
 
 The decrease in operating expenses is related to the decrease of the professional fees due to significance of business activities and SEC filings in the year ended May 31, 2023. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 The total other income (expense) for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 were (929,676) and (8,865), respectively. The other expenses for the year ended May 31, 2024, contained interest expenses of 26,802, loss of 1,737,341 on the settlement of debt, gain of 100,710 on lease extension, and amortization of debt premium of 733,757, while for the year ended May 31, 2023, the other expenses contained only interest expenses of 8,865. The significant increase in other expenses is due to the loss on settlement of debt resulting from the Company prepaying for its lease liabilities with convertible notes that were recorded at their fair value, which were recorded at a premium, during the year ended May 31, 2024. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 The net loss for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 was 1,186,613 and 351,547, respectively.

 During the year ended May 31, 2024, the Company used 45,637 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss of 1,186,613 plus its gain on lease extension of 100,710, its amortization of debt premium of 733,757, and a decrease in accounts payable of 4,217; offset by stock issued for services of 20,000, depreciation of 4,244, lease cost, net of repayments of 169,214, loss on settlement of debt of 1,737,341, decrease in prepaid expenses of 22,059, and an increase in accrued expenses of 26,802.

Our sources for cash at this time are investments by others, loans and advances from our CEO who is our sole director, and very limited revenue from renting. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Leases 
 
 The Company follows the accounting for leases under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842 Lease Accounting and determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases result in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and operating lease liabilities (short term and long term) being recorded on the Company s balance sheets. 
 
 ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowings over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when 
 5 
 
 it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
 Rent Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company recognizes rent revenue from the lease of its sub-leased properties in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. The sub-lease is categorized as an operating lease according to ASC criteria for the lease definitions. Rent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, reflecting the pattern of the economic benefits derived from the lease. 
 
 The Company s leases generally have fixed rental payments over the lease term, with occasional escalations based on predetermined factors. Rent revenue is recognized monthly as the lessor fulfills its obligations under the lease agreement. 
 
 Any lease incentives or concessions provided to lessees, such as rent-free periods or tenant improvement allowances, are recognized as a reduction of rent revenue over the lease term. 
 
 For the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized rent revenue of 30,000 and 10,000, respectively, from its lease agreements. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 There have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended May 31, 2024, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.

As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the entity has limited revenues, has suffered recurring losses from operations, and has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs, therefore will require additional capital to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Restatement 
 
 As described in Note 13 - Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements, the Company has restated its financial statements as of and for the year ending May 31, 2024. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cannabis Suisse Corp. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Cannabis Suisse Corp. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Complex Debt Transactions (see Note 8) 
 
 During the year under audit the Company entered into convertible notes payable with related parties that prepaid for the leases of certain office space. The Company recognized the convertible notes payable at their fair market value which resulted in a debt premium being recognized, as well as a gain on settlement of debt after removing the associated lease liabilities from the books. Due to the related party and unusual nature of the agreements, ensuring the accounting for the transaction was challenging and required complex auditor judgment, including a detailed analysis and interpretation of accounting literature and the reliance on third party valuation experts. 
 7 

In order to audit the accounting for the convertible notes payable, we had to perform a significant amount of research and analysis to gain comfort in the accounting of the transaction. Additionally, to gain comfort in the fair value assigned to each note, as determined by a third-party valuation expert, we had to review all estimates and inputs into the valuation model for reasonableness. The detailed analysis performed resulted in material audit adjustments.

 To the Board of Directors and 
 Stockholders of Cannabis Suisse Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Cannabis Suisse Corp. (the Company) as of May 31, 2023, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2023, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company has limited revenues and recurring losses as of May 31, 2023 and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

 . The net change in valuation allowance for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 was 100,323. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. 
 
 Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. All tax years since inception remains open for examination only by taxing authorities of US Federal and state of Nevada. 
 
 The Company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling at May 31, 2024. According to current tax laws, the losses prior to 2018 can carryforward 20 years, and the losses in 2018 or later can carryforward indefinitely. The Company had losses of prior to 2018 which can carryforward through fiscal year 2036. The losses of in years of 2018 and later will carryforward indefinitely. There is a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50 change in ownership).

 On March 14, 2024, the sole director of the registrant dismissed Accell Audit Compliance, P.A. Accell as the Registrant s independent registered public accounting firm. Accell served as the registrant s independent public accounting firm since 2019. Also on March 14, 2024, the sole director of the registrant appointed Mac Accounting Group CPAs, LLP MAC to serve as the registrant s independent public accounting firm to audit the registrant s financial statements for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. 
 
 The audit reports of Accell on the registrant s financial statements for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, and 2023, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle other than an explanatory paragraph regarding the registrant s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 During the registrant s fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2023, and through. November 31, 2023, there was no disagreement(s) with Accell on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of Accell, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report, nor were there any reportable events , as such term is described in Item304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ). 
 
 During the registrant s two most recent fiscal years and through March 14, 2024, the date of the appointment of MAC, neither the registrant nor any person on its behalf has consulted with MAC with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either contemplated or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant s financial statements or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as such terms are described in Items 304(a)(1)(iv) or 304(a)(1)(v) respectively of Regulation S-K promulgated under the 1934 Act. 
 
 Item 9A(T) Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 
 
 1. We do not have an adequate control environment or proper corporate governance We have no risk assessment, information or communication, or monitoring processes in place and have no policies that require formal written approval for related party transactions. Additionally, the Board of Directors does not operate independently of management. Also, while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 
 24 
 
 2. We do not maintain appropriate internal controls We do not have formal accounting policies and procedures and have not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting. We lack segregation of duties or adequate levels of supervision and review and there are limited accounting resources with the appropriate knowledge of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or SEC experience to ensure the financial reporting is free from material misstatements. 
 
 3. We do not have appropriate information technology controls We retain copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 
 
 Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 
 
 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. 
 
 Indemnification 
 
 Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney s fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
