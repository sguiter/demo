NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation: 7 Table of Contents ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) Use of Estimates Revenue Recognition: of contract liabilities in connection to rental revenues. The Company leases land to a customer. We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. For our leases, we receive a fixed payment from the customer which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the adoption of ASC 842. In April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 on the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases. The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration. We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement. We have not agreed to any deferral or abatement arrangements with any of our customers. The Company has elected to exclude short-term leases from the recognition requirements of ASC 842. A lease is short-term if, at the commencement date, it has a term of less than or equal to one year. Lease expense related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Commission revenue For our commission revenue, we recognize revenue under the five steps in Topic 606, which are as follows: 1) identify the contract with the customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. The Company s source of commission revenue is from the Company s subsidiary Sharx in which quarterly payments are received when the customer pre-pays or pays upon the date products are drop shipped from the manufacturer pursuant to a non-exclusive distribution agreement. At such time the products are drop shipped, the Company s performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that it is an agent of the manufacturer and collects commission revenue at or before the delivery of product (See Note 3 for further details). 8 Table of Contents ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
