 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 As discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report, prior to December 2022, we maintained a million revolving credit facility that contains a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans, with an additional million accordion feature (the Second Credit Agreement ). The credit facility was scheduled to mature on May 18, 2026. The Company incurred a total of million in underwriting fees, which are being amortized over the life of the Second Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Second Credit Agreement bore interest at either base rate plus between to or LIBOR plus between to , based on the Company s leverage ratio calculated on a quarterly basis. The base rate was described in the Second Credit Agreement as the highest of (i) the Federal funds effective rate plus , (ii) the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal, and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus . We paid a commitment fee between to based on the Company's leverage ratio for the unutilized portion of this facility. Interest and commitment fees were payable at least quarterly and the outstanding principal balance was due at the maturity date. The Second Credit Agreement was secured by a first priority lien on all tangible and intangible assets and stock issued by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, subject to specified exceptions, and of the voting equity interests in its first-tier foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 On December 15, 2022, the Company entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 to the Second Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment to utilize a portion of the accordion feature, thus increasing the commitment from million to million, and concurrently reduced the available incremental accordion by a corresponding amount (the term "Revolving Credit Facility" as used throughout this document refers to the First Credit Agreement, the Second Credit Agreement and the Second Amendment, as applicable). The Second Amendment also replaced the LIBOR Rate with individualized metrics based on the specific denomination of borrowings, including a metric based on Term SOFR (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement) for borrowings denominated in U.S. Dol lars. The Company incurred a total of million in underwriting fees, which are being amortized over the remaining term of the Second Credit Agreement. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed million and repaid million under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had million and million, respectively, in our outstanding balance, which resulted in borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of million and million, respectively. The financial covenants contained in the Second Credit Agreement require the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio of to 1.00, subject to a temporary increase to to 1.00 for months following the consummation of permitted acquisitions with consideration in excess of certain threshold amounts set forth in the Second Credit Agreement. The Second Credit Agreement also requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to 1.00, the calculations and terms of which are defined in the Second Credit Agreement. Covenant compliance is tested quarterly, and we were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest payments on the first million borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility were hedged under an interest rate swap agreement as described in Note 9 until September 2024, when the balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was paid off using a portion of the proceeds from the equity offering as discussed in Note 11.

Under the current repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

 Drawing on our innovative and proven technologies, we seek to deliver solutions primarily to contractors that place a premium on superior performance and reliability. We believe our brands are well-known in the specific end markets we serve and have a reputation for high quality. We rely on both organic growth and inorganic growth through acquisitions to provide an increasingly broad portfolio of performance optimizing solutions that meet our customers ever-changing needs. We have a successful record of making attractive, synergistic acquisitions in support of this objective, and we remain focused on identifying additional acquisition opportunities in our core end markets.

We have a source of recurring revenue from the maintenance, repair and overhaul and consumable nature of many of our products. We also provide some custom engineered products that strengthen and enhance our customer relationships. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 100 well-respected brand names, such as AC Guard , Air Sentry , Balco , Cover Guard , Deacon , Dust Free , Falcon Stainless , Greco , Jet-Lube , Kopr-Kote , Leak Freeze , Metacaulk , No. 5 , OilSafe , RectorSeal , Safe-T-Switch , Shoemaker Manufacturing , Smoke Guard , TRUaire and Whitmore . 

Our Outlook 
 
 We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet in fiscal year 2025, which provides us with access to capital through our cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from our recent follow-on equity offering. Our capital allocation strategy continues to guide our investing decisions, with a priority to direct capital to the highest risk adjusted return opportunities, within the categories of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. With the strength of our financial position, we will continue to invest in financially and strategically attractive expanded product offerings, key elements of our long-term strategy of targeting long-term profitable growth. We will continue to invest our capital in maintaining our facilities and in continuous improvement initiatives. We recognize the importance of, and remain committed to, continuing to drive organic growth, as well as investing additional capital in opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns, driving increased penetration in the end markets we serve. We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, particularly as it relates to our assessment of valuation, prospective synergies, diligence, cultural fit and ease of integration, especially in light of economic conditions.

 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.4 million, or 6.9 , as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to added expenses related to the inclusion of Dust Free and PSP in the current period, including increased amortization of intangible assets, as well as increased expenses related to business integrations, strategic development activities, and employee compensation. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was attributable to revenue increasing by a greater percentage than the increase in operating expenses.

Other Income and Expense 
 
 Net interest expense of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest expense of 3.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.4 million as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to reduced average borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of strong operating cash flows generated and the repayment of the outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit Facility, as discussed in Note 7. The interest income generated by our cash equivalents invested in money market funds also contributed to the net interest expense decrease. 
 
 Other income (expense), net changed 2.6 million to net expense of (0.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with net income of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 General 
 
 Existing cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility Revolver Borrowings are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. Our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, we use our Revolver Borrowings and proceeds from the recent follow-on equity offering to support our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions. We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make scheduled interest payments on debt and meet our contingent consideration obligations. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities, primarily Revolver Borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, contingent consideration obligations and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 
 We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report contains a discussion of the recent acquisitions. 
 
 Financing 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 
 See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of our interest rate swaps. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained within this Quarterly Report. Our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements were discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report. No significant changes to these policies, as described in our Annual Report, have occurred in the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based upon what we believe is the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions. The estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
 Based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This is not to suggest that other general risk factors, such as changes in worldwide demand, changes in material costs, performance of acquired businesses and others, could not adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below. 

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 We have presented the information about pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements appearing in this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include expected restructuring charges and the results of the restructuring, financial projections, statements of plans and objectives for future operations, statements of future economic performance, and statements of assumptions relating thereto. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may, expects, plans, anticipates, estimates, believes, potential, projects, forecasts, intends, or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements that relate to, or statements that are subject to risks, contingencies or uncertainties that relate to: 
 
 our business strategy; 
 changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions; 
 potential disruptions from wars and military conflicts, including geopolitical uncertainty due to the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine; 
 future levels of revenues, operating margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; 
 30 

the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressure, including reductions on consumer discretionary income and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices; 
 anticipated levels of demand for our products and services; 
 the actual impact to supply, production levels and costs from global supply chain logistics and transportation challenges; 
 future levels of research and development, capital, environmental or maintenance expenditures; 
 our beliefs regarding the timing and effects on our business of health and safety, tax, environmental or other legislation, rules and regulations; 
 the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital, restructuring or maintenance projects; 
 expectations regarding the acquisition or divestiture of assets and businesses; 
 our ability to obtain appropriate insurance and indemnities; 
 the potential effects of judicial or other proceedings, including tax audits, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; 
 the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities, or plaintiffs in litigation; 
 the expected impact of accounting pronouncements; and 
 the other factors listed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report and other filings with the SEC. 
 
 Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements for a number of important factors, including those listed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report. You should not put undue reliance on any forwarding-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. We assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We seek to minimize the risk associated with changes in interest rates through regular operating and financing activities, and when deemed appropriate, through the use of an interest rate swap. It is our policy to enter into interest rate swaps only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Variable Rate Indebtedness 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate indebtedness. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct effect on interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness. We manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. On February 7, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on the first 100.0 million borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility (defined in Note 7). At September 30, 2024, we had 0.0 million in unhedged variable rate indebtedness as the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was paid off in September 2024. 
 
 We may also be exposed to credit risk in derivative contracts we may use. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We have sought to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We conduct an immaterial portion of our operations outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our non-U.S. operations are conducted primarily in their local currencies, which are also their functional currencies, and include the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar and Vietnamese dong. Foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions denominated in a currency other than our operations' functional currency. We recognized foreign currency transaction net gain (loss) of (0.6) million and 0.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in other expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We realized a net gain (loss) associated with foreign currency translation of 1.2 million and (1.8) million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Based on a sensitivity analysis at September 30, 2024, a 10 change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the six months ended September 30, 2024 would have impacted our net earnings by approximately 4 . This calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the U.S. dollar and that there are no indirect effects, such as changes in non-U.S. dollar sales volumes or prices. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

32 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 The disclosure contained in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. Legal Proceedings. In addition to the foregoing, we and our subsidiaries are from time to time named defendants in certain lawsuits incidental to our business, including product liability claims that are insured, subject to applicable deductibles, and are involved from time to time as parties to governmental proceedings, all arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings involving us and our subsidiaries cannot be predicted with certainty, and the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to such lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted accurately, management does not currently expect the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 There are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, careful consideration should be given to Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of our Annual Report, which contain descriptions of significant factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. 
 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report and subsequent SEC filings. The risks described in this Quarterly Report, our Annual Report and in our other SEC filings or press releases from time to time are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties are currently deemed immaterial based on management s assessment of currently available information, which remains subject to change; however, new risks that are currently unknown to us may arise in the future that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

33
