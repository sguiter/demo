 SAFE 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, Applied Digital Cloud Corporation ADCC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into SAFE agreements totaling million with an investor (the Investor ). Under the terms of the SAFE agreements, the Investor has the right to certain shares of ADCC s preferred stock. 
 If an equity financing transaction occurs before the termination of the SAFE agreements, the SAFE agreements will automatically convert into the number of shares of preferred stock equal to the purchase amount divided by the discount price, which will be the lowest price per share of the preferred stock sold in the equity financing transaction multiplied by the discount rate (90 ). If there is a liquidity event before the termination of the SAFE agreements, the Investor will automatically be entitled to receive a portion of proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the occurrence of such liquidity event, equal to the greater of (i) the purchase amount or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of common stock equal to the purchase amount divided by the liquidity price (the price per share equal to the fair market value of the common stock at the time of the liquidity event, as determined by reference to the purchase price payable in connection with such liquidity event, multiplied by the discount rate). If there is a dissolution event before the termination of the SAFE agreements, the Investor will automatically be entitled to receive a portion of proceeds equal to the purchase amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the occurrence of the dissolution event. 
 In a liquidity or dissolution event, the SAFE agreements are intended to operate like standard non-participating preferred stock. The Investor s right to receive the purchase amount is junior to payments for outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, on par with payments for other SAFE agreements and preferred stock, and senior to payments for common stock. The SAFE agreements will automatically terminate immediately following the earliest to occur of: (i) the issuance of capital stock to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of the SAFE agreements; or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor. The Investor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to its Pro Rata Share (the ratio of (i) the purchase amount of the SAFE agreements to (ii) the aggregate purchase amounts of all SAFE agreements issued by ADCC prior to the equity financing transaction) of the securities issued in the equity financing transaction, on the same terms, conditions and pricing afforded to the other investors participating in the equity financing transaction.

 Construction Contracts 
 The Company routinely engages with construction vendors for the construction of our facilities. These engagements are governed by contracts containing standard terms and conditions, including certain milestones that obligate the Company to pay as work is completed. In the event of termination of any of these contracts by the Company, the Company would be liable for all work that has been completed or in process, plus any applicable fees. The Company generally has the right to cancel these open purchase orders prior to delivery or terminate the contracts without cause. 
 Claims and Litigation 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. 
 The Company, Wes Cummins, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and David Rench, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, have been named as defendants in a putative securities class action lawsuit in the matter styled, McConnell v. Applied Digital Corporation, et al. , Case No. 3:23-cv-1805, filed in August 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Securities Lawsuit ). Specifically, the complaint asserts claims pursuant to Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly false or misleading statements regarding the company s business, operations, and compliance policies, including claims that the Company overstated the profitability of its Data Center Hosting Business and its ability to successfully transition into a low-cost cloud services provider and that the Company s board of directors was not independent within the meaning of NASDAQ listing rules. On May 22, 2024, the court appointed Lead plaintiff and approved lead counsel, and on July 22, 2024, Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint which asserts the same claims based on similar allegations in the original complaint. On September 20, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 
 The Company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in this action. If an unfavorable action were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to the Company s results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. 
 On November 15, 2023, a derivative action was filed in the matter styled, Weich v. Cummins, et al. , Case No. A-23-881629-C in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada. The Weich complaint names as defendants certain members of the Company s Board of Directors and its Chief Executive Officer Wesley Cummins and purports to name Chief Financial Officer David Rench as a defendant. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused or allowed the Company to make materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company s business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Company overstated the profitability of the Data Center Hosting Business and its ability to successfully transition into a low-cost cloud services provider and that the Board was not independent within the meaning of NASDAQ listing rules. On February 27, 2024, the derivative plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as the original complaint. 
 On June 5, 2024, following briefing and argument on the defendants motion to dismiss, the Court entered an order granting the defendants motion without prejudice and dismissing all claims against all defendants, including the Company, on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to plead (1) demand futility as to each of plaintiff s claims or (2) a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The order dismissed all claims against all defendants, including the Company. The plaintiff can seek leave to file an amended complaint but to date has not done so.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these forward-looking statements through our use of words such as may, can, anticipate, assume, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, expect, seek, estimate, continue, plan, point to, project, predict, could, intend, target, potential and other similar words and expressions of the future. Statements that contain these words and other statements that are forward-looking in nature should be read carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of future results of operations or of financial positions, or state other forward-looking information. 
 These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions, which are based on currently available information. Our actual results, and the assumptions on which we relied, could prove materially different from our expectations. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or actual operating results. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by us. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 our ability to complete construction of the Ellendale HPC data center; 
 availability of financing to continue to grow our business; 
 labor and other workforce shortages and challenges; 
 power or other supply disruptions and equipment failures; 
 our dependence on principal customers; 
 the addition or loss of significant customers or material changes to our relationships with these customers; 
 our sensitivity to general economic conditions including changes in disposable income levels and consumer spending trends; 
 our ability to timely and successfully build new hosting facilities with the appropriate contractual margins and efficiencies; 
 our ability to continue to grow sales in our hosting business; 
 volatility of cryptoasset prices 
 uncertainties of cryptoasset regulation policy; and 
 equipment failures, power or other supply disruptions. 
 You should carefully review the risks described in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on August 30, 2024, as well as any other cautionary language in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor are we able to assess the impact of all of these risk factors on our business or the extent to which any risk factor, or combination of risk factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. These risks are not exhaustive. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Business Overview 
 We are a U.S. designer, developer, and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure across North America. We provide digital infrastructure solutions and Cloud services to the rapidly growing industries of High-Performance Computing ("HPC") and Artificial Intelligence ("AI"). We operate in three distinct business segments, including, Blockchain data

Table of Contents 

 center hosting (the "Data Center Hosting Business"), cloud services through a wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Cloud Services Business") and HPC data center hosting (the "HPC Hosting Business"), as further discussed below. 
 
 Trends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business 
 Regulatory Environment 
 The regulatory landscape surrounding HPC, cloud, and blockchain hosting services is evolving rapidly, and we anticipate increased scrutiny and potential regulation in the near and long term. These developments may significantly impact our business and operations in ways that are difficult to predict. 
 In the realm of cloud computing, there are growing concerns about the ethical implications and potential misuse of these technologies, particularly in association with AI and machine learning. Governments and regulatory bodies are considering measures to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, including transparency, accountability, and fairness guidelines. 
 The amount of energy used for crypto mining and co-location services has recently received increased attention. In January 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration conducted an emergency survey of electricity consumption data from cryptocurrency mining companies in the U.S. This indicates that more focus is being placed on the energy usage of these activities. It is unclear how the information collected will be used for future regulations, but it is expected that energy efficiency and sustainability will become more critical factors regulating this industry. 
 Furthermore, using digital assets, including Bitcoin, in illicit financial activities has become a significant concern for regulators and lawmakers. Leaders in the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and U.S. Senate Banking Committee expressed interest in passing legislation to provide additional regulatory authority to address these risks. The U.S. Treasury Department has also requested additional authorities to combat using digital assets in illegal activities. While there is currently insufficient support for any particular proposal, we expect that regulatory efforts in this area will continue to evolve and potentially impact our business. 
 We also closely follow developments related to regulating digital asset markets and financial services. In January 2024, the SEC approved a series of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of digital assets. However, the regulatory landscape for digital asset markets remains complex and uncertain, with various agencies and lawmakers proposing different approaches to oversight and regulation. 
 As a company operating at the intersection of data center, cloud and HPC hosting services, we are committed to maintaining a proactive and adaptive approach to regulatory compliance. We closely monitor legislative and regulatory developments and engage in dialogue with relevant stakeholders to ensure our business practices align with the evolving legal and regulatory framework. Despite the uncertainties posed by the changing regulatory landscape, we remain committed to delivering innovative and responsible solutions in the data center, cloud and HPC hosting markets while prioritizing compliance and risk management. However, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to significant liabilities, including fines and penalties, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our critical accounting estimates are identified and described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

 In addition, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in the event the full intended additional megawatt energization for the Garden City hosting facility is not conditionally approved by the applicable regulatory authority within 120 days of the Closing, the total cash consideration was subject to a reduction of up to 34.0 million 25 million of which was held in escrow), depending on the amount of the additional megawatt energization that is not conditionally approved. On July 30, 2024, we announced that we have met the conditional approval requirements related to the release of the escrowed funds from the sale of our Garden City hosting facility.

 Commentary on Results of Operations Comparative Results for the Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 26.6 million, or 83 , from 32.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 58.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, primarily driven by increased capacity across our data center hosting facilities between periods, as well as the Company recognizing revenue under our Cloud Services business during the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to the launch of the service during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 Related party revenue decreased 2.3 million, or 54 , from 4.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 1.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, primarily driven by certain related parties terminating their contracts during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2025. 
 Cost of revenues 
 Cost of revenues increased 35.8 million, or 142 , from 25.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 61.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the growth in the business as more facilities were energized and as additional services were provided to customers compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The change in cost of revenues is categorized as follows: 
 approximately 28.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to an increase in owned and leased assets in-service directly supporting revenue; 
 approximately 5.1 million increase in lease and related expenses for the use of data center space to support the Company s cloud services business; 
 approximately 1.8 million increase in personnel expenses for employee costs directly attributable to generating revenue resulting from increased headcount supporting revenue; and 
 approximately 1.0 million increase in other expenses directly attributable to generating revenue. 
 These increases were partially offset by approximately 0.5 million decrease in energy costs due to more favorable pricing during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by 1.8 million, or 11 , from 16.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 14.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The decreases were primarily due to an 8.8 million decrease in stock based compensation expense and a 2.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, partially offset by: 
 approximately 4.8 million increase in professional service expenses primarily related to legal services provided on discrete transactions and projects as well as general support of the business; 
 approximately 3.3 million increase in lease and related expenses primarily for operating leases of data center space; and 
 approximately 0.8 million increase in personnel expense to support the growth of the business. 
 Gain on classification of held for sale 
 Gain on classification of held for sale was 24.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. This was primarily due to the receipt of 25.0 million released from escrow funds in association with the sale of our Garden City facility. This increase was partially offset by 0.2 million in loss on assets held for sale associated with writing down certain assets to their fair market value. There was no such activity recorded in the prior year comparative period.

 Loss on abandonment of assets 
 Loss on abandonment of assets was 0.6 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to the abandonment of assets associated with projects that are no longer viable. There was no such activity recorded in the prior year comparative period. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net increased 5.2 million, or 243 , from 2.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 7.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in finance leases and interest-bearing loans between periods. 
 Loss on change in fair value of debt 
 Loss on change in fair value of debt was 6.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to the adjustments to the fair value of the Yorkville Convertible Debt recorded during the three months ended August 31, 2024.

 Cloud services operating loss increased 8.4 million, from a loss of 7.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to a loss of 15.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 primarily driven by amortization expense on finance leases of computing equipment, occupancy costs from operating leases, and an increase stock-based compensation expense attributable to the segment due to headcount increasing year over year.

 Operating Loss 
 HPC hosting operating loss increased 2.2 million, or 290 from a loss of 0.8 million to a loss of 2.9 million. The loss was largely comprised of stock-based compensation expense, payroll, and amortization expense related to finance leases as the Company ramps up its HPC hosting operations. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented under GAAP, we are presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. We are providing these non-GAAP financial measures to disclose additional 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations by providing perspective on results absent one-time or significant non-cash items. We utilize these measures in the business planning process to understand expected operating performance and to evaluate results against those expectations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results regarding factors and trends affecting our business and provide a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations . 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental measures to the Company s performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore, are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, we caution investors that the non-GAAP financial measures as used by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, investors should be aware that when evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, these measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be items that we may exclude for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures and we may in the future cease to exclude items that we have historically excluded for purposes of our non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of the adjustments to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the non-GAAP reconciliations provided below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company s business. 
 Change in Presentation 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company updated its presentation of non-GAAP measures. As a result of this updated presentation, the Company no longer excludes start-up costs as an adjustment to Operating income (loss), Net loss, or EBITDA in our calculation of Adjusted operating (loss) income, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation, and Adjusted net loss attributable to Applied Digital Corporation per diluted share are non-GAAP measures and are defined below. 
 Adjusted Operating (Loss) Income, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share 
 Adjusted Operating Loss and Adjusted Net Loss are non-GAAP financial measures that represent operating loss and net loss, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation, non-recurring repair expenses, diligence, acquisition, disposition and integration expenses, litigation expenses, non-recurring research and development expenses, gain on classification of held for sale, accelerated depreciation and amortization, loss on legal settlement, as well as other non-recurring expenses that Management believes are not representative of the Company s expected ongoing costs. Adjusted Net Loss is Adjusted Operating Loss further adjusted for the losses associated with the abandonment of assets, changes in fair value of debt and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share as Adjusted Net Loss divided by weighted average diluted share count. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, non-recurring repair expenses, diligence, acquisition, disposition and integration expenses, litigation expenses, research and development expenses, gain on classification of held for sale, the losses associated with the abandonment of assets, changes in fair value of debt, debt extinguishment, as well as the loss on legal settlement and other non-recurring expenses that Management believes are not representative of the Company s expected ongoing costs.

 We expect to have sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand, payments from customers, access to debt financing, and access to public capital markets, to support ongoing operations and meet our working capital needs for at least the next 12 months and all of our known requirements and plans for cash. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our ongoing operations and development plans. We have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case, we would be required to obtain additional financing sooner than currently projected, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses and our operating expenditures will continue to increase as we continue to expand our operations. We believe that the significant investments in property and equipment will remain throughout fiscal year 2025 as we continue construction of our HPC hosting facilities and acquire assets to support our Cloud Services Business.

 Commentary on the change in cash flows between the Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 and Three Months Ended August 31, 2023 
 Operating Activities 
 The net cash (used in) provided by operating activities changed by 80.4 million, or 1780 , from net cash provided by operating activities of 4.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to net cash used in operating activities of 75.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The primary reasons for the change were a large increase in accounts payable, a decrease in revenue prepayments received relative to revenue earned during the three months ended August 31, 2024, as well as an increase in payments associated with our operating leases. 
 Investing Activities 
 The net cash used in investing activities decreased by 7.9 million, from 40.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 32.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt of 25.0 million of funds that were released from escrow in association with the sale of our Garden City facility as well as a decrease in lease prepayments made for leases of hosting equipment to support the our Cloud Services Business during the three months ended August 31, 2024. These changes were partially offset by an increase in investments in property and equipment during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as our payments in the current periods for construction of the Ellendale, North Dakota data center hosting facilities outpaced comparative period construction payments for the Garden City hosting facility and our HPC data centers. 
 Financing Activities 
 The net cash provided by financing activities increased by 139.7 million, or 590 , from 23.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023 to 163.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The primary reasons for the change were the receipt of net proceeds from the Company s common and preferred stock offerings and net debt proceeds as well as the receipt of cash for equity in the Company. These increases were partially offset by an increase in debt repayments and the payment of debt financing and stock issuance costs as well as an increase in finance lease payments during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of August 31, 2024, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2024, as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting disclosed below. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis. 
 We have identified the following material weaknesses in the design of our internal controls: 
 We have not yet designed and implemented controls to ensure we can record, process, summarize, and report financial data. 
 We have not yet designed and implemented user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 We did not design and maintain effective controls associated with related party transactions and disclosures. Controls were not designed or implemented at a sufficient level of precision or rigor to effectively identify related party relationships and disclose their related transactions in our financial statements. 
 We also do not have a properly designed internal control system that identifies critical processes and key controls. 
 The material weaknesses did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our management has concluded that, based on their knowledge, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we have begun to take the following steps, among others: 
 Hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel to support division of responsibilities, including utilizing an advisory, tax and assurance firm to assist with process documentation; 
 Improving and updating our systems; 
 Developing IT general controls to manage access and program changes across our key systems and the execution of improvements to application controls within our systems, including implementing user access reviews for all systems on a quarterly basis; and 
 Implementing processes and controls to better identify and manage segregation of duties, including executing an internal audit program to evaluate the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of key business processes and IT controls. 
 We will not be able to fully remediate the material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting, other than the remediation steps described above that are in process, that occurred during the three months ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings. 
 The Company, Wes Cummins, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and David Rench, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, have been named as defendants in a putative securities class action lawsuit in the matter styled, McConnell v. Applied Digital Corporation, et al., Case No. 3:23-cv-1805, filed in August 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Securities Lawsuit ). Specifically, the complaint asserts claims pursuant to Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, based on allegedly false or misleading statements regarding the company s business, operations, and compliance policies, including claims that the Company overstated the profitability of its Data Center Hosting Business and its ability to successfully transition into a low-cost cloud services provider and that the Company s board of directors was not independent within the meaning of NASDAQ listing rules. On May 22, 2024, the court appointed Lead plaintiff and approved lead counsel, and on July 22, 2024, Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint which asserts the same claims based on similar allegations in the original complaint. On September 20, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. See discussion in Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies . 
 The Company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in this action. If an unfavorable action were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to the Company s results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. 
 On November 15, 2023, a derivative action was filed in the matter styled, Weich v. Cummins, et al. , Case No. A-23-881629-C in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada. The Weich complaint names as defendants certain members of the Company s Board of Directors and its Chief Executive Officer Wesley Cummins and purports to name Chief Financial Officer David Rench as a defendant. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that the defendants caused or allowed the Company to make materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company s business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Company overstated the profitability of the Data Center Hosting Business and its ability to successfully transition into a low-cost cloud services provider and that the Board was not independent within the meaning of NASDAQ listing rules. On February 27, 2024, the derivative plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as the original complaint. On June 5, 2024, the Court entered an order granting the defendants motion to dismiss without prejudice and dismissing all claims against all defendants, including the Company. 
 On June 5, 2024, following briefing and argument on the defendants motion to dismiss, the Court entered an order granting the defendants motion without prejudice and dismissing all claims against all defendants, including the Company, on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to plead (1) demand futility as to each of plaintiff s claims or (2) a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The order dismissed all claims against all defendants, including the Company. The plaintiff can seek leave to file an amended complaint but to date has not done so. 
 The Company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in this action. If an unfavorable action were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to the Company s results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. 
 There are no other pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of the Company s consolidated operations.
