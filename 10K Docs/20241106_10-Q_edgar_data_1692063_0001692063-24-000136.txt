 We finance various types of transportation-related equipment for independent third parties under lease contracts, which are generally for one to and are accounted for as sales-type leases with fully guaranteed residual values. Our leases contain an option for the lessee to return, extend, or purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for the guaranteed contract residual amount. This contract residual amount is estimated to approximate the fair value of the equipment. Lease payments primarily include base rentals and guaranteed residual values. 
 Guaranteed residual lease values Total minimum lease payments to be received Unearned income ) ) Net investment in leases 
 Prior to entering a lease contract, we assess the credit quality of the potential lessee using credit checks and other relevant factors, ensuring that the inherent credit risk is consistent with our existing lease portfolio. Given our leases have fully guaranteed residual values and we can take possession of the transportation-related equipment in the event of default, we do not categorize net investment in leases by different credit quality indicators upon origination. We monitor our lease portfolio weekly by tracking amounts past due, days past due, and outstanding maintenance account balances, including performing subsequent credit checks as needed. Our net investment in leases with any portion past due as of September 30, 2024 was million, which includes both current and future lease payments. Lease payments on our lease receivables are generally due on a weekly basis and are classified as past due when the weekly payment is not received by its due date. As of September 30, 2024, our lease payments past due were million.

 In January 2023, our Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its Class A and/or Class B common shares. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares and is intended to help offset the dilutive effect of equity grants to employees over time. Under this program, the Company may repurchase shares in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased million of the million authorized under the repurchase program.

 million charge as a result of adverse audit assessments by a state tax authority over the applicability of sales tax for prior periods on rolling stock equipment used within that state. The Company filed a request for appeal of the audit assessment with the state jurisdiction, and during the second quarter of 2023, a ruling was made in favor of the state resulting in an additional million in interest and penalties being recorded by the Company to cover all periods audited. The Company filed a petition request with the state Appellate Tax Board in January 2024 covering periods at appeals. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company received an assessment for additional periods audited and filed a request for appeal of the assessment with the state jurisdiction. The adjustment recorded as a result of the audit, including additional interest and penalties, was not material. All assessments and related interest and penalties were recorded within operating supplies and expenses net on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

 reportable segments Truckload, Intermodal, and Logistics which are based primarily on the services each segment provides. 
 As of January 1, 2023, our operating segments within the Truckload reportable segment were VTL, Bulk, and MLS. As a result of expanding our dedicated business through recent acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we reorganized the operating segments within Truckload into Dedicated, which includes MLS and M Van Network; and Bulk. The three operating segments are aggregated because they have similar economic characteristics with our other Truckload operating segments and meet the other aggregation criteria described in ASC 280. Dedicated provides truckload services primarily focused on freight with consistent routes often based on long-term contracts, Van Network consists of irregular routes, and Bulk delivers key inputs for manufacturing processes, such as specialty chemicals. 
 The CODM reviews revenues for each segment without the inclusion of fuel surcharge revenues. For segment purposes, any fuel surcharge revenues earned are recorded as a reduction of the segment s fuel expenses. Income from operations at the segment level reflects the measure presented to the CODM for each segment.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

INTRODUCTION 
 Company Overview 
 We are a transportation and logistics services company providing a multimodal portfolio of truckload, intermodal, and logistics solutions. Our diversified portfolio of complementary service offerings enables us to serve our customers varied transportation needs and to allocate capital in a manner that seeks to maximize returns across all market cycles and economic conditions. We continually monitor our performance and market conditions to ensure appropriate allocation of capital and resources to grow our businesses, while optimizing returns across reportable segments. Our strong balance sheet, scalable platform, and experienced operations team are supportive of our acquisition strategy, which includes acquiring high-quality businesses that meet our disciplined selection criteria to enhance our service offerings and broaden our customer base. 
 Our truckload services consist of over the road freight transportation via dry van, bulk, temperature-controlled, and flat-bed trailers across either network or dedicated configurations. Freight is transported and delivered by our company-employed drivers in company trucks and by owner-operators with company-owned trailers and executed through long-haul or regional services, including customized solutions for high-value and time-sensitive loads throughout North America. 
 Our intermodal services consist of door-to-door container on flat car service through a combination of rail and dray transportation, in association with our rail providers. Our intermodal business uses company-owned containers, chassis, and trucks with primarily company dray drivers, augmented by third-party dray capacity. 
 Our logistics services consist of asset-light freight brokerage (including both traditional brokerage and Power Only services which leverage our nationwide company-owned trailer pools to match third-party capacity with customer demand), supply chain (including 3PL), warehousing, and import/export services. Our logistics business provides value-added services using both our assets and third-party capacity, augmented by our trailing assets, to manage and move our customers freight. 
 Our success depends on our ability to balance our transportation network and efficiently and effectively manage our resources in the delivery of truckload, intermodal, and logistics services to our customers. Resource requirements vary with customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. We believe that our ability to properly select freight and adapt to changes in customer transportation needs allows us to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in trucks, trailers, containers, and chassis or obtain qualified third-party capacity at reasonable prices. 
 Consistent with the transportation industry, our business can be seasonal across each of our segments, which generally translates to our reported revenues being the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher maintenance expense and higher fuel consumption from increased idle time. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In this section of our report, we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), (2) adjusted income from operations, (3) adjusted operating ratio, (4) adjusted net income, (5) adjusted EBITDA, and (6) free cash flow. We also provide reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Management believes the use of each of these non-GAAP measures assists investors in understanding our business by (1) removing the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance, (2) providing investors with the same information our management uses internally to assess our core operating performance, and (3) presenting comparable financial results between periods. In addition, in the case of revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), we believe the measure is useful to investors because it isolates volume, price, and cost changes directly related to industry demand and the way we operate our business from the external factor of fluctuating fuel prices and the programs we have in place to manage such fluctuations. Fuel-related costs and their impact on our industry are important to our results of operations, but they are often independent of other, more relevant factors affecting our results of operations and our industry. Free cash flow is used as a measure to assess overall liquidity and does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt.

 Although we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, they have limitations as analytical tools and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. You should not consider the non-GAAP measures in this report in isolation or as substitutes for, or alternatives to, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of unusual or infrequent items or other adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will not be affected by unusual or infrequent items or by other items similar to such adjustments. Our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results in addition to using the non-GAAP measures.

 Enterprise Results Summary 
 Enterprise net income decreased 5.0 million, approximately 14 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to decreases in income from operations of 3.6 million. Total other expenses increased 3.2 million, driven by investment gains recorded in 2023. These changes were partially offset by the corresponding 1.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. 
 Adjusted net income decreased 4.8 million, approximately 13 .

 Enterprise Revenues 
 Enterprise operating revenues decreased 36.3 million, approximately 3 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 Factors contributing to the decrease included: 
 a 34.5 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenues resulting from decreased fuel prices; 
 a 12.3 million decrease in Logistics segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) driven by decreased revenue per order and a small decline in volume within our brokerage business due to freight market conditions; 
 and a 3.1 million decrease in Truckload segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) primarily related to decreases in Network volume, offset by Dedicated growth; 
 Decreases were partially offset by: 
 a 26.8 million increase in Other segment revenue, primarily the result of increased volumes within our leasing business; 
 and a 1.7 million increase in Intermodal segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) attributable to an increase in orders. 
 Enterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) decreased 1.8 million. 
 Enterprise Income from Operations and Operating Ratio 
 Enterprise income from operations decreased 3.6 million, approximately 8 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023, largely related to decreases in net revenue per order in Logistics and volume within Network resulting from ongoing market pressures. Lower gains on equipment sales, an increase in depreciation related to higher revenue equipment counts and cost per unit, increases in insurance expense, and a slight volume reduction within Logistics also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by an increase in Dedicated volume driven by growth, a slight increase in Intermodal volume, and declines in purchased transportation costs. 
 Adjusted income from operations decreased 3.3 million, approximately 7 . 
 Enterprise operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues) increased on both a GAAP and adjusted basis when compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Enterprise Operating Expenses 
 Key operating expense fluctuations are described below. 
 Purchased transportation decreased 49.0 million, or 9 , quarter over quarter, resulting from declines in owner-operator purchased transportation costs within Truckload due to a reduction in owner-operator capacity and reduced third-party carrier costs within Logistics due to lower brokerage volume and purchased transportation costs per order. 
 Salaries, wages, and benefits increased 7.4 million, or 2 , quarter over quarter. Despite the impacts of the M M acquisition, salaries, wages, and benefits were comparable as incentives and healthcare were partially offset by lower wages. 
 Fuel and fuel taxes for company trucks decreased 21.4 million, or 18 , quarter over quarter, due to a lower cost per gallon, partially offset by an increase in company driver miles. A significant portion of fuel costs are recovered through our fuel surcharge programs. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 5.1 million, or 5 , quarter over quarter, mainly due to additional depreciation expense incurred as a result of trailer and tractor growth within Dedicated and the cumulative impacts from the increased cost of equipment. 
 Operating supplies and expenses net increased 30.9 million, or 22 , quarter over quarter, largely resulting from increases in cost of goods sold in our leasing business and lower gains on sales of equipment due to a decrease in average sales price per unit. 
 Insurance expense increased 9.8 million, or 37 , quarter over quarter, driven by an increase in auto liability insurance costs related to an increase in premiums and claims development. 
 Other general expenses decreased 15.5 million, or 33 , quarter over quarter, primarily related to a reduction in professional services and bad debt expense. 
 Total Other Expenses 
 Total other expenses increased 3.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 mainly due to a pre-tax net gain on our equity investments of 2.3 million in 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Our provision for income taxes decreased 1.8 million, or 17 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to lower taxable income. The effective income tax rate was 22.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.8 for the same quarter of 2023. Our provision for income taxes may fluctuate in future periods to the extent tax laws and regulations change.

 We monitor and analyze a number of KPIs to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. 
 Truckload 
 The following table presents our Truckload segment KPIs for the periods indicated, consistent with how revenues and expenses are reported internally for segment purposes. The two operations that make up our Truckload segment are as follows: 
 Dedicated - Transportation services with equipment devoted to customers under long-term contracts. 
 Network - Transportation services of one-way shipments.

 Truckload revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) decreased 3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. This was driven by a decrease in Network volume, partially offset by increases in Dedicated volumes due to organic growth and an increase in rate per loaded mile in Dedicated. 
 Truckload income from operations decreased 0.8 million, approximately 3 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. In addition to the revenue impacts listed above, other items contributing to the decrease include an increase in salaries and wages expense largely due to the M M acquisition, increased insurance premium expense, and lower gains on equipment sales. This was partially offset by decreased purchased transportation costs driven by a reduction in owner operator capacity.

 partially offset by a 5.6 million increase in Truckload segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) driven by Dedicated growth, including the M M acquisition, and increases in Dedicated revenue per truck per week. This was partially offset by declines in revenue within our Network business due to decreases in volume from ongoing soft market conditions and Network revenue per truck per week. 
 Enterprise revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) decreased 111.2 million, approximately 3 . 
 Enterprise Income from Operations and Operating Ratio 
 Enterprise income from operations decreased 142.3 million, approximately 54 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in net revenue per order in Logistics, rate per total mile within Network, revenue per order in Intermodal, and volume declines within our brokerage business driven by continued downward pressure on brokerage demand. Other factors contributing to the decrease included an increase in driver wages largely from the M M acquisition, increased cost of goods sold in our leasing business, reduced gains on equipment sales, increases in insurance expense, and increased depreciation due to higher revenue equipment counts and cost per unit. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Dedicated volumes attributable to organic and acquisitive growth, inclusive of the M M acquisition, and reduced purchased transportation costs. 
 Adjusted income from operations decreased 142.3 million, approximately 53 . 
 Enterprise operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues) increased on both a GAAP and adjusted basis when compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Enterprise Operating Expenses 
 Key operating expense fluctuations are described below. 
 Purchased transportation costs decreased 141.9 million, or 9 , period over period, primarily resulting from reduced third-party carrier costs within Logistics due to lower purchased transportation costs per order and brokerage volumes, as well as a decline in owner-operator purchased transportation costs within Truckload driven by a reduction in owner-operator capacity. 
 Salaries, wages, and benefits increased 51.5 million, or 5 , period over period. Apart from the effects of the M M acquisition, salaries, wages, and benefits were comparable to the prior year as incentives and health care were partially offset by lower wages. 
 Fuel and fuel taxes for company trucks decreased 22.8 million, or 7 , period over period, driven by a lower cost per gallon, partially offset by an increase in company driver miles within Truckload. A significant portion of fuel costs are recovered through our fuel surcharge programs. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 25.4 million, or 9 , period over period, mainly due to additional depreciation expense resulting from trailer and tractor growth within Dedicated, the ongoing impacts from the increased cost of equipment, and incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to the M M acquisition. 
 Operating supplies and expenses net increased 53.2 million, or 12 , period over period, driven by an increase in cost of goods sold in our leasing business and a reduction in gains on equipment sales due to a decrease in average sale price. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in equipment rental expense as a result of improved port fluidity and lower rail storage expense. 
 Insurance and related expenses increased 23.7 million, or 31 , period over period, driven by an increase in auto liability insurance costs related to an increase in premiums and claims development. 
 Other general expenses decreased 22.6 million, or 20 , period over period, largely related to a reduction in bad debt expense along with a decrease in professional services and driver recruiting costs.

 Total Other Expenses (Income) 
 Total other income decreased 25.3 million, approximately 187 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by pre-tax net losses on our equity investments of 0.2 million in 2024 compared to pre-tax net gains of 20.0 million in 2023. Interest income also decreased 3.6 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower cash balances. See Note 5, Investments , for more information on our equity investments. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Our provision for income taxes decreased 40.9 million, approximately 61 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to lower taxable income. The effective income tax rate was 24.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.2 for the same period in 2023. Our provision for income taxes may fluctuate in future periods to the extent tax laws and regulations change.

 We monitor and analyze a number of KPIs to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. 
 Truckload 
 The following table presents our Truckload segment KPIs for the periods indicated, consistent with how revenues and expenses are reported internally for segment purposes. The two operations that make up our Truckload segment are as follows: 
 Dedicated - Transportation services with equipment devoted to customers under long-term contracts. 
 Network - Transportation services of one-way shipments.

 (2) Includes company and owner-operator trucks. 
 (3) Calculated based on beginning and end of month counts and represents the average number of trucks available to haul freight over the specified timeframe. 
 (4) Calculated excluding fuel surcharge and revenue in transit, consistent with how revenue is reported internally for segment purposes, using weighted workdays. 
 (5) Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge), in millions, include revenue in transit at the operating segment level and, therefore does not sum with amounts presented above. 
 (6) Includes entire fleet of owned trailers, including trailers with leasing arrangements between Truckload and Logistics. 
 (7) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) including revenue in transit and related expenses at the operating segment level. 
 Truckload revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) increased 5.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Dedicated volume increased 8 due to organic new business growth and the acquisition of M M, offset by a reduction in Network volume and rate per loaded mile due to market conditions. 
 Truckload income from operations decreased 82.6 million, approximately 54 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Factors contributing to the decrease include the revenue impacts of Network listed above, increased wages largely as a result of the M M acquisition, a decrease in gains on equipment sales, increased insurance premium expense, and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of growth within Dedicated (including the M M acquisition). This was partially offset by a decrease in purchased transportation costs driven by reduced owner operator capacity.

 (3) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) including revenue in transit and related expenses at the operating segment level. 
 Intermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) decreased 25.1 million, approximately 3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This was driven by market conditions which led to a 121, or 5 , decrease in revenue per order. 
 Intermodal income from operations decreased 27.5 million, approximately 42 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 mainly resulting from the decreased revenue per order, partially offset by internal cost measures, network optimization, and improved dray productivity. 
 Logistics 
 The following table presents the KPI for our Logistics segment for the periods indicated. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Operating ratio (1) 
 97.5 96.2 
 (1) Calculated as segment operating expenses divided by segment revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) including revenue in transit and related expenses at the operating segment level. 
 Logistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) decreased 94.2 million, approximately 9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This was mainly the result of decreases in revenue per order and volume within our brokerage business, as well as reduced port dray revenues due to improved port fluidity in 2024. 
 Logistics income from operations decreased 15.6 million, approximately 39 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to reductions in net revenue per order and volume. 
 Other 
 Other income from operations decreased 16.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in earnings within our leasing business; partially offset by 2.9 million of additional interest and penalties related to the sales tax audit assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , for more information. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our primary uses of cash are working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt service requirements. Additionally, we may use cash for acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Working capital is required principally to ensure we are able to run the business and have sufficient funds to satisfy maturing short-term debt and operational expenses. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of transportation equipment and information technology. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations. In addition, we have a 250.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in November 2027 and a 200.0 million receivables purchase agreement maturing in May 2027, for which our combined available capacity as of September 30, 2024 was 305.7 million. Our revolving credit facility also allows us to request an additional increase in total commitment by up to 150.0 million. We anticipate that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that we will obtain these funds through additional borrowings, equity offerings, or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures, as well as our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness, will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors beyond our control. 
 The following table presents our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and outstanding debt and finance lease obligations as of the dates shown. 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 179.0 102.4 Marketable securities 52.6 57.2 Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities 231.6 159.6 Debt: Senior notes 185.0 185.0 Credit agreement 45.0 Receivables purchase agreement 70.0 60.0 Finance leases 8.7 12.1 Total debt 263.7 302.1 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and the agreements governing our senior notes. See Note 7, Debt and Credit Facilities , for information about our financing arrangements. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes the changes to our net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 486.6 486.1 Net cash used in investing activities (287.1) (776.8) Net cash used in financing activities (122.9) (36.5) 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 0.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by working capital was largely offset by a decrease in net income adjusted for various noncash items. Working capital changes were driven by increases in cash provided by receivables, other liabilities, claims reserves, and other assets, partially offset by an increase in cash used for payables. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 489.7 million, approximately 63 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used was primarily related to decreases in cash used for acquisitions, net capital expenditures, purchases of lease equipment, investments in equity securities, and purchases of marketable securities.

 Net Capital Expenditures 
 The following table sets forth our net capital expenditures for the periods indicated. Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Purchases of transportation equipment 328.1 500.6 Purchases of other property and equipment 27.8 33.9 Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (81.3) (106.2) Net capital expenditures 274.6 428.3 
 Net capital expenditures decreased 153.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was driven by a 172.5 million decrease in purchases of transportation equipment mainly due to higher spend on growth and replacement equipment in 2023. Proceeds from sale of property and equipment decreased year over year primarily due to lower proceeds per sale. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 86.4 million, approximately 237 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to 35.0 million of net payments under revolving credit agreements during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 91.0 million of net proceeds in the same period in 2023. Additionally, proceeds from long-term debt decreased 50.0 million year over year. These amounts were partially offset by decreases in payments on long-term debt of 69.3 million and treasury stock repurchases of 21.5 million. 
 Other Considerations that Could Affect Our Results, Liquidity, or Capital Resources 
 Factors that Could Result in a Goodwill Impairment 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually using the discounted cash flow, guideline public company, and guideline transaction methods, as applicable, to calculate the fair values of our reporting units. Key inputs used in the discounted cash flow approach include growth rates for sales and operating profit, perpetuity growth assumptions, and discount rates. Key inputs used in the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods include EBITDA valuation multiples of comparable companies and transactions. If interest rates rise or EBITDA valuation multiples of comparable companies and transactions decline, the calculated fair values of our reporting units will decrease, which could impact the results of our goodwill impairment tests. 
 We will perform our annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment as of October 31, 2024, with such analysis expected to be finalized during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual process of updating our goodwill impairment evaluation, we will assess the impact of current operating results and our resulting management actions to determine whether they have an impact on the long-term valuation of reporting units and the related recoverability of our goodwill. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 See the disclosure under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023. There were no material changes to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
