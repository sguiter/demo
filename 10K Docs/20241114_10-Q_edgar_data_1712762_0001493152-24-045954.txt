CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are
predictive in nature, depend on or refer to future events or conditions, and are sometimes identified by words such as may, 
 could, plan, project, predict, pursue, believe, expect, 
 estimate, anticipate, intend, target, seek, potentially, 
 will likely result, outlook, budget, objective, trend, or similar
expressions of a forward-looking nature and the negative versions of such expressions. The forward-looking information contained in this
report is generally located under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations but may be found in other locations as well. The forward-looking statements in this report generally relate to the
plans and objectives for future operations of bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. and are based on our management s reasonable estimates
of future results or trends. Although we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable, all forward-looking statements are
subject to various risks and uncertainties, and our projections and expectations may be incorrect. The factors that may affect our expectations
regarding our operations include, among others, the following: 

our
 projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, and capital requirements; 

the
 success, cost, and timing of our clinical trials; 

our
 ability to obtain funding for our operations necessary to complete further development and commercialization of our diagnostic tests
 or therapeutic product candidates; 

our
 dependence on third parties, including the conduct of our clinical trials; 

our
 ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market and commercialize our diagnostic tests or therapeutic product candidates; 

the
 potential that the results of our pre-clinical and clinical trials indicate our current diagnostic tests or any future diagnostic
 tests or therapeutic product candidates we may seek to develop are unsafe or ineffective; 

the
 results of market research conducted by us or others; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property IP protection for our current diagnostic test or future diagnostic
 tests and therapeutic product candidates; 

our
 ability to protect our IP rights and the potential for us to incur substantial costs from lawsuits to enforce or protect our IP rights; 

the
 possibility that a third party may claim we or our third-party licensors have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their
 IP rights and that we may incur substantial costs and be required to devote substantial time defending against such claims; 

the
 success of competing therapies, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic products that are or will become available; 

our
 ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and to retain and attract key personnel; 

our
 potential to incur substantial costs resulting from product liability lawsuits against us and the potential for such lawsuits to
 cause us to limit the commercialization of our diagnostic tests and therapeutic product candidates; 

market
 acceptance of our diagnostic test and diagnostic tests in development and therapeutic product candidates, the size and growth of
 the potential markets for our current diagnostic test, diagnostic tests in development, and therapeutic product candidates, and any
 future diagnostic tests and therapeutic product candidates we may seek to develop, and our ability to serve those markets; 

the
 successful development of our commercialization capabilities, including sales and marketing capabilities; 

compliance
 with government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety regulations, and liabilities thereunder; 

the
 impact of a health epidemic on our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare systems, or the global economy
 as a whole; 

general
 instability of economic and political conditions in the United States, including inflationary pressures, increased interest rates,
 economic slowdown or recession, and escalating geopolitical tensions; 

2 

compliance
 with government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety regulations, and
 liabilities thereunder; 

anticipated
 uses of net proceeds from our financings; 

the
 increased expenses associated with being a public company; and 

other
 factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Many
of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, as well as risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us, are, and may be, exacerbated
by factors such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the war in the Middle East, escalating tensions between China and
Taiwan, increasing economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, and any consequent worsening of the global business and economic
environment. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors. Should one or more of the
risks or uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report or any other filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC occur or should the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements we make herein and therein prove incorrect, our actual results
and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference within it with the understanding that our actual future results,
performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

million at September
30, 2024. The Company s cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, were approximately 
million. Based on the Company s current expected level of operating expenditures and the cash and cash equivalents on hand at
September 30, 2024, management concludes that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve (12) months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements. Therefore, on October 21, 2024, the Company consummated a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement offering, pursuant to which the Company raised an additional 
million in cash, see Note 15. Subsequent Events . However, the Company may need to raise further capital through the sale of
additional equity or debt securities or other debt instruments, strategic relationships or grants, or other arrangements to support
its future operations, if revenue from operations does not significantly increase. If such funding is not available or not available
on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company s current development plan may be curtailed. Furthermore, an alternative
source of funding to the sale of additional equity or debt securities is the exercise of outstanding warrants for which there can
be no guarantee. No adjustments have been made to the presented condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of this
uncertainty. 

In
determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, it applies a qualitative approach that determines
whether it has both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses
of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. The Company continuously
assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as changes to existing relationships or future transactions
may result in the Company consolidating or deconsolidating one or more of its collaborators or partners. 

, which consists of: (1) million in cash paid at closing and (2) shares of the Company s
Common Stock valued at million. The assets purchased included a clinical pathology laboratory regulated by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services CMS and accredited by the College of American Pathologists CAP and certified under
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 CLIA ). The primary reason for the acquisition was control of the
laboratory in which CyPath Lung is ordered and processed. 

The
Company recognized goodwill of arising from the acquisition. The acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination
in accordance with ASC 805. The Company has determined the preliminary fair values of the accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
accrued expenses that make up the majority of the net working capital assumed in the acquisition.

14, 2023, reported net working capital of and goodwill of . The amounts have been updated to reflect the purchase
price adjustments to accounts payable and accounts receivable that existed at the time of the acquisition. The Company incurred and expensed
approximately in acquisition costs. 

For

of , net loss of and loss per share of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

of the Company s consolidated net revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. The laboratory, which provides
clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion
of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered. The Company estimates the amount of consideration
it expects to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These
estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions. The portfolios determined
using the portfolio approach consist of the following groups of payer customers: healthcare insurers, government payers (Medicare and
Medicaid programs), client payers, and self-pay. Contracts do not contain significant financing components based on the typical period
of time between performance of services and collection of consideration. 

The
process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant judgment and estimation. The
Company follows a standard process, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors (including the period
of time that the receivables have been outstanding), to estimate contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, recording adjustments
in the current period as changes in estimates. Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon
settlement.

to 
years as of September 30, 2024. The Company has finance leases consisting of office and lab equipment with remaining lease terms
ranging from approximately 
to 
years as of September 30, 2024, for which the Company has determined that it will use the equipment for a major part of its
remaining economic life. 

The
lease agreements generally do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. Therefore, the Company used a benchmark approach as of the date
of inception of the leases to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate to discount remaining lease payments. The Company benchmarked
itself against other companies of similar credit ratings and comparable quality and derived imputed interest rates ranging from 
to for the lease term lengths. 

Leases
with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. There are no material residual guarantees associated
with any of the Company s leases, and there are no significant restrictions or covenants included in the Company s lease
agreements. Certain leases include variable payments related to common area maintenance and property taxes, which are billed by the landlord,
as is customary with these types of charges for office space. The Company has not entered into any lease arrangements with related parties,
and the Company is not the sublessor in any arrangement. 

The
Company s existing leases contain escalation clauses and renewal options. The Company has evaluated several factors in assessing
whether there is reasonable certainty that the Company will exercise a contractual renewal option. For leases with renewal options that
are reasonably certain to be exercised, the Company included the renewal term in the total lease term used in calculating the right-of-use
asset and lease liability.

Company
Overview 

Business 

bioAffinity
Technologies, Inc. (the Company, bioAffinity Technologies, we, or our develops
noninvasive diagnostics to detect early-stage lung cancer and other diseases of the lung. We also are conducting early-stage research
focused on advancing therapeutic discoveries that could result in broad-spectrum cancer treatments. We have developed a proprietary noninvasive
diagnostic test using technology that identifies cancer cells and cell populations indicative of a diseased state for analysis using
proprietary platforms developed using AI. Research and optimization of our platform technologies are conducted in laboratories at our
wholly owned subsidiary, Precision Pathology Laboratory Services, LLC PPLS ), and The University of Texas at San Antonio. 

Our
diagnostic test, CyPath Lung, addresses the need for noninvasive detection of early-stage lung cancer. Lung cancer is
the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Physicians are able to order CyPath Lung to assist in their assessment of
patients who are at high risk for lung cancer. The CyPath Lung test enables physicians to more confidently distinguish
between patients who will likely benefit from timely intervention and more invasive follow-up procedures from patients who are likely
without lung cancer and should continue annual screening. CyPath Lung has the potential to increase overall diagnostic
accuracy of lung cancer, which could lead to increased survival, fewer unnecessary invasive procedures, reduced patient anxiety, and
lower medical costs.

Through
our wholly owned subsidiary PPLS, we acquired the assets of Village Oaks Pathology Services, P.A., a Texas professional association d/b/a
Precision Pathology Services, including the clinical pathology laboratory it owned, and we now operate the laboratory. 

Recent
Developments 

On
August 5, 2024, the Company entered into warrant exercise agreements with three existing accredited investors to exercise certain outstanding
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,041,667 of the Company s shares of Common Stock (the Existing Warrants ). The
exercising holders received in a private placement new unregistered warrants (the New Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of 1,302,082 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of 1.50 per share and are initially exercisable on the date that stockholder
approval of the exercise of the New Warrants is obtained and will expire five years from the date of such approval. In connection with
the exercise of the Existing Warrants, the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of the Existing Warrants from 1.64 to 1.25 per
share. The exercise of the Existing Warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants occurred on August 5, 2024. On the same day, the Company
also entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor (the Purchaser ),
pursuant to which the Company issued to the Purchaser, (1) in a registered direct offering, 360,000 shares of Common Stock, and (2) in
a concurrent private placement, warrants (the Private Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 450,000 shares of Common Stock
(the Private Warrant Shares ), with an exercise price of 1.50 (collectively, the Offering ). In addition,
the placement agent was granted warrants to purchase 49,862 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of 1.50. 

On
August 23, 2024, bioAffinity Technologies announced J. Michael Edwards, who oversaw the Company s Initial Public Offering IPO as the Company s Chief Financial Officer CFO ), would replace Michael Dougherty who resigned
his position to move to the Pacific Northwest where he accepted a CFO position in the energy industry. Mr. Edwards
has more than three decades of experience in financial management and business strategy. Previously, he was CFO of CytoBioscience
Inc., which develops and manufactures instruments for disease analysis and treatment, and OncoVista Innovative Therapies, Inc., a
biopharmaceutical company that develops targeted anticancer therapies by utilizing tumor-associated biomarkers. Earlier in his
career, Mr. Edwards held finance positions at BioNumerik Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Ilex Oncology, Inc. He is a certified public
accountant who began his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Edwards earned his MBA from The University of Texas McCombs School of
Business in Austin. 

On
September 18, 2024, the Company announced publication in a peer-reviewed journal of an economic study concluding that adding CyPath 
 Lung to the standard of care for Medicare patients with a positive lung cancer screening could have saved an average of 2,773
per patient for total cost savings of 379 million in 2022. The study found that adding CyPath Lung to the standard of
care for private-payer patients could save an average of 6,460 per patient and estimated total healthcare savings of 895 million if
all individuals screened in 2022 were covered by private insurance. The peer-reviewed study, published in the Journal of Health Economics
and Outcomes Research, attributes the savings to a reduction in follow-up diagnostic assessments, expensive follow-up procedures and
procedure-related complications. Michael J. Morris, M.D., Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) pulmonology and critical care physician and
Assistant Dean of Research at San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, and Sheila A. Habib, M.D., Director of the
Pulmonary Lung Nodule Clinic and the Lung Cancer Screening Program at the South Texas Veterans Health Care Systems Audie L. Murphy
Memorial Veterans Hospital and Assistant Professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, were first and second
authors on the study. Economists John E. Schneider, Ph.D., and Maggie L. Do Valle, Master of Public Health, of Avalon Health Economics
also contributed to the study. 

On October 21, 2024, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with institutional investors (the Purchasers ),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Purchasers, (i) in a registered direct offering, 2,048,294 shares (the Shares of Common Stock, and (ii) in a concurrent private placement, common warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,662,782 shares of Common Stock,
with an exercise price of 1.50. 

On October 30, 2024, the Company announced that the Japan Patent Office
had issued a Certificate of Grant of Patent to bioAffinity Technologies for the method of predicting the likelihood of lung cancer used
by the CyPath Lung diagnostic test for early-stage lung cancer. The Japanese patent,
titled System and Method for Determining the State of Health of the Lungs, is an important addition to bioAffinity Technologies 
patent portfolio, which includes 17 awarded U.S. and foreign patents and 30 pending patent applications related to its diagnostic platform
and cancer treatment therapeutics. The Japanese patent is the first awarded for the CyPath Lung flow cytometry
test as a stand-alone assay for the detection of lung cancer. 

On November 1, 2024, William Bauta,
Ph.D., was named Chief Science Officer for bioAffinity Technologies. Dr. Bauta joined bioAffinity Technologies in 2016 as Senior
Vice President of Research and Development and has been responsible for multiple Company inventions for which patents have been
awarded or patent applications pending that support bioAffinity Technologies diagnostic and therapeutic advancements,
including CyPath Lung. Before coming to bioAffinity Technologies, Dr. Bauta was Associate Director of science at Genzyme
Corporation and held a similar position at Ilex Products, Inc., where he was responsible for the discovery, development and FDA
approval of multiple therapeutics. In addition to bioAffinity Technologies patents on which he is a named inventor, he holds several
additional healthcare-related patents and has published in more than a dozen scientific journals, including the journal Science. Dr.
Bauta received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago where he received fellowships from the National Science Foundation and the
American Chemical Society. His post-doctoral studies were at the University of Texas at Austin under a National Institutes of Health
fellowship. Dr. Bauta succeeds Vivienne I. Rebel, M.D., Ph.D. who retired from her position on October 31, 2024 as Executive Vice
President and Chief Science and Medical Officer for bioAffinity Technologies. Dr. Rebel is a stem cell biologist whose academic
research focused on understanding the molecular events that regulate blood-forming stem cells in bone marrow and prohibit them from
developing into cancer. She joined the Company in 2016 and led the research and development of the Company s first commercial
product, CyPath Lung, for the early detection of lung cancer. 

Financial 

To
date, we have devoted a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources to the development of our diagnostic test,
CyPath Lung. As a result, since our inception in 2014, we have funded our operations principally through private
sales of our equity and our initial public offering. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 million. As
of November 12, 2024, after the October 2024 Offerings, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.0 million, which we expect will not
support our operations beyond March 2025. 

Prior
to acquisition of the clinical pathology laboratory by PPLS, Village Oaks, under the trade name Precision Pathology Services, had
licensed and developed CyPath Lung as a laboratory developed test LDT for sale to physicians. The
license agreement provided that revenues from the sale would be split evenly between us and Village Oaks. In the second quarter of
2022, prior to the acquisition, we started to recognize revenue as part of a limited beta market testing program of the
CyPath Lung test. We have never been profitable, and as of September 30, 2024, we had total working capital of
approximately 58,000 and an accumulated deficit of approximately 50.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant
operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our diagnostic tests and advance our diagnostic tests
through clinical trials; however, we expect revenue to increase due to the acquisition of the clinical pathology laboratory (the
 Acquisition ). We intend to license our therapeutic products for clinical development should animal and pre-clinical
studies prove successful. 

We
anticipate raising additional cash needed through the private or public sales of equity or debt securities, collaborative arrangements,
or a combination thereof to continue to fund our operations and develop our products. There is no assurance that any such collaborative
arrangement will be entered into or that financing will be available to us when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations
or, if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may be forced to curtail operations,
delay our clinical trials, cease operations altogether, or file for bankruptcy.

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 2.0 million, compared to a net loss of approximately 2.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue 

Since acquisition of the clinical
pathology laboratory on September 19, 2023, additional revenue streams have been consolidated. PPLS generates three sources of
revenue: (1) patient service fees, (2) histology service fees, and (3) medical director fees. Pre-acquisition, bioAffinity
Technologies revenue was generated in three ways: (1) royalties from our diagnostic test, CyPath Lung, (2)
clinical flow cytometry services provided to Village Oaks related to our CyPath Lung test, and (3) CyPath Lung
tests purchased by the U.S. Department of Defense DOD for an observational study, Detection of Abnormal
Respiratory Cell Populations in Lung Cancer Screening Patients Using the CyPath Lung Assay (NCT05870592), and
research and development on using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a biological sample to assess cardiopulmonary function and
exercise performance in military personnel post-COVID-19 infection. The royalty income from CyPath Lung and clinical
flow cytometry services income, beginning September 19, 2023, are related party income and, therefore, eliminated from consolidated
net revenues. See net revenue summarized in the table below.

Operating
expenses totaled approximately 4.3 million and 2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase in operating expenses is the result of the following factors: 

Direct
costs and expenses 

Our
direct costs and expenses are primarily direct labor for pathology services, laboratory supplies and reagents, laboratory equipment,
and allocated shared facilities. Direct costs and expenses totaled 1.4 million and 74,704 during the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately 1.4 million for 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to the laboratory
operations of the newly acquired clinical pathology laboratory in September 2023. 

21 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures for lab operations, preclinical studies, compensation,
and consulting costs. 

Research
and development expenses totaled 274,497 and 330,376 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease
of approximately 56,000, or 17 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due
to the acquisition of PPLS in September 2023 due to acquiring new personnel and related costs for the laboratory supplies and reagents in 2023. Additionally, equipment costs increased in 2023 as we purchased capital
equipment to support research and development efforts. 

Clinical
Development 

Clinical
development expenses totaled 93,705 and 106,422 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease
of approximately 12,000, or 12 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily
attributable to an increase in professional fees in 2023, including consulting fees, related to evaluating the clinical strategy for
our pivotal clinical trial designed to confirm the sensitivity and specificity of CyPath Lung in detecting lung
cancer in persons at high risk for the disease, including patients who display indeterminate pulmonary nodules between 6mm and 30mm
in size which often present a challenge in diagnosis. 

Selling,
General and Administrative 

Our
selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures related to employee compensation, selling and marketing
costs, legal, accounting and tax, and other professional services, and general operating expenses. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses totaled approximately 2.4 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately 0.4 million, or 17 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to acquired general and administrative costs from PPLS and an increase in employee
compensation related to administrative and sales due to additional personnel and support services to support the launch of sales of our
diagnostic test, CyPath Lung. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses totaled 151,298 and 57,569 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
of approximately 93,729, or 163 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable
to depreciation on the assets from the acquisition of PPLS in September 2023. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense), net totaled 24,417) and 5,914 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
decrease in the other income of 30,331 is mostly attributable to a reduction in interest income of 24,965 which is due to a lower
cash balance in a money market savings account and an increase in interest expense of 12,846 related to equipment finance leases
from the acquired PPLS laboratory as compared to the same period last year. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 6.1 million, compared to a net loss of approximately 5.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue 

Post-acquisition,
additional revenue streams have been consolidated starting September 19, 2023. PPLS generates three sources of revenue: (1) patient service
fees, (2) histology service fees, and (3) medical director fees. Pre-acquisition, bioAffinity Technologies revenue was generated
in three ways: (1) royalties from our diagnostic test, CyPath Lung, (2) clinical flow cytometry services
provided to Village Oaks related to our CyPath Lung test, and (3) CyPath Lung tests purchased
by the DOD for an observational study, Detection of Abnormal Respiratory Cell Populations in Lung Cancer Screening Patients Using
the CyPath Lung Assay (NCT05870592), and research and development on using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a biological
sample to assess cardiopulmonary function and exercise performance in military personnel post-COVID-19 infection. The royalty income
from CyPath Lung and clinical flow cytometry services income, beginning September 19, 2023, are related party income
and, therefore, eliminated from consolidated net revenues. See net revenue summarized in the table below.

Operating
expenses totaled approximately 13.5 million and 6.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase in operating expenses is the result of the following factors: 

Direct
costs and expenses 

Our
direct costs and expenses are primarily direct labor for pathology services, laboratory supplies and reagents, laboratory equipment,
and allocated shared facilities. Direct costs and expenses totaled 4,421,309 and 76,025 during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately 4.3 million for 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable an entire quarter of laboratory
operations for PPLS compared to a partial quarter in 2023 from the acquisition of PPLS in September 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures for laboratory operations, preclinical and clinical studies, compensation,
and consulting costs. 

Research
and development expenses totaled 1.1 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
increase of approximately 35,000, or 3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily
due to an increase in compensation costs and benefits as we added research personnel, as well as a related increase in costs for laboratory
supplies and reagents. 

Clinical
Development 

Clinical
development expenses totaled 194,127 and 161,310 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
of approximately 32,000, or 20 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable
to an increase in compensation costs and benefits as we added clinical development personnel. 

Selling,
General and Administrative 

Our
selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures related to employee compensation, selling and marketing
costs, legal, accounting and tax, and other professional services, and general operating expenses. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses totaled approximately 7.0 million and 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately 2.4 million, or 53 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to acquired general and administrative costs from PPLS and an increase in employee
compensation related to administrative and sales due to additional personnel and support services to support the launch of sales of our
diagnostic test, CyPath Lung. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses totaled 452,005 and 100,805 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
of approximately 351,000, or 348 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable
to depreciation on the assets from the acquisition of PPLS in September 2023. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense), net totaled 54,392) and 85,676 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
decrease in other income of approximately 140,000 is mostly attributable to a reduction in interest income of 96,430 which is due
to a lower cash balance in a money market savings account and an increase in interest expense of 55,629 related to equipment
finance leases from the acquired PPLS laboratory as compared to the same period last year. 

23 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources, and Going Concern 

To
date, we have funded our operations primarily through our IPO, subsequent registered direct offering, exercise of warrants, and the sale
of our securities, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 38.5 million. We have evaluated whether there are conditions and events
that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date the condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued. 

We
have incurred losses since our inception in 2014 as a result of significant expenditures for operations and research and development
and, prior to April 2022, the lack of any approved diagnostic test or therapeutic products to generate revenue. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 6.1 million and 5.6 million, respectively, and we expect to incur substantial
additional losses in future periods. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately 50.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Despite
our recent financing in October 2024, pursuant to which we raised gross proceeds of approximately 2.3 million, we believe our current
cash and anticipated revenue from operations will not be sufficient to support our operations beyond March 2025. Based on our
current expected level of operating expenditures, current expected levels of revenue, and the cash and cash equivalents on hand at September
30, 2024, of 0.8 million, management concludes that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve (12) months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements contained in this Quarterly Report. We need to raise further capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities
or other debt instruments, strategic relationships or grants, or through exercised outstanding warrants to support our future operations
unless our revenue increases significantly. Our business plan includes expansion for our commercialization efforts which will require
additional funding. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue and raise capital from financing transactions. There
can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing these objectives. 

We
continue to seek sources of financing to fund our continued operations and research and development programs. To raise additional capital,
we may sell additional equity or debt securities, or enter into collaborative, strategic, and/or licensing transactions. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing transaction in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or otherwise enter
into a collaborative or strategic transaction. If we are not able to raise additional cash, we may be forced to delay, curtail, or cease
development of our diagnostic tests or therapeutic products, or cease operations altogether.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 5.6 million and 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The increase of approximately 1.1 million in cash used by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 852,000 in our loss from operations and
an increase in patient accounts receivables of approximately 587,000 due to a change in external professional medical billing providers effective
March 1, 2024. The transition period from the previous to the new medical billing provider has caused a temporary delay in billing and
deposits, as anticipated. 

24 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

We
used approximately 80,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in investing activities related primarily to the purchase
of computer and laboratory equipment, compared to approximately 2.2 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. We used approximately 2.2 million of cash in the prior year related primarily to the Acquisition of the
clinical pathology laboratory, which occurred on September 18, 2023. 

Net
Cash Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities 

Cash
provided in financing activities was approximately 3.6 million compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately 260,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in proceeds from prior year was primarily related to
net proceeds from the equity transactions in the current year for 3.6 million. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

We
enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract organizations for clinical trials and other services
and products used for research and development and operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination following a
certain period after notice, and therefore we believe that any non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases these significant judgments
and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable based upon information presently available.
Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 

Patient
Fee Revenues 

We
follow ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires revenue recognition in the period in which the service was
performed. To be able to report timely net revenues for the period, estimates are used for a portion of uncollected balances. These estimates
relate to third-party historical contractual discounts and adjustments (e.g., insurance providers) and patient historical uncollectible
amounts. There can be a significant delay from the time a patient has been serviced to the invoicing of that service and collection of
net proceeds. Historical data is used to determine estimates for those in service revenues that have not been billed or
collected at the reporting period. 

Patient
Fee Receivables and Considerations for Credit Losses 

We
follow accounting considerations of CECL - Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments. With PPLS acquisition of the clinical pathology laboratory and control of Village Oaks, our board-certified pathologists
provide anatomic and clinical pathology services for patients and other customers. Our other customer types include contract
research organizations CROs ), hospitals, and independent laboratories. We enter into contracts with our customers
for these services. The majority of our revenues stem from fees for services provided to patients, and thus in those
arrangements the patient is the customer, although the services may be requested by a physician on the patient s behalf. Furthermore,
in addition to its contracts with patients, we separately contract with third-party payers (insurance companies and governmental
payers), who are typically responsible for all or the majority of the fees agreed upon for such services provided to patients. Historically,
material amounts of gross charges are not collected due to various agreements with insurance companies, capped pricing levels for government
payers, and uncollectible balances from individual payers. To estimate these allowances of credit losses, we assess the portfolio
risk segments and historical data on collection rates. These estimated allowances offset patient revenues and accounts receivables. 

Discount
Rate for Finance Leased Equipment 

We
follow ASC 842, Leases , under which a lessee is required to recognize most leases on its balance sheet. We have elected
to apply a third-party valuation increment borrowing rate IBR as the discount rate by class of underlying assets when
the rate is not implicit in the lease. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
follow ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense
for all share-based payment awards made to employees, directors, and non-employees based on estimated fair values. We have used the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to estimate grant date fair value for all option grants. The assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of
share-based payment awards represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application
of management judgment. Since we use different assumptions based on a change in factors, our stock-based compensation expense could be
materially different in the future. 

Accounting
for Income Taxes 

We
are governed by U.S. income tax laws, which are administered by the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). We follow ASC 740,
 Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which the related temporary difference
becomes deductible. 

25 

Going
Concern 

Our
evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern requires us to evaluate our future sources and uses of cash sufficient to fund
our currently expected operations and research and development activities one year from the date our consolidated financial statements
are issued. We evaluate the probability associated with each source and use of cash resources in making our going concern determination.
The research and development of our diagnostic tests and therapeutic products are inherently subject to uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as a part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, we did not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements during any of the periods presented. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are both an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are therefore subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As
a smaller reporting company, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act, we are not required to provide
the information required by this Item 3. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is collected, recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified under the rules of the SEC. The term disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September
30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2024. Based on their assessment, they have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) over financial reporting
during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the period covered by this Quarterly Report, that could materially affect, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

26 

PART
II 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From
time to time, we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. To date, we have
had no material pending legal proceedings, and we are not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

In
addition to other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the Risk Factors discussed
in the 2023 Form 10-K, for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described
in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial might materially adversely affect our actual business, financial condition, and
operating results. The following information updates and should be read in conjunction with the information disclosed in Part I, Item
1A, Risk Factors, contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from
the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Risks
Related to Our Financial Position 

Our
business plan relies upon our ability to obtain additional sources of capital and financing. If the amount of capital we are able to
raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be
required to cease operations. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we generated revenue of approximately 7.2 million and 319,143, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 6.3 million from laboratory patient services (of
which approximately 332,000 related to our first diagnostic test, CyPath Lung), approximately 812,000 from histology
laboratory tests, approximately 50,000 from medical director fees, and approximately 9,000 in connection with CyPath 
Lung tests purchased by the DOD for an observational study. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated 2.2 million from laboratory
patient services (of which approximately 37,000 related to our first diagnostic test, CyPath Lung), approximately 273,000
from histology laboratory tests, approximately 19,000 from medical director fees, and approximately 19,000 in connection with CyPath 
 Lung tests purchased by the DOD for an observational study. 

To
become and remain profitable, we must succeed in generating additional laboratory revenue and developing and commercializing our diagnostic
tests and therapeutic products that we expect will generate significant income in the planned timeframe. This will require us to be successful
in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our diagnostic and therapeutic
technologies, obtaining regulatory approval for our diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, manufacturing, marketing, and selling any
diagnostic tests and therapeutic products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, and establishing and managing our collaborations
at various phases of each diagnostic test and therapeutic product candidate s development. We are in the preliminary phases of
these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate sufficient income to achieve profitability. 

To
become profitable, we must develop our diagnostic tests and therapeutic products, which will depend in large part on our ability to: 

Develop,
 enhance, and protect our diagnostic tests and therapeutic products; 

Raise
 sufficient funding to support our diagnostic tests and therapeutic product development program(s); 

Complete
 pre-clinical testing; 

27 

Work
 with our partners to expand commercialization of our first diagnostic test, CyPath Lung, as an LDT under the CAP/CLIA
 guidelines and regulations administered by CMS and CAP; 

Obtain
 de novo classification from FDA for our CyPath Lung as a Class II in vitro diagnostic; 

Work
 with our partners to develop and commercialize our first diagnostic test, CyPath Lung, as a CE-marked test in accordance
 with the In Vitro Diagnostic Device Regulation (the IVDR of the European Union EU); 

Synthesize,
 test, and attract licensing partners for drug conjugates, siRNAs, and other therapeutics (and methods for their use) developed by
 the Company; 

Develop
 and conduct human clinical studies to support the regulatory approval and marketing of our diagnostic test(s) and therapeutic product(s); 

Develop
 and manufacture the test(s) and product(s) to FDA standards, appropriate EU standards, and appropriate standards required for the
 commercialization of our tests and products in countries in which we seek to sell our diagnostic test(s) and therapeutic product(s); 

Obtain
 the necessary regulatory approvals to market our diagnostic test(s) and therapeutic product(s); 

Secure
 the necessary personnel and infrastructure to support the development, commercialization, and marketing of our diagnostic test(s)
 and therapeutic product(s); and 

Develop
 strategic relationships to support development, manufacturing, and marketing of our diagnostic test(s) and therapeutic product(s). 

Even
if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to
become and remain profitable would depress the value of our Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business,
maintain the research and development efforts, diversify our diagnostic tests and therapeutic product offerings, or even continue our
operations. A decline in the value of our Company could also cause our investors to lose all or part of their investment. 

We
must raise additional capital to fund our operations in order to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 50.7 million. As of November 12, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 2.0
million. Despite our recent financings, we will need to raise further capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities
or other debt instruments, strategic relationships or grants, or other arrangements to support our future operations. Our business plan
includes expansion for our commercialization efforts which will require additional funding. If we are unable to improve our liquidity
position, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability
to generate revenue and raise capital from financing transactions. Without funding from the proceeds of a capital raise or strategic
relationship or grant, management anticipates that our cash resources are sufficient to continue operations through March 2025. Our future
is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of new business opportunities.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing these objectives. Without such additional capital, we may be required
to curtail or cease operations and be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of
business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment. WithumSmith+Brown, PC, our
independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, has included an explanatory paragraph in its
opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, indicating that
our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
are unable to precisely estimate when we will begin to generate significant profit from revenue, if ever, from PPLS services,
the amount of profit or revenue that will be generated, or the expenses that will be incurred. 

We
do not expect to immediately derive profit from revenue from PPLS services. Since its acquisition in September 2023, we have generated
 9.6 million in revenue from PPLS. Once we begin to generate such profit, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to realize
the expected financial benefits of the acquisition. In addition, since we have limited experience operating a clinical laboratory, we
may not accurately estimate the expenses we will incur. 

28 

Our
failure to file a registration statement to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued
in October 2024, or to timely hold a stockholders meeting to obtain stockholder approval of the issuance of shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of the warrants issued in October 2024, will result in a breach of the terms of certain agreements. 

Pursuant
to the terms of certain agreements that we entered into with certain purchasers
in October 2024, we are obligated to file a registration statement to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
warrants issued to such purchasers within 45 days of the date of such agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
registration statement effective at all times while the purchasers own any warrants or shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the warrants. We are also obligated to hold a stockholders meeting 90 days after the closing date and, if approval is not obtained
at the shareholders meeting, every six months thereafter seeking approval of the exercise of the warrants issued to the purchasers . 
Additionally, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statements that we filed to register the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants that we issued in March 2024 and August 2024 effective at all times for so long
as the purchasers of such warrants own any such warrants or shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof. The failure to take
any of these actions will constitute a default under the operative agreement. 

Our
management collectively owns a substantial percentage of our Common Stock. 

Based
on the provisions for determining beneficial ownership in accordance with Rule 13d-3 and Item 403 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act, our officers and directors own or exercise control of approximately 46.13 of the voting power
of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, investors may be prevented from affecting matters involving our Company, including: 

the
 composition of our Board and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment
 and removal of officers; 

any
 determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations; 

our
 acquisition or disposition of assets; and 

our
 corporate financing activities. 

Furthermore,
this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business
combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely
affect the trading price for our Common Stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company that is controlled
by a small number of stockholders.
