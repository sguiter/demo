 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 August
31, 2024 

million, working capital of million, and million available to draw under
its TBK Facility. On September 12, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with TBK Bank (the TBK Facility to temporarily
increase the credit limit under the TBK Facility from million to million for a period of six months. The Company has incurred
net losses of million and used cash for its operations in the amount of million during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 primarily
due to the ramp up of accounts receivable and accounts payable during the most recent quarter ended due to an increase in sales. The
net losses and cash used in operations are indicators of substantial doubt. 

The Company is currently evaluating several different strategies to enhance its liquidity
position. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, pursuing additional actions under its strategic plan, seeking additional
financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity securities and seeking to extend the term of outstanding
debt. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. There can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to raise the capital it needs to continue its operations on satisfactory terms or at all. If capital is not available to the
Company when, and in the amounts needed, the Company could be required to liquidate its assets, cease or curtail operations, which could
materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations, or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar
state proceedings. 

The Company is continually evaluating its liquidity requirements in light of its operating
needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. Based on its assessment of the Company s projected cash flow
and business performance as of and subsequent to August 31, 2024, management believes that the Company s current cash and cash
availability under the TBK facility would be sufficient to support its operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of
this report. The Company's plan includes the items noted above as well as securing external financing which may include raising debt
or equity capital. These plans are not entirely within the Company's control including its ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable
terms, if at all, absent an infusion of sufficient capital there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
for twelve months after the date the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended August 31, 2024 are issued. 

Significant
estimates inherent in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements include determinations of the useful lives and
expected future cash flows of long-lived assets, including intangibles, valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations,
and estimates and assumptions in valuation of debt and equity instruments, including derivative liabilities. In addition, the Company
makes significant judgments to recognize revenue see policy note Revenue Recognition below. 

The
Company s business practices require, for accurate and meaningful disclosure, that it recognizes revenue over time. The over
time policy is the period from point of origin to arrival of the shipment at the Port of entry (or in the case when the customer
requires delivery to a designated point, the arrival at that delivery point). This overtime policy requires the Company to make significant
judgements to recognize revenue over the estimated duration of time from port of origin to arrival at port of entry. The point in the
process when the Company meets its obligation in the port of entry and the subsequent transfer of the goods to the customer is when the
customer has the obligation to pay, has taken physical possession, has legal title, risk and awards (ownership) and has accepted the
goods. The Company has elected to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that
are unsatisfied as of the end of the period as the Company s contracts with its customers have an expected duration of one year
or less. 

The
Company uses independent contractors and third-party carriers in the performance of its transportation services. The Company evaluates
who controls the transportation services to determine whether its performance obligation is to transfer services to the customer or to
arrange for services to be provided by another party. The Company determined it acts as the principal for its transportation services
performance obligation since it is in control of establishing the prices for the specified services, managing all aspects of the shipments
process and assuming the risk of loss for delivery and collection. 

Revenue
billed prior to realization is recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and contract costs incurred prior
to revenue recognition are recorded as contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Contract
Assets 

Contract
assets represent amounts for which the Company has the right to consideration for the services provided while a shipment is still in-transit
but for which it has not yet completed the performance obligation and has not yet invoiced the customer. Upon completion of the performance
obligations, which can vary in duration based upon the method of transport and billing the customer, these amounts become classified
within accounts receivable. 

Contract
Liabilities 

Contract
liabilities represent the amount of obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which consideration has been received.

Total revenue 

For purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The carrying amounts for financial
assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable - trade, contract assets, factoring reserve, other prepaid
expenses and current assets, accounts payable trade and other current liabilities, including contract liabilities, convertible
notes, promissory notes, all approximate fair value due to their short-term nature as of August 31, 2024, and May 31, 2024. The carrying
amount of the long-term debt approximates fair value because the interest rates on these instruments approximate the interest rate on
debt with similar terms available to the Company. Lease liabilities approximate fair value based on the incremental borrowing rate used
to discount future cash flows. The Company had Level 3 liabilities (See Derivative liabilities note) as of August 31, 2024, and May 31,
2024. There were no transfers between levels during the reporting period.

basis over to years. 

The
Company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of May 31 or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair

The
underlying value of the anti-dilution provision is calculated from estimating the probability and value of the provision assuming a near
term financing event. For the period ended August 31, 2024, based on the assumption of how antidilutive shares of Convertible Preferred
Series A, C and D would be exchanged in the near future for common stock, and the fact that the antidilution provision of these shares
is effective through December 31, 2024, the assumptions include probability of the financing event, estimated value of common stock at
the exchange point and estimated time to financing event.

Purchase
Price Allocation 

The Company obtained full control of Unique Singapore and consolidated this entity as of the acquisition date. GAAP
requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity
at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The acquisition method of accounting requires extensive use of
estimates and judgments to allocate the considerations transferred to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.

Amendment
to the financing agreement and a waiver 

As previously disclosed, on March 10, 2023, the Company entered into the Financing Agreement as borrower with certain
of its subsidiaries party thereto as guarantors, the Lenders, and the Agents, for an initial senior secured term loan in a principal amount
of and a delayed draft term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to . 

Effective March 1, 2024, the Parties entered into a waiver and amendment no. 2 to the Financing Agreement (the Second
Waiver ), whereby the Agents and the Lenders agreed to waive: (i) (a) that certain Event of Default (as defined in Section 9.01
of the Financing Agreement) that has occurred or may occur due to the Borrowers noncompliance with Section 7.03(a) of the Financing
Agreement for each of the fiscal quarters in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024 and for the fiscal quarter ending August 31, 2024 (the
 FCCR Event of Default ), (b) that certain Event of Default that has occurred or may occur due to the Borrowers noncompliance
with Section 7.03(b) of the Financing Agreement for each of the fiscal quarters in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024 and for the fiscal
quarter ending August 31, 2024 (the Liquidity Event of Default and (c) that certain Event of Default that has occurred
or may occur due to the Borrowers noncompliance with Section 7.03(c) of the Financing Agreement for each of the fiscal quarters
in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024 and for the fiscal quarter ending August 31, 2024 (together with the FCCR Event of Default and
the Liquidity Event of Default, the Specified Events of Default and (ii) interest at the post-default rate with respect
to the Specified Events of Default from the date such event occurred through the Second Waiver effective date. As noted above, the Company is still non-compliant with Section 7.03(c) of the Financing Agreement in the second
quarter ended November 30, 2024 and is currently working with the lender on a new waiver agreement. 

In
addition, pursuant to the Second Waiver, the borrowers agreed to (i) pay the administrative agent a non-refundable Waiver Fee in an aggregate
amount of , which was deemed fully earned on the effective date of the Second Waiver, and (ii) issue the origination agent
or its designee warrants, in form and substance satisfactory to the origination agent, entitling the holder thereof to purchase a number
of shares of the Company s common stock equal to the greater of (a) of enterprise value as calculated in a manner to be mutually
agreed and acceptable to the origination agent and the Company on a fully diluted basis and (b) , on terms, conditions and
in a form reasonably acceptable to origination agent, and having an exercise price of per share. 

The
anti-dilution provisions applicable to the warrants shall at no time be less favorable to the holder thereof than those accorded by the
parent to any other person on or after the effective date. The warrants shall be exercisable for a period of 7.5 years unless otherwise
agreed within the warrant agreement, which is currently being drafted. This contract did not meet qualification requirements to be classified
as equity because there is no explicit limit on the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement. Accordingly, the warrants
were classified as a liability as the issuer is obligated to settle the warrant by issuing a variable number of shares and the monetary
value of the obligation based on a predetermined fixed amount, variation in something other than the issuers stock price, in this case
the amount is the enterprise value of the Company at the time of the future financing event. As the warrants were not yet issued on the
balance sheet date, these expected warrants were recorded as other long-term liability with an estimated fair market value of 
as of May 31, 2024 and as of August 31, 2024. 

Due
to the unique nature of these warrants, which the Company anticipates will have an effective date of August 31, 2024, a Monte Carlo simulation
was necessary in order to properly perform the valuation. Monte Carlo simulation analysis is mathematically similar to that used in a
Black-Scholes option pricing model. However, in a Monte Carlo simulation, a computer is used to generate random price movements, which
are constrained by the expected volatility of the underlying security. Where each step in a binomial model contains two possible outcomes,
each step in a Monte Carlo simulation contains an unlimited number of potential outcomes. For the fair value of the warrants to be issued,
a simulation using a risk neutral drift factor, the risk-free rate, was used.

The
Company has identified and recorded these expected warrants (prior to issuance) due to the contractual nature of this liability as a
long-term liability. Once issued, these warrants will be reclassified into derivative liability as representing the rights of holders
of these warrants to receive certain shares of common stock upon qualified financing event. Accordingly, the Company is treating this

The
quarterly tax provision is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in the applicable
quarter. The Company recorded a provision for income tax expense of million, reflecting an effective tax rate of , and 
 million of income tax benefit, reflecting an effective tax rate of , for the three months ended August 31, 2024, and August 31,
2023, respectively. For the three-months ended August 31, 2024, our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate
primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance during the period. The Company has determined that it is not more likely than
not to recognize a portion of its federal, foreign and state deferred tax assets. For the three-months ended August 31, 2023, our effective tax
rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the foreign derived intangible income deduction. 

The
Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions
that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A
liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit
because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized
as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740. Interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax positions are required to be
calculated and would be classified as tax expense in the statement of operations. Interest expense in the amount of 
million has been recorded related to the unrecognized tax positions for the period ended August 31, 2024 and for the period ended
August 31, 2023. These reserves would impact income tax expense if released into income. The Company does not expect a change to its
unrealized tax position in the next twelve months. 

The Company has filed its income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various international jurisdictions. Tax
years 2020 and forward generally remain open for examination for federal and state tax purposes. Tax years 2017 and forward
generally remain open for examination for foreign tax purposes. To the extent utilized in future years tax returns, net
operating losses as of May 31, 2024 and 2023 will remain subject to examination until the respective tax year is
closed.

Industry Trends, Trade Conditions and Competition 

We
specialize in shipping by air and sea from Asia to the United States. Our business is thus intricately linked to the economic, political
and other market factors that impact trade and shipping in this sector. Geopolitical factors have resulted in United States importers
moving production from China to other countries in the region. This trend poses challenges to ensure that we meet the changing logistics
requirements of our customers and secure the capacity necessary by air or sea to successfully ship products for our customers from other
parts of Asia. 

Shipping
from Asia to the United States continues to be influenced by the conflicts in the Middle East. United States importers have
also been wary of the potential impact of East Coast dockworkers industrial action, first anticipated in October 2024 and now
deferred to, possibly, January 2025. In anticipation of such disruptions and the longer transit times on some shipping routes due to
the Middle East conflicts, customers have accelerated their shipping to protect inventory levels. This has
caused congestion and poses challenges for us to manage shipping capacity. 

Air
shipping volumes have increased as a result of accelerated shipping and another more recent trend: the increasing amount of air freight
volumes utilized by Chinese E-Commerce shipping companies. Increasing air shipping volumes and reduced air freight capacity for commercial
imports has increased air freight costs. 

United
States importers remain wary of the potential impact of further tariffs on imports from China and are starting to plan further
relocation of production in the longer term and even more accelerated shipping in the shorter term. We will likely begin to see the impact
of anticipated tariffs in our financial results for the last quarter of our fiscal year ending May 31, 2025.

The increase in total revenues for the three months
ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, is primarily due to increases in airfreight services revenue
and ocean freight and ocean services revenue, offset by a decrease in revenue from customs brokerage and other services. 

The increase in air freight revenue was due to
an approximately 68.7 increase in pricing (that is, the rates that we charge customers), which was responsible for 68.5 of the
total increase in airfreight services revenue, and an approximately 46.3 increase in volume during the three months ended August
31, 2024 compared to the comparable period of 2023. The increases in both pricing and volume were due to significant increases in
demand for air freight services due to geopolitical issues discussed above and the rerouting of vessels traveling from Asia to
Europe and the East Coast of the United States during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 compared to the quarter ended August 31,
2023. 

The increase in ocean freight revenue was due
to a price increase of approximately 117.6 for such services compared to the three-month period ended August 31, 2023, as shipping
demand picked up, which resulted in a 117.1 increase in ocean freight revenue period-over period, offset by a 17.1 decrease in
such revenue resulting from a 14.7 decrease in volume due to a shift by major customers to airfreight services, quarter over quarter. 

The decrease in revenue from custom brokerage
and other services during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the quarter ended August 31, 2023, was a result of
customers paying their own duties at the Company s encouragement.

 76.9 

The 76.9 increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a 97.1 increase in the cost of sales, offset by an
aggregate decrease in other operating expenses. The increase in the cost of sales in each of airfreight services, ocean freight and ocean
services, and contract logistics was primarily attributable to the increased revenues during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared
to the same period of 2023, as discussed above under Revenue . 

Gross
Margins 

Although revenue and direct costs both increased during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three
months ended August 31, 2023, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13.1 during the 2023 period to 9.1 during the
2024 period. This decrease was primarily the result of an increase in airfreight revenue that historically produces lower margins than
ocean freight revenue due to higher utilization during the 2024 period of spot market contracts as opposed to ocean freight minimum quantity
commitments that generally provide more favorable freight rates than the spot market. Gross margin is an important measurement of the
logistics company efficiency and profitability. The Company is focused on this and other measures when making strategic decisions and
investments. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

During the quarter ended August 31, 2024, total other expenses were approximately 0.4 million and consisted primarily
of 2.0 million of interest expense offset by change in fair value of derivative liabilities resulting in gain of 1.6 million. During
the quarter ended August 31, 2023, total other expenses consisted of 1.4 million of interest expense and a 0.2 million decrease in the
fair value of derivative liabilities. The increase in interest expense quarter over quarter was due to higher debt balances during the
quarter ended August 31, 2024, as borrowings under our line of credit with TBK Bank increased due to higher sales and payments made to
the shipping lines. Also, interest expense increased due to our restructuring of promissory notes due to ULHK in 2024 that resulted in
our issuing new notes that accrue interest to replace interest free notes. Changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities are due
to a reduction in the enterprise value of the Company that is a primary driver for the mark to market valuation adjustment. 

Income
Tax Expense (Benefit) 

Due
to cumulative taxable losses as of August 31, 2024, the Company established a
deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of 3.4 million which resulted in tax expense of 3.3 million as part of its
annual tax provision compared with income tax benefit of 0.5 million recorded during the three months ended August 31, 2023, based
on net loss before income taxes for that quarter. This deferred tax asset valuation allowance is reversable in future periods when
there will be sufficient cumulative taxable income.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The Company s principal
sources of cash are (i) cash generated from operations, (ii) borrowings available under its revolving line of credit and (iii) proceeds
from future debt or equity issuances. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of approximately 3.5 million, working capital
of 0.3 million, and 2.2 million available to draw under its TBK Facility. On September 12, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement
with TBK Bank (the TBK Facility to temporarily increase the credit limit under the TBK Facility from 25.0 million to 30.0
million for a period of six months. The Company has incurred net losses of 2.1 million and used cash for its operations in the amount
of 10.2 million during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 primarily due to the ramp up of accounts receivable and accounts payable during
the most recent quarter ended due to an increase in sales. The net losses and cash used in operations are indicators of substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are
issued. 

The Company is currently evaluating
several different strategies to enhance its liquidity position. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, pursuing additional
actions under its strategic plan, seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity
securities and seeking to extend the term of outstanding debt. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at
this time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the capital it needs to continue its operations on satisfactory
terms or at all. If capital is not available to the Company when, and in the amounts needed, the Company could be required to liquidate
its assets, cease or curtail operations, which could materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations, or seek
protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state proceedings. 

The Company is continually evaluating its liquidity requirements in light of its operating needs, growth initiatives
and capital resources. Based on its assessment of the Company s projected cash flow and business performance as of and subsequent
to August 31, 2024, management believes that the Company s current cash and cash availability under the TBK facility would be sufficient
to support its operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this report. The Company's plan includes the items noted
above as well as securing external financing which may include raising debt or equity capital. These plans are not entirely within the
Company's control including its ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, if at all, absent an infusion of sufficient capital
there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months after the date the condensed consolidated
financial statements for the quarter ended August 31, 2024 are issued. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Management
has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with our board of directors. In addition, there are
other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates
used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Adjusted
EBITDA 

We
define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, transaction gains and losses, other income,
merger and acquisition costs, impairment charges and certain other non-recurring items. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income as an indicator of
operating performance. We use adjusted EBITDA as a financial metric to measure the financial performance of the business because management
believes that it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities. For this reason,
we believe that adjusted EBITDA will also be useful to others, including our stockholders, as a valuable financial metric. 

Adjusted
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from
operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity.
In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes
that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure to be considered in isolation or as
a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should be read only in conjunction with our
condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, the Company recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we necessarily are
required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. 

As
of August 31, 2024, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management
necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based upon the evaluation described above,
that as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and require remediation in order to be effective
 at the reasonable assurance level . 

In
addition, our auditors identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the audit of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses
identified relate to the fact that we did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting
requirements, including (a) lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training
and experience and (b) we have not completed a full risk assessment of our internal control over financial reporting at the activity
level, including process documentation and testing. In the course of preparing the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2024,
we identified separate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which relates to the ineffective design and
implementation of information technology general controls ITGC combined with the lack of properly designed management
review controls to compensate for these deficiencies. The Company s ITGC deficiencies included improperly designed controls pertaining
to user access rights and segregation of duties over systems that are critical to the Company s system of financial reporting.
Management s general assessment of the above processes in light of the Company s size, maturity and complexity, as to the
design and effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, is that the key controls and procedures in each of these processes
provide reasonable assurance regarding reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company is not involved in any disputes and does not have any litigation matters pending that it believes could have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or
by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the Company s
executive officers or any of its subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, its common stock, any of its subsidiaries
or of the Company s or the Company s subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse
decision could have a material adverse effect. 

From
time to time, however, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in any such matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond
our control, including those set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, the occurrence
of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors
previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.
