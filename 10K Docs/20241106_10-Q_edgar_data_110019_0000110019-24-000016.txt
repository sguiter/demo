 Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 
 The impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions; 
 
 Development and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources; 
 
 The strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition; 
 
 Availability of supplies, including lower than anticipated volumes from third parties, and market demand; 
 
 Volatility of pricing including the effect of lower than anticipated energy commodity prices; 
 
 Changes in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction-related inputs, including skilled labor; 
 
 The impact of existing and future laws and regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental matters, and litigation, as well as our ability and the ability of other energy companies, with whom we conduct or seek to conduct business, to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and our ability to achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes; 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance practices; 
 
 The physical and financial risks associated with climate change; 
 
 Our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;

 Changes in U.S. governmental administration and policies; 
 
 Risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities; 
 
 Acts of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions; and 
 
 Additional risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
 Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. 
 In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise. 
 
 Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of those factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, as may be supplemented by disclosures in Part II, Item 1A.

Provisions were included in the Settlement that establish a moratorium on any Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended (NGA) Section 4 or 5 proceedings that would seek to place new rates in effect any earlier than January 1, 2026. The Settlement also provides that we file an NGA Section 4 general rate case with rates to be effective not later than April 1, 2028, unless (a) we have entered into a pre-filing settlement or (b) a Section 5 general rate case has been filed on or before April 1, 2028. 
 As a result of the Settlement, in January 2023, we refunded approximately million, including interest, associated with the decrease in federal tax rates due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform).

At December 31, 2023, we had accrued liabilities totaling approximately million , million of which is recorded in Accrued liabilities - Other and million of which is recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities - Other on the Balance Sheet. We are conducting environmental assessments and implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated costs. 
 The EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules, and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, review and updates to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile organic compounds and methane. We continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to Total property, plant, and equipment, net on the Balance Sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of these regulatory impacts at this time.

 million and million, respectively. These advances are represented by demand notes and are classified as Receivables - Advances to affiliate on the Balance Sheet. The interest rate on these intercompany demand notes is based upon the daily overnight investment rate paid on Williams excess cash at the end of each month, which was approximately percent at September 30, 2024. The interest income from these advances was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such interest income is included in Other (Income) and Other Expenses Miscellaneous other (income) expense, net on the Statement of Net Income. 
 We have employees. Services necessary to operate our business are provided to us by Williams and certain affiliates of Williams. We reimburse Williams and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments made (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and benefits) in connection with these services. Employees of Williams also provide general, administrative and management services to us, and we are charged for certain administrative expenses incurred by Williams. These charges are either directly identifiable or allocated to our assets. Direct charges are for goods and services provided by Williams at our request. Allocated charges are based on a three-factor formula, which considers revenues; property, plant, and equipment; and payroll. In management s estimation, the allocation methodologies used are reasonable and result in a reasonable allocation to us of our costs of doing business incurred by Williams. We have recorded million and million for the

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical Financial Statements and accompanying notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and with the Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 This analysis discusses financial results of our operations for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Variances due to changes in natural gas prices and transportation volumes have little impact on revenues, because under our rate design methodology, the majority of overall cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in our transportation rates. 
 Net Income for the first nine months of 2024 of 134.0 million decreased by (1.1) million, or (1) percent when compared to the 135.1 million recognized during the first nine months of 2023 due to the following significant variances: 
 Operating Revenues increased 1.8 million, or 1 percent, primarily driven by: 
 1.5 million increase in Natural gas transportation revenues primarily due to an additional billing day and an increase in short-term firm transportation; and 
 0.3 million increase in Other revenues from higher park and loan services; 
 Operating Expenses increased 8.0 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to: 
 9.6 million increase in Operation and Maintenance costs due to higher labor costs, electricity expense, and higher contract services related to pipeline maintenance inspection activities, partially offset by 
 1.9 million decrease in Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to absence of amortization in 2024 related to historical basis differences from the Northwest acquisition. 
 Other (Income) and Other Expenses had a 5.1 million favorable change primarily due to an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction as a result of increased capital expenditures. 
 
 Pipeline Expansion Projects 
 Ryckman Creek Loop 
 The Ryckman Creek Loop expansion involves an expansion of our existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from a receipt point in Northeast Oregon (Stanfield) to multiple delivery points in Southwest Wyoming. We plan to place the project in service as early as the fourth quarter of 2025 assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 50.5 MDth/d. 
 Stanfield South Project 
 The Stanfield South Project on our existing natural gas transmission system provides year round transportation capacity from a receipt point in Northeast Oregon (Stanfield) to multiple delivery points in Idaho. We plan to place the project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2025, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 80 Mdth/d.

Naughton Coal to Gas Conversion 
 The Naughton Coal to Gas Conversion project on our existing natural gas transmission system provides year round transportation capacity to a power plant in Southwest Wyoming. We plan to place the project into service as early as the first quarter of 2026, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 97 Mdth/d.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended) (Disclosure Controls) or our internal control over financial reporting (Internal Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Senior Vice President and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Environmental 
 While it is not possible for us to predict the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings involving governmental authorities under federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, we do not anticipate a material effect on our financial position if we were to receive an unfavorable outcome in any one or more of such proceedings. Our threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is 1 million.
