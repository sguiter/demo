 Asset Impairment 
 
 We evaluate property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include deteriorations in operating cash flows, the anticipated sale or disposal of an asset group, and other significant changes in business conditions. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, as a result of forecasted cash flow losses, the Company made the decision to exit the Ready-to-drink ("RTD") business. As a result, the Company performed a recoverability assessment over the RTD asset group in the second quarter of 2024, which indicated that the asset group was not recoverable, and we were required to determine the fair value of the business. Our fair value assessment indicated that the carrying value was in excess of the fair value, and an impairment of million of property, plant, and equipment was recognized in our Ready-to-drink beverages asset group. The impairment charge is included in Asset impairment in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Impairment charges are measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset group was based on expected future cash flows using Level 3 inputs under ASC 820. We can provide no assurance regarding the prospect of additional impairment charges in future periods.

and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in the Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily driven by changes in the amounts of executive compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes, the research and development tax credit, and the effect of cross-border tax laws. Our effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors, including the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 Management estimates that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as million within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of the lapsing of statutes of limitations. Approximately all of the million could affect net income when settled. The timing of cash settlement, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated for uncertain tax benefits.

 During the second quarter of 2022, the Company made grants to certain of the Company s named executive officers and certain other executive officers of performance-based restricted stock units (the "PBRSU Awards"). The PBRSU Awards included a relative TSR market condition over a performance period beginning on the date of grant. The units accrued over the performance period and were multiplied by a predefined percentage between to for the relative TSR measure, depending on the achievement attainment over the performance period based on the Company s absolute annualized TSR relative to the annualized TSR of the S P Food Beverage Select Industry Index (the "Index"). The fair value of the awards was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model with a weighted average grant-date fair value of on approximately units granted in 2022. The PBRSU Awards vested in the second quarter of 2024. Over the performance period, the achievement attainment percentage was , resulting in no payout of the awards. 
 
 These awards will be converted to stock or cash, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, generally, on the third anniversary of the grant date with the exception of the PBRSU Awards on the second anniversary. The Company intends to settle these awards in stock and has the shares available to do so. 
 
 Performance unit awards with market conditions are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock price, average Peer Group stock price, or the total return value of the Index. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term equivalent to the expected term of the award. The expected term is the time period from the grant date to the end of the performance period.

 Shareholder Derivative Actions 
 
 The Company, as nominal defendant, and certain of its former officers are parties to a consolidated shareholder derivative suit captioned Wells and the City of Ann Arbor Employees Retirement System v. Reed, et al. , Case Nos. 2016-CH-16359 and 2019-CH-06753 (Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois). 
 
 The consolidated lawsuit alleges that TreeHouse, under the authority and control of the individual defendants: (i) made certain false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and future prospects; and (ii) failed to disclose that (a) the Company's private label business was underperforming; (b) the Company's Flagstone Foods business was underperforming; (c) the Company's acquisition strategy was underperforming; (d) the Company had overstated its full-year 2016 guidance; and (e) TreeHouse's statements lacked reasonable basis. The complaints allege, among other things, that these actions artificially inflated the market price of TreeHouse common stock and resulted in harm to the Company. 
 
 On August 26, 2022, plaintiffs in the consolidated Wells case filed a second consolidated amended complaint, which was dismissed in its entirety with prejudice on March 15, 2023. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on March 16, 2023. On March 22, 2024, the Appellate Court reversed the state trial court s dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint and remanded to the state trial court for further proceedings. On October 1, 2024, the parties advised the state trial court of their entry into a term sheet reflecting an agreement in principle to settle the action, as to which the parties are in the process of preparing a Stipulation of Settlement. On the same day, the court entered an order staying all proceedings pending the submission of a motion for preliminary settlement approval.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Business Overview 
 TreeHouse is a leading private brands snacking and beverage manufacturer in North America. Our purpose is to engage and delight - one customer at a time. Through our customer focus and category experience, we strive to deliver excellent service, build capabilities and provide insights to drive mutually profitable growth for both TreeHouse and our customers. Our purpose is supported by investments in depth, capabilities and operational efficiencies which are aimed to capitalize on the long-term growth prospects within the categories where we operate. 
 TreeHouse believes it is well positioned across attractive snacking and beverage growth categories fueled by strong underlying consumer demand trends. Our portfolio includes snacking offerings (crackers, pretzels, in-store bakery items, frozen griddle items, cookies, and unique candy offerings), beverages drink mix offerings (non-dairy creamer, coffee, broths/stocks, powdered beverages and other blends, tea, and ready-to-drink-beverages), as well as other grocery offerings (pickles, refrigerated dough, hot cereal, and cheese pudding). The Company sells its products across various channels including retail grocery, co-manufacturing, and food-away-from-home customers in shelf stable, refrigerated, and frozen formats. TreeHouse also offers its customer partners a range of value and nutritional solutions, including natural, organic and gluten free offerings, providing each the capability to meet the unique needs of their consumers. 
 The following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to those Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions associated with these statements. 

Recent Developments 
 
 Impact of Griddle Voluntary Recall 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, our results of operations were impacted by a voluntary recall of frozen griddle products produced at our Brantford, Ontario, Canada facility that are still within their shelf-life. As we restart production at the Brantford facility, we expect to have impacts to our results of operations, including decreased sales volumes and plant shutdown costs. Refer to Note 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 The Company is seeking to recover the recall-related costs through its insurance coverage, and such recoveries are recorded in the period in which the recoveries are determined to be probable of realization. 
 
 Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Related Business Exit 
 
 We evaluate property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include deteriorations in operating cash flows, the anticipated sale or disposal of an asset group, and other significant changes in business conditions. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, as a result of forecasted cash flow losses, the Company made the decision to exit the Ready-to-drink ("RTD") business. As a result, the Company performed a recoverability assessment over the RTD asset group in the second quarter of 2024, which indicated that the asset group was not recoverable, and we were required to determine the fair value of the business. Our fair value assessment indicated that the carrying value was in excess of the fair value, and an impairment of 19.3 million of property, plant, and equipment was recognized in our Ready-to-drink beverages asset group. The impairment charge is included in Asset impairment in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 The production for the RTD business is expected to cease during the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Restoration of One of our Broth Facilities 
 
 Since the end of 2023, our results of operations have been impacted by a voluntary recall of certain broth products produced at our Cambridge, Maryland broth facility and the subsequent restoration of this facility. The restoration has impacted our results of operations throughout the first nine months of 2024, as we incurred costs to restore and upgrade our broth facility to full production capacity. During the first half of 2024, the Company successfully restored the key broth production lines and substantially completed upgrades to the facility. The Company continues to advance production capacity for the category's increased seasonal demand. 
 
 The Company is seeking to recover the recall-related costs through its insurance coverage, and such recoveries are recorded in the period in which the recoveries are determined to be probable of realization. 
 
 Acquisition of Pickle Branded Assets 
 
 On January 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of pickle branded assets, including Bick s pickles, Habitant pickled beets, Woodman s horseradish, and McLarens pickled onions brands, from The J.M. Smucker Co., a North American producer of coffee, consumer foods, dog snacks, and cat food, for a total purchase price of 25.9 million in cash. The allocation of the purchase price consists primarily of inventory. The acquisition is consistent with our strategy and builds depth in our Pickles category by expanding into Canada. Refer to Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Trends 
 
 Significant inflationary pressure and rising interest rates have contributed to sluggish overall food and beverage consumption trends. However, in the categories where TreeHouse operates, private brands have consistently gained unit market share compared to national brands, which we believe demonstrates the continued strength of the private brands market. 
 
 While we have seen some commodity prices move lower relative to recent all-time highs, many of our ingredients and packaging input costs still remain elevated compared to historical levels, such as the prices of coffee and cocoa in particular. In response, we have implemented pricing actions to recover inflationary coffee and cocoa costs. We will continue to monitor the inflationary environment to determine if additional pricing actions to recover inflationary costs will be necessary.

 Net Sales Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 839.1 million compared to 863.3 million for the same period last year, a decrease of 24.2 million, or 2.8 . The change in net sales from 2023 to 2024 was due to the following:

 (1) Organic net sales is a Non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the "Non-GAAP Measures" section for additional information. 
 
 The net sales decrease of 2.8 was primarily due to a voluntary recall of frozen griddle products. Additionally, unfavorable volume/mix performance was negatively impacted by approximately 5 million to 10 million due to Hurricane Helene, which disrupted distribution in the Southeastern region of the United States. Targeted commodity-driven pricing adjustments in select categories also contributed to the decline. 
 Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 15.6 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 15.9 in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points. The decrease in Gross profit is primarily due to a voluntary recall of frozen griddle products, which impacted Gross profit by 3.2 percentage points. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 18.9 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 17.3 in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 1.6 percentage points. The increase in Adjusted gross profit was primarily due to the execution of supply chain initiatives. 
 Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were 99.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 103.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 4.5 million. The decrease is due to lower freight costs, lower costs for growth, reinvestment, and restructuring programs, and lower employee incentive compensation expense. This was partially offset by the lapping of TSA income. 
 Total Other Expense Total other expense was 36.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 20.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase in expense of 16.0 million. This was primarily due to a 17.5 million unfavorable change in non-cash mark-to-market impact from hedging activities, largely driven by interest rate swaps. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest income of 10.9 million from the Seller Promissory Note, which was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by a favorable currency exchange rate impact of 5.4 million between the U.S. and Canada, a decrease of 4.9 million in interest expense due to a decrease in borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, and a decrease of 1.7 million in costs related to the Receivables Sales Program due to decreased usage. 
 Income Taxes Income taxes were recognized at an effective rate of 20.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 27.4 recognized in the third quarter of 2023. The change in the Company s effective tax rate is primarily driven by changes in the amounts of executive compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes, the research and development tax credit, and the effect of cross-border tax laws. 
 
 32 

Our effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 
 Discontinued Operations Net loss from discontinued operations decreased by 2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease is primarily a result of a non-recurring net loss from the Snack Bars Business due to its divestiture on September 29, 2023. Refer to Note 6 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

 Continuing Operations 
 
 Net Sales Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 2,448.3 million compared to 2,520.8 million for the same period last year, a decrease of 72.5 million, or 2.9 . The change in net sales from 2023 to 2024 was due to the following: 
 
 Dollars Percent (In millions) 2023 Net sales 2,520.8 Business acquisitions 57.9 2.3 Pricing (50.7) (2.0) Volume/mix (39.2) (1.5) Facility restoration impact (25.2) (1.0) Product recall returns (14.6) (0.6) Foreign currency (0.7) (0.1) 2024 Net sales 2,448.3 (2.9) Volume/mix related to business acquisitions 
 (2.3) Foreign currency 0.1 Percent change in organic net sales (5.1) 
 
 The net sales decrease of 2.9 was primarily due to targeted commodity-driven pricing adjustments in select categories. Additionally, the decrease was due to unfavorable volume/mix related to planned distribution exits and the restoration of one of our broth facilities, as well as the voluntary recall of frozen griddle products. These items were partially offset by volume/mix from the acquisition of the Coffee Roasting Capability, as well as new business wins. 
 
 Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 15.2 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 16.8 in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points. The decrease is primarily due to a voluntary recall of frozen griddle products, which impacted Gross profit by 1.1 percentage points, costs incurred from the restoration of one of our broth facilities related to the broth recall, and increased costs for labor investment. This was partially offset by favorable commodity costs and the execution of supply chain savings initiatives. 
 
 Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were 348.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 319.5 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 29.4 million. The increase in expense was primarily due to a decrease in TSA income of 34.6 million and a non-cash impairment charge of 19.3 million related to the Ready-to-drink beverages asset group recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 7 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. This was partially offset by 12.4 million of lower freight costs, lower employee incentive compensation expense, and TSA-related expense reductions. 
 Total Other Expense Total other expense was 63.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 32.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 30.9 million. The increase in expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of 32.3 million from the Seller Promissory Note, which was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, an unfavorable change of 12.5 million in non-cash mark-to-market impacts from hedging activities, largely driven by interest rate swaps, and unfavorable currency exchange rate impacts of 2.5 million between the U.S. and Canada contributed to the increase in expense. This was partially offset by a decrease of 10.7 million in interest expense, primarily due to a decrease in borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, and a decrease of 4.4 million in costs related to the Receivables Sales Program due to decreased usage. 

35 

Income Taxes Income taxes were recognized at an effective rate of 21.5 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 27.5 recognized in the first nine months of 2023. The change in the Company's effective tax rate is primarily driven by changes in the amounts of executive compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes, the research and development tax credit, and the effect of cross-border tax laws. 
 
 Our effective tax rate may change from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the jurisdictional mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, settlement of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 
 Discontinued Operations Net loss from discontinued operations decreased by 7.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease is primarily a result of a non-recurring net loss from the Snack Bars Business due to its divestiture on September 29, 2023. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized an expected loss on disposal adjustment of 2.8 million related to the divestiture of a significant portion of the Meal Preparation business on October 3, 2022. Refer to Note 6 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvesting in existing businesses, conducting acquisitions, and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. 
 
 Receivables Sales Program 
 
 The Company has the ability to strategically manage customer payment terms and counterparty risk by selling receivables in a cost-effective manner through its Receivables Sales Program. Approximately 258.5 million was available under the Receivables Sales Program limit as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, usage of the Receivables Sales Program decreased when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the Company's strong cash balance position. See Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Receivables Sales Program. Our Receivables Sales Program provides us lower cost access to liquidity when compared to the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 If additional borrowings are needed, approximately 468.6 million was available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility. We are in compliance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and expect to meet foreseeable financial requirements. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock at a weighted average share price of 36.20 for a total of 88.7 million. There were no share repurchases during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 through November 11, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock at a weighted average share price of 37.65 for a total of 50.0 million. See Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock repurchase program. 
 
 Cash Flo w 
 
 The following table is derived from our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Net Cash Flows (Used In) Provided By: 
 Operating activities of continuing operations (30.4) 11.0 Investing activities of continuing operations (90.2) (179.3) Financing activities of continuing operations (97.3) 98.7 Cash flows from discontinued operations 44.8 
 
 37 

Operating Activities From Continuing Operations 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was 30.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of 11.0 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase in cash used of 41.4 million. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash flows from the Receivables Sales Program due to reduced factoring utilization. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Receivables Sales Program. Additionally, the increase in net cash used was driven by lower cash earnings. This was partially offset by an increase in cash flow from accounts payable due to improved working capital management. 

Investing Activities From Continuing Operations 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 90.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 179.3 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease in cash used of 89.1 million. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the non-recurring 102.2 million of cash used in the second quarter of 2023 for the acquisitions of the seasoned pretzel and coffee roasting capabilities and the exercise of a purchase option on the lease of our Cambridge, Maryland facility for 8.1 million during the first quarter of 2023. This activity was partially offset by an increase in remaining capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024 related to growth initiatives and integration activities from recent acquisitions. 

Financing Activities From Continuing Operations 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 97.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 98.7 million net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2023, an increase in cash used of 196.0 million. The increase in cash used is due to a non-recurring cash inflow from the Revolving Credit Facility of 155.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 and incremental common stock repurchases of 38.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows From Discontinued Operations 
 
 There was no cash provided by discontinued operations in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 44.8 million in cash provided by discontinued operations in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease in cash provided of 44.8 million. The decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations is due to the completion of the sale of the Snack Bars Business on September 29, 2023, which resulted in a non-recurring cash inflow of 61.3 million from the buyer. The cash provided was partially offset by the finalization of the purchase price of the Meal Preparation business during the first nine months of 2023, which resulted in a cash payment of 15.2 million to the buyer. Refer to Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Debt Obligations 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 316.4 million outstanding under Term Loan A, 588.6 million outstanding under Term Loan A-1, 500.0 million of the 2028 Notes outstanding, and 3.2 million of finance lease obligations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had remaining availability of 468.6 million under its 500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, and there were 31.4 million in letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility that were issued but undrawn, which have been included as a reduction to the calculation of available credit. 
 
 The Company has long-term interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate base in order to mitigate the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2024, we have an outstanding variable-rate debt balance of 905.0 million, and our interest rate swap agreements have a notional value of 1,750.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements, 875.0 million of interest rate swaps mature on February 28, 2025, and the remaining 875.0 million of interest rate swaps, which are effective February 28, 2025, mature on February 29, 2028. As a result, our variable-rate debt is nearly fully hedged with our fixed rate interest rate swaps. 
 
 38 

The Credit Agreement contains various financial and restrictive covenants and requires that the Company maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.50 to 1.0, and our debt obligations contain customary representations and events of default. We are in compliance with all applicable debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 See Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our debt obligations.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP ("Non-GAAP"). A Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As described further below, we believe these measures provide useful information to the users of the financial statements. 
 
 For each of these Non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation between the Non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why management believes the Non-GAAP measure provides useful information to financial statement users, and any additional purposes for which management uses the Non-GAAP measure. This Non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for the financial statement users and is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures may be different from similar measures used by other companies. 
 
 Organic Net Sales 
 
 Organic net sales is defined as net sales excluding the impacts of business acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's sales between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as Company management. 
 
 EBITDA from Continuing Operations, EBITDA from Continuing Operations Margin, Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations, and Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations Margin, Adjusting for Certain Items Affecting Comparability 
 
 EBITDA from continuing operations margin is defined as EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of adjusted net sales. EBITDA from continuing operations represents net (loss) income from continuing operations before interest expense, interest income, income tax (benefit) expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations reflects adjustments to EBITDA from continuing operations to identify items that, in management s judgment, significantly affect the assessment of earnings results between periods. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company s earnings performance between periods and to view the Company s business from the same perspective as Company management. As the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of charges that include, but are not limited to, items such as product recalls and related costs, growth, reinvestment, and restructuring programs, acquisition, integration, divestiture, and related costs, impairment of assets, foreign currency exchange impact on the re-measurement of intercompany notes, mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts, and other items that may arise from time to time that would impact comparability, management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company s performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation, or in determining earnings estimates. EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are performance measures commonly used by management to assess operating performance and incentive compensation, and the Company believes they are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measure of a company s operating performance between periods and as a component of our debt covenant calculations.

Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Total Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating (Loss) Income, Adjusted Total Other Expense (Income), Adjusted Income Tax Expense (Benefit), Adjusted Net (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share from Continuing Operations, Adjusting for Certain Items Affecting Comparability 
 
 Adjusted net sales, adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross profit, adjusted total operating expenses, adjusted operating (loss) income, adjusted total other expense (income), adjusted income tax expense (benefit), and adjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations represent their respective GAAP presentation line item adjusted for items such as product recalls and related costs, growth, reinvestment, and restructuring programs, acquisition, integration, divestiture, and related costs, impairment of assets, foreign currency exchange impact on the re-measurement of intercompany notes, mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts, and other items that may arise from time to time that would impact comparability. Management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company s performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation, or in determining earnings estimates. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company s earnings performance between periods and to view the Company s business from the same perspective as Company management. The Company has presented each of these adjusted Non-GAAP measures as a percentage of adjusted net sales compared to its respective reported GAAP presentation line item as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations ("Adjusted diluted EPS") is determined by dividing adjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects adjustments to GAAP earnings (loss) per diluted share to identify items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the assessment of earnings results between periods.

Free Cash Flow From Continuing Operations 
 
 In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow from continuing operations (a Non-GAAP measure) which represents net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides management and investors a measure of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions, repaying debt, repurchasing public debt, and repurchasing our common stock. 
 
 The following table reconciles cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities from continuing operations (a GAAP measure) to our free cash flow from continuing operations (a Non-GAAP measure). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities from continuing operations 
 (30.4) 11.0 Less: Capital expenditures (91.6) (77.1) Free cash flow from continuing operations (122.0) (66.1)
