Forward Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical
fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include our current expectations
and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can
identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may
include words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, plan, 
 intend, believe, may, will, should, can have, likely 
and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future cash flows, operating
or financial performance or other events. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations,
estimates and projections about our industry and Company, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many
of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that any such forward looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult
to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made,
results may prove to be materially different. Unless otherwise required by law, we disclaim any obligation to update our view of any such
risks or uncertainties or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made in this report. 

Factors that could cause
our actual results and our financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, the following: 

trends
in the cannabis industry and SpringBig s market size, including with respect to the potential total addressable market in the industry; 

SpringBig s
growth prospects; 

new
product and service offerings SpringBig may introduce in the future; 

the
price of SpringBig s securities, including volatility resulting from changes in the competitive and highly regulated industry in
which SpringBig operates and plans to operate, variations in performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting
SpringBig s business and changes in the combined capital structure; 

the
ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations, and identify and realize additional opportunities; and 

other
risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

These risks are not exhaustive.
New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the
impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should
any of the assumptions made by the management of SpringBig prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected
in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact the operations and projections
discussed herein can be found in the section entitled Risk Factors and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Our SEC filings
are available publicly on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 

You should read this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity and performance as well as
other events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these
cautionary statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 

SpringBig is a market-leading
software platform providing customer loyalty and marketing automation solutions to retailers and brands. We have leveraged our deep expertise
in loyalty marketing to develop solutions that address the key challenges faced by retailers and brands, including those in the cannabis
industry. Stringent, complex, and rapidly evolving regulations have resulted in restricted access to traditional marketing and advertising
channels for cannabis retailers and brands, preventing them from utilizing many traditional methods for effectively accessing and engaging
with consumers. In addition, the lack of industry-specific data and market intelligence solutions limit cannabis retailers and
brands ability to efficiently market their products, thereby hindering their growth. Our platform enables our clients to increase
brand awareness, engage customers, improve retention, and access actionable consumer feedback data to improve marketing. Our clients can
use our loyalty marketing, digital communications, and text/email/push marketing solutions to drive new customer acquisition, customer
spend and retail foot traffic. Our proven B2B2C software platform creates powerful network effects between retailers and brands and provides
an ability for both to connect directly with consumers. As retailers and brand scale, a virtuous cycle amplifies growth, ultimately expanding
SpringBig s reach and strengthening our value proposition. 

SpringBig serves approximately
1,000 retail and brand clients across more than 2,500 distinct retail locations in North America. Our clients distribute more than 600
million messages annually, via text, push or email, and in the last year more than 7.7 billion of gross merchandise value was accounted
for by clients utilizing our platform. 

On June 14, 2022, SpringBig
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Tuatara Capital Acquisition Corporation), consummated a business combination
of Tuatara and Legacy SpringBig, a Delaware corporation. Pursuant to the merger agreement, prior to the closing of the business combination,
Tuatara changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by deregistering as a Cayman Islands exempted company and continuing and domesticating
as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to the closing date, and in connection with the Closing,
Tuatara changed its name to SpringBig Holdings, Inc. 

As a consequence of the business
combination, Legacy SpringBig became the successor to an SEC-registered and Nasdaq-listed company, which required us to implement procedures
and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. On September 5, 2023, SpringBig Holdings, Inc.
was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and its common stock is now quoted for trading on the OTCQX Best Market. 

Recent Developments 

On November 11, 2024, the
Company amended the terms of the 12 Secured Term Notes and 8 Secured Convertible Notes including extending the maturity date to January
23, 2027, amending the interest rates and adjusting the requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance of at least 1
million with the provision now applicable only at the end of any calendar month commencing on or after February 1, 2025. Further details
are included in the Liquidity Capital Resources section of this item. 

Key Operating and Financial Metrics 

We monitor the following key financial and operational metrics to evaluate
our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.
The following is our analysis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, in thousands:

For a reconciliation of net loss to

Revenue 

We generate revenue from
the sale of monthly subscriptions that provide retail clients with access to an integrated platform through which they can manage loyalty
programs and communications with their consumers. We also generate additional revenue from these retail clients when the quantum of messages
sent to consumers exceeds the amounts in the subscription package. The subscriptions generally have twelve-month terms (which typically
are not subject to early termination without a cancellation fee payable by the client), are payable monthly, and automatically renew for
subsequent and recurring twelve-month periods unless notice of cancellation is provided in advance. 

22 

The Company s revenue
growth is generally achieved through a mix of new clients, clients upgrading their subscriptions (as new clients will frequently enter
into a relatively low level of subscription (with respect to the size of such client s database and the number of their customers
on such database) and/or the number of pre-determined communication credits), which frequently occurs shortly after such a client initially
becomes a client, and the excess use element of revenues. Excess use revenues are revenues derived from amounts charged
to clients for exceeding the pre-determined credit volume set forth in the applicable client s subscription agreement. Given this
combination, and particularly the tendency for clients to upgrade soon after becoming a client, the Company does not actively monitor
revenue split between new and existing clients, preferring to use the split between subscription and excess use in combination with net
dollar retention and the number of clients as key metrics, as described below. 

Other Key Operating Metrics 

The growth in our revenues
is a key metric at this stage in our development as a Company and therefore to provide investors with additional information, we have
disclosed in the table above the number of our retail clients, our net revenue retention rate and the number of messages distributed through
the SpringBig platform by our clients. We regularly review the key operating and financial metrics set forth above to evaluate our business,
our growth, assess our performance and make decisions regarding our business. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both
because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making,
and they may be helpful in evaluating the state and growth of our business. 

Number of Retail Clients. 
We disclose in the table above the number of discrete SpringBig platforms used by clients of the business at the end of the relevant period.
We view this number as an important metric to assess the performance of our business because an increased number of clients drives growth,
increases brand awareness and helps contribute to our reach and strengthening our value proposition. 

Net Revenue Retention. 
We believe that the growth in the use of our platform by our clients is an important metric in evaluating our business and growth. We
monitor our dollar-based net revenue retention rate on a rolling basis to track the maintenance of revenue and revenue-increasing activity
growth. Net revenue retention rate (also referred to as net dollar retention rate does not have a standardized
meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and further, investors should
not consider it in isolation. When evaluating our retention rates and calculating our net revenue retention rate, SpringBig calculates
the recurring monthly subscription revenue from retail clients, adjusted for losses, increases and decreases in monthly subscriptions
during the prior twelve months divided by the recurring monthly subscription revenue at the start of the trailing twelve-month period.
The net revenue retention is calculated based on subscription revenues only and does not include the impact of excess use revenue. 

Number of Messages Sent. 
We believe that the volume of messages sent is important as it indicates the frequency of use and level of engagement of our platform
by our clients. Messages are distributed by text, email, and direct push notifications to mobile applications. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 

To provide investors with
additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate
as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA adjusted for certain
unusual, infrequent items, or non-cash items (such as credit loss expense and stock-based compensation). 

We present EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future
operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of investment capacity. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner
as our management and board of directors, and is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors to measure a company s operating
performance. 

23 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
have limitations, and you should not consider these in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP,
including net loss, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Some of these limitations are: 

although
depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA
nor Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 

EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 

EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available. 

Because of these limitations,
you should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results. 

A reconciliation of net loss
before taxes to non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):

Factors Affecting Our
Performance 

Overall Economic Trends 

The overall economic environment
and related changes to consumer behavior have a significant impact on our business. Overall, positive conditions in the broader economy
promote consumer spending on marketplaces and our customers products, while economic weakness, which generally results in reduced
consumer spending, may have a negative impact on our customers sales, which in turn may impact our revenue. 

Growth and Retention of
Customers 

Our revenue grows primarily
through acquiring and retaining customers and expanding relationships with customers over time, increasing the revenue per customer. We
have historically been able to attract, retain and grow relationships with customers as a result of the Company s comprehensive
product suite, differentiated loyalty programs, consistent communications with customers, and reliable customer service. 

24 

Regulation and Maturation
of Cannabis Markets 

We believe that we will have
significant opportunities for growth as more jurisdictions legalize cannabis for medical and/or adult use and the regulatory environment
continues to develop. We intend to explore new expansion opportunities as additional jurisdictions legalize cannabis for medical or adult
use and leverage our existing business model to enter new markets. We believe our understanding of the space coupled with our experienced
sales force will enable us to quickly enter and execute in new markets and capture new business, which we sustain via our best-in-class
product offerings. Further, a change in U.S. federal regulations could result in our ability to engage in additional outlets, including
the fintech, payments and e-commerce space. 

We expect competition to
intensify in the future as the regulatory regime for cannabis becomes more settled and the legal market for cannabis becomes more accepted,
which may encourage new participants to enter the market, including established companies with substantially greater financial, technical
and other resources than existing market participants. 

We believe that maintaining
and enhancing our brand identity and our reputation is critical to maintaining and growing our relationships with customers and to our
ability to attract new customers. 

We believe our platform s
scale and strong customer loyalty market themselves; however, we implement a variety of marketing efforts to attract the remaining retailers
and brands not yet on our platform. Marketing efforts include multiple strategies designed to attract and retain both retail and brands
subscribers. 

Negative publicity, whether
or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, customers or others associated with any of these parties,
may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Given our high visibility, we may be more susceptible to the risk of negative
publicity. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand may be
costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful. 

We also believe that the
importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in our market continues to develop. If our
brand promotion activities are not successful, our operating results and growth may be adversely impacted. 

Components of Our Results
of Operations 

Revenue 

SpringBig provides its retail
customers with access to an integrated platform that provides all the functions of the Company s proprietary software, which uses
proprietary technology to send text, email, and push messages to the customer s contacts. This access is provided to customers under
a contract, with revenue generated from monthly subscriptions for credits (up to the pre-contracted amount) and optional purchases of
additional credits. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue consists
primarily of amounts payable to distributors of messages on behalf of the Company s customers across cellular networks and integrations. 

Selling, Servicing and
Marketing Expenses 

Selling, servicing and marketing
expenses consist of salaries, benefits, travel expense and incentive compensation for our sales, servicing and marketing employees. In
addition, sales, servicing and marketing expenses include business acquisition marketing, events cost, and branding and advertising costs. 

25 

Technology and Software
Development Expenses 

Technology and software development
costs consist of salaries and benefits for employees, including engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products,
as well as maintaining and improving existing products. We evaluate whether to capitalize certain costs associated with technology and
software development in accordance with ASC 350-40, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal Use Software , but these
are limited in quantum as we are constantly and regularly making enhancements to our technology platform and do not consider them appropriate
to be capitalized. To the limited extent any costs are capitalized, the costs are generally amortized over a three-year period commencing
on the date that the specific software product is placed in service. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important
for our growth. 

General and Administrative
Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits costs for our employees involved in general corporate functions including finance,
human resources and investor relations, as well as costs associated with the use by these functions of software and equipment. All rent,
insurance and other occupancy costs are also included in general and administrative expenses as are professional and outside services
related to legal, audit and other services, and stock compensation expenses.

Revenues . Revenues
decreased 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 7 year-on-year reduction compared with the same
period in 2023. Our subscription revenue was 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 5.4 million in
the same quarter in 2023, representing 4 year-over-year decline and is impacted by the Company having to cease providing access to our
platform to clients who became delinquent in their payments. This is also impacting our net revenue retention which is 88 for the twelve-month
period ended September 30, 2024. The excess use revenue also declined, by 27 year-over-year due to the weaker economy impacting the cannabis
sector and our clients being budget-conscious in limiting their messaging activity to within the volumes of their subscription. SpringBig
has expanded its product offerings during the current year, including the introduction of a paid-for consumer VIP loyalty tier that retail
clients can operate in conjunction with their standard loyalty program, and offering clients the ability to incorporate gift cards as
a payment option for consumers within their digital rewards wallet. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we derived
revenue of 0.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively, from these new products. 

26 

Our net revenue retention
rate was 88 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 100 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting
the challenging macroeconomic conditions of the cannabis market and the financial stress of some of our retail clients leading to the
Company having to suspend or cease some access to our platform. The net revenue retention rate of 88 for the twelve months ended September
30, 2024, compares with 86 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. 

Gross Profit .
Gross profit decreased by 0.8 million to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.3 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 16 year-on-year reduction. In part this reduction was due to the 0.5 million
decline in revenues and additionally our cost of revenue increased due to higher messaging distribution costs which represent the
main expense in our cost of revenue. The gross profit margin reduced from 77 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 69 
for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating Expenses .
We have consistently focused on right sizing the operating expenses of the business to accelerate our path to sustainable profitability
in the challenging macroeconomic conditions that prevail across the cannabis market, and which impacts revenue in the near-term. 

Our operating expenses decreased
by 3.5 million, or 44 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. Excluding costs relating
to settlement of litigation expensed in the three months ended September 30, 2023, our operating expenses reduced by 2.4 million, or
35 . 

Selling, servicing and marketing expenses decreased by 0.8 million,
or 42 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to lower compensation expense as a result of
lower employee headcount. 

Technology and software development
expenses decreased by 0.3 million, or 14 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, with the decrease
being attributable to lower expenses associated with the use of offshore contract developers and a reduction in compensation expense. 

General and administrative
expenses decreased by 2.4 million, or 58 , for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The expenses
in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, included 1.0 million relating to settlement of litigation; excluding this prior year expense
the decrease was 1.4 million, or 44 , being attributable to lower insurance fees, legal and accounting advisory fees, investor relations
costs and a reduction in our credit loss expense. 

Interest Expense .
Interest expense was 0.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.4 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2023. 

Change in fair value of
warrants . The liability relating to warrants issued by SpringBig is included
on the balance sheet at the fair value prevailing at the end of the accounting period and any change in value is reported in the income
statement. At September 30, 2024, the market value of the public warrants, which are quoted for trading on the OTC Pink Market, was 0.0008
per warrant compared with 0.0034 at September 30, 2024. The decrease in value, which is recognized as a credit in our income statement
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 41,000.

Revenues . Revenues
decreased 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 8 year-on-year reduction compared with the same period
in 2023. Our subscription revenue was 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 16.6 million in the same
quarter in 2023, representing 3 year-over-year decline and is impacted by the Company having to cease providing access to our platform
to clients who became delinquent in their payments. The excess use revenue also declined, by 31 year-over-year due to the weaker economy
in particular impacting the cannabis sector and our clients being budget-conscious in limiting their messaging activity to within the
volumes of their subscription. 

Gross Profit . Gross
profit decreased by 3.0 million to 13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, representing a 18 year-on-year reduction. In part this reduction was due to the 1.7 million decline in revenues
and additionally our cost of revenue increased due to higher messaging distribution costs which represent the main expense in our cost
of revenue. The gross profit margin reduced from 79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 71 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Operating Expenses .
Our operating expenses decreased by 8.8 million, or 38 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period
in 2023. Excluding costs relating to settlement of litigation expensed in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating expenses
reduced by 7.7 million, or 35 . 

Selling, servicing and marketing
expenses decreased by 2.8 million, or 43 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to
lower compensation expense as a result of lower employee headcount. 

Technology and software development
expenses decreased by 1.7 million, or 27 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, with the
decrease being attributable to lower expenses associated with the use of offshore contract developers and a reduction in compensation
expense. 

General and
administrative expenses decreased by 4.3 million, or 42 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period
in 2023. Excluding costs relating to settlement of litigation expensed in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our general and
administrative expenses decreased by 3.3 million, or 36 , with the decrease being largely attributable to lower costs, including
insurance, directors fees, legal and accounting advisory fees, and investor relations fees, due to being quoted for trading
on the OTCQX Best Market rather than listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and a lower credit loss expense. 

Interest Expense .
Interest expense was 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, with the increase being due to interest payable on cash advances used as bridging finance prior to completing the transaction
to raise 8.0 million of debt financing. 

Gain on note repurchase .
The gain on the repurchase of the 6 Senior Secured Note is the difference between the cash paid to repurchase the entire obligation of
 2.9 million and the outstanding principal and accrued interest of 5.2 million, less unamortized discounts and warrant value of 0.7
million. 

28 

Change in fair value of
warrants . The liability relating to warrants issued by SpringBig is included on the balance sheet at the fair value prevailing at
the end of the accounting period and any change in value is reported in the income statement. At September 30, 2024, the market value
of the public warrants, which are quoted for trading on the OTC Pink Market, was 0.0008 per warrant compared with 0.0002 at December
31, 2023. The increase in value, which is recognized as an expense in our income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
was 10,000. 

Liquidity Capital
Resources 

We have incurred net losses
since inception, and experienced negative cash flows from operations. Prior to the business combination, we financed our operations and
capital expenditures primarily through the private sales of equity securities and revenue. The net losses since the business combination
have been financed through the capital received because of the business combination, a public equity offering in May 2023, short-term
cash advances as described below, and the issuance of 8.0 million Term Notes and Convertible Notes in January 2024. Our primary uses
of cash in the short-term are to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business. 

On May 31, 2023, SpringBig
raised gross cash proceeds of approximately 3.0 million through a public equity offering and in addition 1.25 million of the outstanding
principal of the 6 Senior Secured Convertible Note was converted into common shares. In aggregate, 14.0 million common shares were issued,
of which, approximately 1.0 million related to conversion of a portion of the 6 Senior Secured Convertible Note to common shares on June
15, 2023. The cash proceeds from the public equity offering, after payment of transaction related fees, were 2.5 million and these funds
were in part used to make further repayments of principal of the 6 Senior Secured Convertible Note and in part for general corporate
purposes. 

On July 25, 2023, the Company
entered into an agreement (the Cash Advance with Cedar Advance LLC Cedar to sell future receivables to
Cedar in exchange for an advance of 1.0 million. On November 22, 2023, the Company extended the Cash Advance, receiving a further advance
of 0.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, the total outstanding amount payable to Cedar was 1.1 million and 49,000,
respectively, and the outstanding amount was fully repaid during October 2024. 

On October 16, 2023, the
Company entered into an agreement (the ACF Cash Advance with Agile Capital Funding, LLC ACF to sell future
receivables to ACF in exchange for an advance of 750,000. On December 7, 2023, the Company extended the ACF Cash Advance, receiving a
further advance of 0.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, the total outstanding amount payable to ACF was 1.7
million and 0, respectively. 

On January 16, 2024, we entered
into an agreement with the note holder to repurchase the entire outstanding principal of the 6 Senior Secured Notes and cancel the associated
warrants. The outstanding principal and accrued interest was 5.2 million. SpringBig, using a portion of the proceeds from the 8 Convertible
Notes, purchased the entire outstanding obligation to the note holder for 2.9 million. 

On January 23, 2024, the
Company raised 6.4 million through the issuance of 8 Convertible Notes and 1.6 million through the issuance of 12 Term Notes. The
net cash proceeds, after transaction expenses, were 7.2 million. 

The 8 Convertible Notes
accrue interest which is added to the outstanding principal balance semi-annually. The Notes are convertible into common stock at a conversion
price of 0.15 per share at the holder s option any time up to the day prior to maturity, initially in January 2026. The 12 Term
Notes, initially due at issuance in January 2026, accrue interest payable in cash semi-annually. The 8 Convertible Notes and 12 Term
Notes rank pari passu and are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. 

On November 11, 2024, the
Company amended the terms of the 12 Secured Term Notes and 8 Secured Convertible Notes including extending the maturity date to January
23, 2027, amending the interest rates and adjusting the requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance of at least 1
million with the provision now applicable only at the end of any calendar month commencing on or after February 1, 2025. 

The interest rates on the
12 Secured Term Notes and 8 Secured Convertible Notes increase to 17 and 13 , respectively, with effect from the date of amendment,
with the interest rates then reducing by 0.75 for each three-month period that the Company reports an Adjusted EBITDA exceeding 900,000,
starting with the three months ending March 31, 2025, subject to a maximum reduction to 14 and 10 , respectively. In addition, a sum
of 64,000 is payable to the holders of the 12 Secured Term Notes in January 2025, and the principal amount of the 8 Secured Convertible
Notes was increased by 266,000 with effect from the date of the amendment. 

The Company may prepay any
portion of the 12 Secured Term Notes, without penalty, at any time after February 1, 2025.

To the extent existing cash
and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. We may seek to raise additional
funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds by incurring indebtedness, such indebtedness may
have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity
financing may be dilutive to stockholders. Further, the 8 Convertible Notes and 12 Term Notes also contain a number of restrictive covenants
that may impose significant restrictions on obtaining future financings, including restrictions on SpringBig s ability to do any
of each following while the 8 Convertible Notes and 12 Term Notes remain outstanding: (i) incurring additional indebtedness and guaranteeing
indebtedness; (ii) incurring liens or allowing mortgages or other encumbrances; (iii) prepaying, redeeming, or repurchasing certain other
debt; (iv) paying dividends or making other distributions or repurchasing or redeeming its capital stock; (v) selling assets or entering
into or effecting certain other transactions (including a reorganization, consolidation, dissolution or similar transaction or selling,
leasing, licensing, transferring or otherwise disposing of assets of the Company or its subsidiaries); (vi) issuing additional equity
(outside of issuances under our equity compensation plan); and (vii) adopting certain amendments to our governing documents, among other
restrictions. Accordingly, we may be limited in our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all within such limitations.
Such restrictions may be waived by consent of the noteholders. 

Cash Flows 

The following table summarizes
our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):

Operating Activities 

Cash provided by operating
activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock
compensation expenses, changes in the fair value of financial instruments and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. 

In the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the net loss was 0.7 million, and the cash used in operating activities was 1.3 million. The difference of 0.6
million is due to the 1.6 million gain on the repurchase of the 6 Secured Convertible Note in January 2024, the cash benefit of which
is reflected in financing activities, and a 1.0 million increase in working capital (primarily due to reduced payables) being offset
by 2.0 million of non-cash items (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and change in the fair value of warrants). 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net loss was 7.0
million, and cash used in operations was 3.5 million. The cash used by operations benefiting from the receipt of 1.7 million relating
to refundable employee retention payroll tax credits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and 2.4
million of non-cash items offset by a 0.6 million reduction in working capital (primarily due to an increase in receivables). Due to
the complex nature of the employee retention credit computations, we have deferred any benefit related to these credits until we have
reasonable certainty, including, but not limited to, the completion of any potential audit or examination or the expiration of the related
statute of limitations. 

30 

Investing Activities 

SpringBig has low capital
investment requirements, with our needs being comprised primarily of computer equipment and office furniture and related items. Cash used
in investing activities was 64,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 259,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the net cash provided by financing activities was 1.9 million. The proceeds of 7.2 million, net of expenses, from
the issuance of the 1.6 million aggregate principal amount of 12 Secured Term Notes, due 2026, and 6.4 million aggregate principal
amount of 8 Secured Convertible Notes, due 2026, were in part used to repay the 6 Senior Secured Convertible and associated warrants
for cash consideration of 2.9 million. The short-term cash advances were repaid by 1.9 million, and we repaid a related party loan of
 0.5 million. The outstanding balance at September 30, 2024, on the short-term cash advances was 49,000 and this was fully repaid during
October 2024. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, the net cash provided by financing activities was 0.5 million. The sources of financing funds were 2.4 million from
the issuance, net of expenses, of common stock in May 2023, 0.8 million from short-term cash advances, 0.3 million from the exercise
of stock options and 0.1 million from a related party loan. The company repaid 3.1 million of the 6 Senior Secured Convertible Note
during the period. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At September 30, 2024, there
were no off-balance sheet arrangements between us and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,
or capital resources that is material to shareholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the period reported. Certain accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they
are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting
estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different
acceptable assumptions would yield different results. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to
period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We review these estimates
and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary. We believe that
the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, equity-based compensation (including issuance of common stock for services
rendered), and allowance for credit losses have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore,
we consider the policies related to these financial areas to be our critical accounting policies. 

Income Taxes 

We record current income
taxes based on our estimates of current taxable income and provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future income tax payments
and receipts. We are subject to federal income taxes as well as state taxes. In addition, we are subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdictions
where we operate. 

The Company records a deferred
tax asset or liability based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the
anticipated tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary,
by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. The Company adopted ASU 2016-17,
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any
related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will only have one net noncurrent
deferred tax asset or liability. 

The Company has evaluated
its tax positions for any uncertainties based on the technical merits of the positions taken. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld on examination by taxing authorities.
The Company has analyzed the tax positions taken and has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there are no
uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, that would require recognition of a liability or disclosure in the financial statements. 

31 

Stock-Based Compensation 

ASC 718, Compensation
- Stock Compensation, addresses accounting for share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, performance shares and
warrant. Stock-based compensation for stock options to employees and non-employees is based upon the fair value of the award on the date
of grant. We record forfeitures as they occur. The compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally
the vesting period, and is included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The Company estimates the
fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life represents the term the options granted are expected
to be outstanding. The expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of similar publicly traded companies. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. 

Allowance for Credit
Losses 

The Company s reserve
methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses ACL is a critical accounting estimate.
The ACL is maintained at a level believed to be appropriate to provide for the current credit losses expected to be incurred with respect
to accounts receivable balances at the balance sheet date, including balances associated with known or anticipated problem customers. 

Accounts receivables are
charged off to the extent they are deemed to be uncollectible. Net charge-offs are included in historical data utilized for calculating
the ACL. Management maintains a framework of controls over the estimation process for the ACL, including review of historical data and
facts and circumstances related to specific customers, for compliance with GAAP. Management has a quarterly process to review the appropriateness
of historical observation periods and loss assumptions. Management also maintains controls over the information systems, models and spreadsheets
used in the quantitative components of the reserve estimate. This includes the quality and accuracy of historical data used to derive
loss rates, the probability of default, loss given default, and the inputs to industry and macroeconomic forecasts. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-07 (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The ASU primarily will require enhanced disclosures
about significant segment expenses. Additionally, it requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the
CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment s profit or loss in assessing segment performance
and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented
in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements
and disclosures. 

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-09 (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The ASU requires disaggregated information about a
reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as an expansion of other income tax disclosures. The ASU is effective
on a prospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Emerging Growth Company
and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

Section 107 of the JOBS Act
provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company 
can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Section 107 of
the JOBS Act provides that any decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards
is irrevocable. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. 

We are also a smaller
reporting company as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We may continue
to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled
disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as the
market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million measured on the last business
day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year
and the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million measured on the last
business day of our second fiscal quarter.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

We have operations within
the United States and limited operations with customers located in Canada, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of
our business, including the effects of interest rate changes, inflation and exchange rate charges. Information relating to quantitative
and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is set forth below. 

Interest Rate Fluctuation
Risk 

We consider all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

The primary objective of
our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Because our cash and
cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolio s fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes.
In future periods, we will continue to evaluate our investment policy in order to ensure that we continue to meet our overall objectives. 

Inflation 

We do not believe that inflation
has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation
in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. If our costs were to become
subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability
or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Exchange Rate Risk 

We have operations in Toronto,
Canada and customers located in Canada. Given our reporting currency is US dollars, this results in exchange rate translation risk. The
effect is minimized by matching our Canadian income and expense with our Canadian customers being invoiced in their local currency. The
exchange rate risk to our financial statements is immaterial. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures
that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, such
as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC ). Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
appropriately and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Our Chief Executive Officer
(our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer) evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September
30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. See the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for a description of the Company s material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Controls
over Financial Reporting 

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

For a description of developments
to legal proceedings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Litigation under Note 16, Commitments and
Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors
