million in common shares over a three year period ending in June 2025. On September 13, 2024 the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Repurchase Program which increased the authorized aggregate amount of common shares the Company may repurchase to an aggregate of million in common shares. The Company repurchased shares in the open market for a purchase price of approximately million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in remaining aggregate dollar value of shares that may be purchased under the Repurchase Program.

reportable segments: Auction and Liquidation, Refurbishment Resale, and Brokerage. Generally, revenue is recognized at the point in time in which the performance obligation has been satisfied and full consideration is received. The exception to recognition at a point in time occurs when certain contracts provide for advance payments recognized over a period of time. Services revenue recognized over a period of time is not material in comparison to total revenues (less than 1 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023), and therefore not reported on a disaggregated basis. Further, as certain contracts stipulate that the customer make advance payments, amounts not recognized within the reporting period are considered deferred revenue and the Company s contract liability . The deferred revenue balance was approximately million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is reflected in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The deferred revenue balance is primarily related to customer deposits on asset sales within the Refurbishment Resale segment. The Company records receivables in certain situations based on timing of payments for Auction and Liquidation transactions held at the end of the reporting period; however, revenue is generally recognized in the period that the Company satisfies the performance obligation and cash is collected. The Company does not record a contract asset for partially satisfied performance obligations. For auction services and brokerage sale transactions, funds are typically collected from buyers and are held by the Company on the seller's behalf. The funds are included in cash and cash equivalents in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company releases the funds to the seller, less the Company's commission and other fees due, after the buyer has accepted the goods. The amount of cash held on behalf of the sellers is recorded as payables to sellers in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates revenue from Auction and Liquidation and Brokerage segment transactions in accordance with the accounting guidance to determine whether to report such revenue on a gross or net basis. The Company has determined that it acts as an agent for its fee based transactions and therefore reports the revenue from transactions in which the Company acts as an agent on a net basis. The Company also earns income through transactions that involve the Company acting jointly with one or more additional purchasers or lenders, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company LLC agreement (collectively, Joint Ventures ). For these transactions, in which the Company s ownership share meets the criteria for the equity method investments under ASC Topic 323, Equity Method and Joint Ventures , the Company does not record revenue or expense. Instead, the Company s proportionate share of the net income (loss) is reported as earnings of equity method investments. In general, the Joint Ventures apply the same revenue recognition and other accounting policies as the Company.

million or of the amortized cost basis of the total charged-off asset portfolio loans of HGC and its affiliated joint ventures. The Company s share of the Restructured Loans amortized cost basis was million, or of HGC s share of the loan book. All Restructured Loans were restructured by term extension, adding a weighted average of years to the life of the Restructured Loans, which reduced the monthly payments for the borrower. As of September 30, 2023, the Company increased its allowance for credit losses related to its largest borrower experiencing financial difficulties. This resulted in an allowance for credit losses on the loans later restructured of million as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s allowance for credit losses related to the Restructured Loans was million, of which million was classified as notes receivable and million was recorded within equity method investments.

million from the Company s share of other loans within its affiliated joint ventures that are impacted by the default with the largest borrower and were placed in nonaccrual status in June 2024. The Company's share of payments received from the nonaccrual loans, including interest, will be applied against the outstanding loan balance. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of loans in nonaccrual status was million, of which million is recorded within notes receivable and million is recorded within equity method investments. There were loans in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2023. 
 million, recorded in both notes receivable and equity method investments, and consisting of one borrower s note balance of approximately million, or as of September 30, 2024, as compared to as of December 31, 2023. The Company does not intend to hold highly concentrated balances due from one borrower as part of its long-term strategy but may, in the short term, have concentration risk on its path to an established and diversified portfolio. The Company does not evaluate concentration risk solely based on balance due from specific borrowers, but also considers the number of portfolio purchases, type of charged off accounts within the portfolio, and the seller of the portfolio when determining the overall risk. Of the balance due from one borrower of million, there are distinct loan agreements. The underlying portfolio of accounts are diversified throughout FinTech loans, installment loans and credit card accounts, and further diversified amongst six separate sellers of these charged off portfolios. The Company mitigates this concentration risk by requiring, and monitoring, security from each borrower consisting of their charged off and nonperforming receivable portfolios. The Company engages in a due diligence process that leverages its valuation expertise and knowledge in the underlying nonperforming receivable portfolios marketplace. In the event of default, the Company is entitled to call the unpaid interest and principal balances and receive all net collections directly. The Company may also recover its investment by engaging a third party to collect on the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolio or the underlying portfolio can be sold through the Company's Brokerage segment. In certain cases, the Company s recovery options may be subject to concurrence of the originator or other prior holder of the assets.

and the Company's credit loss allowance rate specific to notes receivable was . The increase over the SCALE rate was due to both the above mentioned risks presented by a concentrated balance with a single borrower and declining collections industry-wide. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's allowance for credit losses related to notes receivable outstanding was million and million, respectively. In order to evaluate the need for an adjustment to the receivable balance related to credit losses, or impairment, the Company performs a review of all outstanding loan receivables on a quarterly basis to determine if any indicators exist that suggest the loan will not be fully recoverable and assess the credit quality of the loan receivables. This review includes monthly and cumulative key performance indicators for each loan and borrower, as well as evaluation of borrower's financial condition.

Under the two-class method, earnings for the period are allocated on a pro-rata basis to the common and preferred stockholders. The weighted-average number of common and preferred shares outstanding during the period is then used to calculate basic EPS for each class of shares. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the earnings allocated to the outstanding preferred shares were not material. In periods in which the Company records a net loss, basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As the preferred stock does not participate in losses, the two-class method is not used in periods in which the Company records a net loss. Stock options and other potential common shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share diluted EPS ). In calculating diluted EPS, such shares are assumed to be exercised or converted, except when their effect would be anti-dilutive.

The Company s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and, therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within the same particular economic environment. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. As of January 1, 2019, the Company s incremental borrowing rate was . For leases commencing after January 1, 2019 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at time of commencement. On September 1, 2022, June 1, 2023, and September 23, 2024, the Company s incremental borrowing rate was , , and , respectively. The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases is years and the weighted average discount rate is as of September 30, 2024.

 million. These net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in . The Company s utilization of restricted net operating tax loss carry forwards against future income for tax purposes is restricted pursuant to the change in ownership rules in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. direct or indirect stockholders of a loss corporation have, in aggregate, increased by more than 50 percentage points during the immediately preceding three years. Restrictions in net operating loss carry forwards occurred in 2001 as a result of the acquisition of the Company by Street Capital. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the annual usage of the Company s net operating loss carry forwards was limited to approximately million per annum until 2008 and million per annum through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, all of the Company's restricted net operating loss carry forwards have been fully utilized. The Company has no net operating loss carry forwards limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as of September 30, 2024. The reported tax expense varies from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to the income from operations before taxes primarily as a result of the impact of state income taxes. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes such assets will more likely than not be realized. As a result of cumulative losses and uncertainty with respect to future taxable income, the Company has provided a partial valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. As of both September 30 , 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was approximately million.

 Nonaccrual Loans 
 We determine a loan to be in a default status when the minimum payment amount has not been received within the grace period of the payment due date. The status of default does not solely trigger nonaccrual loan status. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors when evaluating a loan in default status to determine the likelihood of recovering the outstanding principal balance and contractual interest payments. We also monitor our borrowers financial standing and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly updates the collection forecasts for the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolios related to each outstanding loan. If we determine (1) it is not probable that the projected cash flows expected from the borrower s collection efforts on the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolio will be sufficient to satisfy all of the outstanding principal balance and contractual interest payments, and (2) it is not probable that the borrower will be able to meet the minimum required principal and interest payments through other operational cash flows, we will place the loans on nonaccrual status. If, based on our analysis, we elect to maintain accrual status after initial payment default, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due. 
 The accrual of interest is generally discontinued and all accrued interest is reversed against interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest received on such loans is accounted for using the cost-recovery or the cash-basis method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest payments received by the creditor are recorded as interest income provided the amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned at the loan s original effective interest rate. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, there is a sustained period of repayment performance, and all remaining principal and interest payments are deemed probable. 
 23 

In November 2023, we and our affiliated joint ventures restructured loans (the "Restructured Loans") with our largest borrower by restructuring certain outstanding loans with an amortized cost basis of 51.6 million or 59 of the amortized cost basis of the total charged-off asset portfolio loans of our and our affiliated joint ventures. Our share of the Restructured Loans amortized cost basis was 22.2 million, or 57 of our share of the loan book. All Restructured Loans were restructured by term extension, adding a weighted average of 1.5 years to the life of the Restructured Loans, which reduced the monthly payments for the borrower. As of September 30, 2023, we increased the allowance for credit losses related to our largest borrower experiencing financial difficulties. This resulted in an allowance for credit losses on the loans later restructured of 1.0 million as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our allowance for credit losses related to the Restructured Loans was 1.1 million, of which 0.3 million was classified as notes receivable and 0.8 million was recorded within equity method investments. 
 Our largest borrower continues to collect on the underlying charged off and nonperforming consumer loan portfolios and remit net collections to us and senior lenders, however this borrower's June remittance did not meet the minimum required payment amount. We determined that (1) it is not probable that the projected cash flows expected from the borrower s collection efforts on the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolio will be sufficient to satisfy all of the outstanding principal balance and contractual interest payments, and (2) it is not probable that the borrower will be able to meet the minimum required principal and interest payments through other operational cash flows. As we continue to work closely with the borrower and its senior lenders in an effort to mitigate the default in an efficient and effective manner, the impacted loans have been placed in nonaccrual status beginning in June 2024. In addition, there was a balance of 1.5 million from our share of other loans within its affiliated joint ventures that are impacted by the default with our largest borrower and have been placed in nonaccrual status in June 2024. Our share of payments received from this borrower, including interest, will be applied against the outstanding loan balance. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of loans in nonaccrual status was 24.0 million, of which 5.4 million is recorded within notes receivable and 18.6 million is recorded within equity method investments. There were no loans in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2023. 
 Specialty Lending - Concentration and credit risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held a gross balance of investments in notes receivable of 32.0 million, recorded in both notes receivable and equity method investments, and consisting of one borrower s note balance of approximately 22.5 million, or 70 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 62 as of December 31, 2023. We do not intend to hold highly concentrated balances due from one borrower as part of its long-term strategy but may, in the short term, have concentration risk on our path to an established and diversified portfolio. 
 We do not evaluate concentration risk solely based on balance due from specific borrowers, but also consider the number of portfolio purchases, type of charged off accounts within the portfolio, and the seller of the portfolio when determining the overall risk. Of the balance due from one borrower of 22.5 million, there are 11 distinct loan agreements, the underlying portfolio of accounts are diversified throughout FinTech, installment loans and credit card accounts, and further diversified amongst six separate sellers of these charged off portfolios. 
 We mitigate this concentration risk by requiring, and monitoring, security from each borrower consisting of their charged off and nonperforming receivable portfolios. We engage in a due diligence process that leverages our valuation expertise, knowledge and experience in the underlying nonperforming receivable portfolios marketplace. In the event of default, we are entitled to call the unpaid interest and principal balances and receive all net collections directly. We may also recover our investment by engaging a third party to collect on the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolio or the underlying portfolio can be sold through our Brokerage segment. In certain cases, our recovery options may be subject to concurrence of the originator or other prior holder of the assets. From inception of the specialty lending program through September 30, 2024, we have incurred no actual credit losses. 
 Industry and Competition 
 Our business consists primarily of the auction, appraisal, refurbishment and asset advisory services provided by our Industrial Assets division and the charged-off receivable brokerage and specialty financing services provided by our Financial Assets division, each of which is further described below. Our business also includes the purchase and sale, including at auction, of industrial machinery and equipment, real estate, inventories, charged-off receivable and distressed debt. The market for all of these services and assets is highly fragmented. To acquire auction or appraisal contracts, or assets for resale, we compete with other liquidators, auction companies, dealers and brokers. We also compete with them for potential purchasers and lenders. Some competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition. 
 24 

We believe that our business is positioned to grow in all economic cycles. As the economy encounters situations of recession, flattening yield curves and rising credit costs, our business may experience wider margins on principal asset sales, a favorable lending cycle for charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios, higher volumes of nonperforming assets and building surplus inventories and bankruptcies. In times of economic growth, our business has demonstrated its ability to experience growth based on our competitive advantages in the industry, including our domain expertise related to deal sourcing and execution capabilities, our diversification of integrated service platforms and our experience across underserved markets. We intend to continue to leverage our competitive advantages to grow within each segment and across platforms through increasing synergies, maintaining high incremental margins, improving earnings predictability, strengthening financial metrics reflected on our balance sheet and managing expenses. 
 Our business strategy in the Specialty Lending and Auction and Liquidation segments includes the option of partnering with one or more additional purchasers or lenders, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively, Joint Ventures ). These Joint Ventures give us access to more opportunities, help to mitigate some of the competition from the market s larger participants, and contribute to our objective to be the leading resource for clients requiring financial and industrial asset solutions. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe we have attributes that differentiate us from our competitors and that provide us with significant competitive advantages. Our key competitive strengths are described below. 
 Differentiated business model - We believe we have diversified business lines serving the financial and industrial asset liquidation market. We have multiple revenue streams including our brokerage, principal based auction services, refurbishment and resale, advisory services and secured lending services. Further, our business is event-driven and we have repeat, forward-flow contracts in place with industry leading customers. We expect to drive growth in our revenue streams by taking different roles, and using partners as needed. 
 Compelling macro growth drivers - Historically, recessions drive an increased supply of surplus assets and an increased demand for liquidation services, which we believe we are well-positioned to provide. Further, consumer lending and resulting charge-offs are expected to continue their upward trend to meet, and possibly exceed, pre-pandemic levels, which we believe will drive an increased supply of non-performing consumer loans. Additionally, we believe an active market for mergers and acquisitions in manufacturing industries drives demand for industrial asset liquidations and our services. The market in which we operate is highly fragmented, presenting a continued opportunity for the Company to increase market share and drive consolidation. 
 High return on invested capital - We believe we have an opportunity to drive improved auction economics by serving more frequently in the role of principal rather than the lower margin role of broker. Further, we believe we have a strong growth opportunity in providing secured loans to our financial asset debt buyers, a service we are providing through HGC. 
 Strong management team - We have built an experienced executive-level management team with deep domain expertise. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ross Dove, is a third-generation auctioneer and a pioneering innovator in applying technology to the asset liquidation industry. Mr. Dove began his career in the auction business over forty years ago, beginning with a small family-owned auction house and helping to expand it into a global firm, DoveBid, which was sold to a third party in 2008. In addition, our senior management team has deep domain expertise in both industrial asset and financial asset transactions. On September 17, 2020, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Kirk Dove, the former President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Upon his resignation, Kirk Dove continued his employment with us in an advisory capacity, and is expected to do so until December 31, 2024. Also, during 2020, Nick Dove was appointed as President, Industrial Assets Division, and David Ludwig was appointed as President, Financial Assets Division. Nick Dove previously served as Executive Vice President of Sales of Heritage Global Partners since August 2017. David Ludwig previously served as President of NLEX, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and has served in such capacity since the Company acquired NLEX in 2014. 
 Financial Assets Division 
 Our Financial Assets Division provides services to issuers of consumer credit that are looking to monetize nonperforming and charged-off loans loans that creditors have written off as uncollectable. Nonperforming and charged-off loans typically originate from banks that issue unsecured consumer credit. 
 25 

Brokerage Segment 
 Through NLEX, we act as an advisor for sales of charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios via an electronic auction exchange platform for banks and other debt holders throughout the United States and Canada. Since the 1980s, NLEX has sold over 200 billion face value of performing, nonperforming and charged-off assets. NLEX sales are concentrated in online, automotive, credit card, secured and unsecured consumer and business loan and real estate charge-offs. The typical credit we broker sells at a deep discount to face value, and we typically receive a commission for these services from both buyers and sellers. We have existing relationships with high quality, top-tier and mid-tier debt buyers. In addition to its banking relationships, NLEX has continued to be opportunistic as new lending facilities, such as FinTech, peer-to-peer and more recently Buy Now Pay Later lenders have expanded the availability of consumer credit. Together with growing volume in this industry, due to large increases in delinquency and charge-off rates, we anticipate significant growth opportunities in our brokerage segment as these sectors evolve. Given many of our clients' limited resources in this space, we have also implemented post-sale support, further entrenching NLEX with our dedicated clients as well as differentiating us from competitors. 
 Specialty Lending Segment 
 Through HGC, we provide specialty financing solutions to investors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios. Since the inception of HGC in 2019, we have issued 153.9 million in total loans to investors by both self- funded loans and in partnership with senior lenders. Our portion of the total loans funded since inception is 67.5 million. Our income from secured lending consists of upfront fees, interest income, monthly monitoring fees and backend profit share. In general, we expect to earn an annual rate of return on our share of notes receivable outstanding in accrual status of approximately 20 or more based on established terms of the loans funded and performance of collections. Because of the default by our largest borrower discussed above, approximately 75 of the total balance of our loans outstanding were in nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024. We do not expect to realize any return with respect to these loans in 2024, and whether we will realize any return with respect to these loans is uncertain. As of September 30, 2024, our net balance related to investments in loans to buyers of charged-off and nonperforming receivable portfolios was 30.8 million, of which 10.9 million is classified as notes receivable and 19.9 million is classified as equity method investments. 
 Our management team has decades of domain expertise with the ability to leverage extensive funding activity and widespread industry relationships. We believe we have the opportunity for growth through increased penetration of the underserved market of mid-tier buyers of charged-off receivables, providing more economic financing options and a greater variety of funding solutions to our customers.
 
 Industrial Assets Division 
 Our Industrial Assets Division advises enterprise and financial customers on the sale of industrial assets, mostly from surplus and sometimes distressed circumstances while acting as an agent, guarantor or principal in the sale. 
 Auction and Liquidation Segment 
 Through HGP, we offer a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, including the acquisition of turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment. The fees for our services typically range from 15 50 , depending on our role and the transaction. This division predominantly targets sellers of surplus or distressed inside the building assets. Our buyers consist of both end-users and dealers. 
 Refurbishment Resale Segment 
 Through ALT, we have specialized our offering in the biotech and pharma sectors, which have been key verticals over the past decade. ALT focuses on refurbishing and reselling laboratory equipment. 
 Our management team has decades of domain expertise with the ability to leverage extensive industry relationships, real time access to databases of buyers and sales, as well as a deep understanding of the underlying asset value across the more than 25 industrial sectors in which we operate. We believe we have the opportunity for growth in our auction services through our ability to secure ongoing contracts with large multinational sellers, to be a first mover in emerging sectors, and to gain market share in sectors in which we are currently less active. Our extensive network and ability to find and source new opportunities are key factors for expansion. We believe we have the opportunity for growth in our valuation services through the addition of incremental bank-approved vendor lists, geographic expansion and through deeper penetration with our existing bank relationships.

Government Regulation 
 We are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Many jurisdictions also regulate auctions and auctioneers and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business. 
 Legislation in the United States has increased public companies regulatory and compliance costs as well as the scope and cost of work provided by independent registered public accountants and legal advisors. As regulatory and compliance guidelines continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs in the future, which may or may not be material, in order to comply with legislative requirements or rules, pronouncements and guidelines by regulatory bodies. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations references our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Significant estimates include the assessment of collectability of revenue recognized and the valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable, inventory, investments, goodwill and intangible assets, liabilities, deferred income tax assets and liabilities including projecting future years taxable income, and stock-based compensation. These estimates have the potential to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements, either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate, or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring, at a specific point in time, events that are continuous in nature. 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 We have not paid any dividends, and do not expect to pay any dividends in the future. 
 The critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements are discussed in our Form 10-K. There were no material changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

This change was primarily due to an increase in cash of 14.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the current portion of notes receivable by 2.6 million, a decrease in inventory of 0.4 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 1.0 million. Our current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 increased to 20.7 million compared to 14.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The most significant change was an increase in our payables to sellers due to the timing of certain asset liquidation settlements of 8.1 million, partially offset by a decrease of 1.2 million in current portion of third party debt and 0.9 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary source of cash was cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. Cash disbursements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of repayment of third party debt of 6.7 million and investments in notes receivable of 5.0 million. 
 We believe we can fund our operations and our debt service obligations for 12 months from the date of filing this quarterly report and beyond through a combination of working capital, cash flows from our on-going operations and accessing financing from our existing line of credit. 
 Our indebtedness consists of a promissory note dated August 23, 2021 (the ALT Note issued in the amount of 2.0 million as part of the aggregate purchase price paid to acquire certain assets and liabilities of American Laboratory Trading and any amounts borrowed under our 2021 Credit Facility. The terms of the ALT Note require us to pay off the Note in 48 equal installments of approximately 44,000 with an interest rate of 3 per annum and a maturity date of August 23, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of 0.5 million on the ALT Note. 
 27 

On May 26, 2023, we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Reaffirmation of Loan (the Modification Agreement ), by and between the Company and C3 Bank. The Modification Agreement modifies and reaffirms the 2021 Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date, modify the applicable interest rate, and further modify the loan covenants. The maturity date was modified to October 27, 2024. We are permitted to use the proceeds of the loan solely for our business operations. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance on the 2021 Credit Facility. 
 On October 4, 2024 we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Reaffirmation of Loan (the Third Modification Agreement ), effective as of October 4, 2024, to extend the maturity date of the 2021 Credit Facility to December 27, 2024. 
 Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had stockholders equity of 66.1 million and 61.1 million, respectively. 
 We determine our future capital and operating requirements based upon our current and projected operating performance and contractual commitments. We expect to be able to finance our future operations through a combination of working capital, future net cash flows from operating activities and our 2021 Credit Facility. Our contractual requirements are limited to the outstanding debt and lease commitments with related and unrelated parties. Capital requirements are generally limited to our purchases of surplus and distressed assets and our investment activity under our Specialty Lending segment. We believe that our current capital resources, including available borrowing capacity from our 2021 Credit Facility and Term Loan, are sufficient for these requirements. In the event additional capital is needed, we believe we can obtain additional debt financing through capital partners. 
 Cash Position and Cash Flows 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were 26.6 million as compared to 12.3 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of approximately 14.3 million. 
 Cash From Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operations was 13.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.6 million during the same period in 2023. The approximate 0.7 million change was primarily attributable to an increase in operating assets and liabilities of 5.3 million and a decrease of 4.7 million in net income adjusted for noncash items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The changes in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 are primarily due to the nature of our operations. We earn revenue from discrete asset liquidation deals that vary considerably with respect to their magnitude and timing, and that can consist of fees, commissions, asset sale proceeds, or a combination thereof. The operating assets and liabilities associated with these deals are, therefore, subject to the same variability and can be quite different at the end of any given period. 
 Cash From Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 million compared to cash used in investing activities of 14.5 million during the same period in 2023. 
 Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of payments received on notes receivable of 9.0 million and return of investment and cash distributions received from equity method investments of 5.3 million. Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was offset by cash used in investing activities primarily of investments in notes receivable of 5.0 million and equity method investments of 0.3 million. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily in investment in notes receivable of 27.6 million and equity method investments of 6.5 million, related entirely to specialty lending activity within our Financial Assets Division. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was offset by cash provided by investing activities primarily of cash received on transfer of notes receivable to partners of 8.9 million, payments received on notes receivable of 6.1 million as well as return of investment and cash distributions received from equity method investments of 4.8 million. 
 
 Cash From Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was approximately 7.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 4.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 6.3 million in repayments of our Term Loan and 0.4 million in repayments to our ALT Note. Financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of 13.0 million in proceeds from draws on our 2021 Credit Facility and our Term Loan, offset by 7.3 million in repayments to our 2021 Credit Facility, 0.4 million in repayments to our Term Loan and 0.4 million in repayments to our ALT Note. 
 28 

Contractual Obligations 
 Our significant contractual obligations are our third party loans, client and partner asset liquidation settlement payments and lease obligations. The loan and lease obligations are fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K.

Our revenue has several components: (1) traditional fee based asset disposition services, such as commissions from on-line and webcast auctions, liquidations and negotiated sales, and commissions from the NLEX charged-off receivables business, (2) the acquisition and subsequent disposition of distressed and surplus assets, including industrial machinery and equipment and real estate, and (3) fees and interest earned for appraisal, management advisory services and specialty lending services. 
 We report segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. We manage our business primarily on differentiated revenue streams for services offered. Our reportable segments consist of the Auction and Liquidation segment, Refurbishment Resale segment, Brokerage segment, and Specialty Lending segment. Our Auction and Liquidation segment, through HGP, operates as a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, including the acquisition of turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment. Our Refurbishment Resale segment, through ALT, acquires, refurbishes and supplies specialized laboratory equipment. Our Brokerage segment, through NLEX, brokers charged-off receivables in the U.S. and Canada on behalf of financial institutions. Our Specialty Lending segment, through HGC, provides specialty financing solutions to investors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios. 
 29 

We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments based primarily on operating income. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reported segment operating income for ALT and HGC represents incremental costs for managing these segments as part of their sister segments (HGP for ALT and NLEX for HGC). As such, the reported operating income for ALT and HGC does not represent their true standalone contribution, as we do not attempt to allocate existing fixed divisional overhead costs of the sister divisions to the newer segments. Similarly, corporate overhead cost is not allocated to the operating divisions for management reporting purposes. Further, we do not utilize segmented asset information to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and do not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. 
 The following table sets forth operating income for the Company's reportable segments (in thousands):

Costs of services revenue and asset sales were 3.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit of these items was 7.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.7 million during the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 2.5 million, or approximately 26 . The decrease in gross profit in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is primarily due to normal changes in the timing and magnitude of asset liquidation transactions. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense was 5.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.8 million during the same period in 2023.

Selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 1.1 million compared to the selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter of 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in performance-related compensation and an increase to the allowance for credit losses recorded in the third quarter of 2023, which has maintained at a relatively consistent balance through the third quarter of 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense was 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily of amortization expense related to intangible assets in both periods. 
 Earnings of Equity Method Investments - Earnings of equity method investments was 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an immaterial loss during the same period in 2023. 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues and cost of revenues Revenues were 34.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 45.3 million during the same period in 2023. Costs of services revenue and asset sales were 10.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.3 million during the same period in 2023. The gross profit of these items was 23.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 29.0 million during the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately 5.2 million, or approximately 18 . The decrease in gross profit in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is primarily due to a significant one-time principal auction transaction in our Industrial Asset Division in the first quarter of 2023, as well as the normal changes in the timing and magnitude of asset liquidation transactions. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense was 18.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

As compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in performance-related compensation and an increase to the allowance for credit losses recorded in the third quarter of 2023, which has decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense was 0.4 million during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which consisted primarily of amortization expense related to intangible assets. 
 Earnings in Equity Method Investments were 2.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.7 million during the same period in 2023. The 1.9 million increase is mainly due to our 1.3 million share of earnings from the KNFH II LLC joint venture in 2024.

Key Performance Indicators 
 We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures on a regular basis in order to track our underlying operational performance and trends. Other than operating income (a GAAP financial measure as shown in our consolidated statements of income), which we believe is the most important measure of our operational performance and trends, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP financial measures) are key performance indicators KPIs for our business. These KPIs may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. 
 We prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA reflects EBITDA adjusted further to eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation. Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in assessing the Company s results, evaluating the Company s performance and in reaching operating and strategic decisions. Management believes that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, when considered together with our GAAP financial statements and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is useful in providing investors a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the underlying performance of the Company on a historical and ongoing basis. Our use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, any GAAP financial measure. You should carefully evaluate the financial information below, which reconciles our GAAP reported net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 As a Smaller Reporting Company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required t o be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Further, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
