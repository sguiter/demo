 Overview 
 We are an independent technology company seeking to maximize customer value by delivering digital advertising s supply chain of the future. 
 Our technology platform empowers the world s leading digital content creators (which we refer to as publishers across the open internet to maximize monetization of their advertising inventory. Our platform also provides control and transparency to buyers, which includes advertisers, agencies, agency trading desks, and demand side platforms DSPs ), (which we collectively refer to as buyers and enables both publishers and buyers to drive better business outcomes. Our infrastructure-driven approach allows for the efficient processing and utilization of data in real time. By delivering scalable and flexible programmatic innovation, we believe we improve outcomes for our customers while championing a vibrant and transparent digital advertising supply chain. 
 We continue to focus on the strengths that we believe provide us with long-term competitive advantages. These strengths include our global, omnichannel reach which targets a diverse set of publishers touching many ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, over-the-top video/connected TV OTT/CTV ), and rich media. Additionally, as an independent infrastructure provider prioritizing transparency, we can be more closely aligned with both publishers and buyers which has enabled us to build direct relationships with publishers, advertisers, agencies, and DSPs and create bespoke products that meet our customers needs. We have also maintained a demonstrated track record of stability and agility to address these market conditions and provide superior outcomes for both publishers and buyers. Finally, we have designed our technology to efficiently process real-time advertising transactions while leveraging data to optimize outcomes for publishers and buyers. We own and operate our software and hardware infrastructure globally, which saves significant infrastructure expenditures as compared to public cloud alternatives.

 Industry Trends and Macroeconomic Factors 
 The digital advertising ecosystem continues to evolve and adapt at a rapid pace. Some noted trends include the continued growth of digital media across multiple platforms, a continued increase in the number of ad impressions processed and analyzed in real-time by each participant in the digital advertising ecosystem, and a desire for transparency and control throughout the supply chain from both the buyers and publishers. Additionally, rapidly evolving data and privacy regulations and industry standards continue to impact our business. For example, in July 2024, Google announced it will no longer deprecate its use of third-party cookies in Chrome and instead ask users to opt-in or opt-out of cookies in Chrome, which may impact the industry s anticipated shift to alternative identity solutions. 
 Additionally, recent interest rate increases, foreign currency fluctuation and persistent inflation in the U.S. and other markets globally continue to create economic volatility and dislocation in the capital and credit markets in the U.S. and globally. To date, we have not observed material impacts in our business or outlook, but we intend to continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions closely and may determine to take certain financial or operational actions in response to such conditions to the extent our business begins to be adversely impacted. 
 We believe we are positioned to benefit from tailwinds in the advertising industry, including the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for purpose-built infrastructure to address the increasing complexity in the digital advertising landscape, and increasing consumer time spent online. 
 See Risk Factors in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion of the risks related to inflation, rising interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations and public health crises on our business.

 Our Strategy and Performance 
 We believe our growth and financial performance are dependent on many factors, including those described below. 
 Attract New Customers and Expand our Relationship with Existing Customers Globally 
 We leverage our extensive platform capabilities and the subject matter expertise of our team members to grow revenue from our publishers and increase advertising spending from our buyers. Our sales and marketing team includes customer success pods to enhance customer knowledge and implementation of best practices. Once we onboard a new customer, we seek to expand our relationship with existing publishers by establishing multiple header bidding integrations by leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to maximize our access to publishers ad formats and devices, and expanding into the various properties that a publisher may own around the world. We may also up-sell additional products to publisher customers including our header bidding management, identity, and audience solutions. We automate workflow processes whenever feasible to drive predictable and value-added outcomes for our customers and increase productivity of our organization. 
 Net dollar-based retention rate is an important indicator of publisher satisfaction and usage of our platform, as well as potential revenue for future periods. We calculate our net dollar-based retention rate at the end of each quarter for a cumulative twelve months. We calculate our net dollar-based retention rate by starting with the revenue from publishers in the prior trailing twelve-month period Prior Period Revenue ). We then calculate the revenue from these same publishers in the current trailing twelve-month period Current Period Revenue ). Current Period Revenue includes any upsells and is net of contraction or attrition, but excludes revenue from new publishers. 
 Our net dollar-based retention rate equals the Current Period Revenue divided by Prior Period Revenue. Our net dollar-based retention rate was 112 for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 97 for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Our revenue growth in the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of ad impressions processed from our publishers, upselling additional products, penetration of header bidding for mobile app and digital video, and increased demand from the growth of our buyer relationships primarily through SPO agreements. 
 Further, we work with DSPs to help them reduce their costs and improve advertiser ROI, which in turn makes us the specialized cloud infrastructure platform of choice for many of our buying partners. We depend upon a limited number of large DSPs for a large percentage of impressions purchased and our business results, including revenues, may be impacted by changes in their pricing strategies, bidding algorithms or go-to market efforts. As buyers increasingly consolidate their spending with fewer larger technology platforms, we seek to bring an increased proportion of their digital ad spending to our platform through direct deals. S upply Path Optimization SPO continues to be a major growth driver for us as we add new SPO relationships and expand existing ones. We have been investing in SPO technology and partnerships for five years and SPO represented over 50 of total activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Monetization Excellence 
 We focus on monetizing digital impressions by coordinating over a hundred billion real-time auctions and nearly a trillion bids globally on a daily basis, using our specialized cloud software, machine learning algorithms, and scaled transaction infrastructure. Valuable ad impressions are transparent and data rich, viewable by humans, and verifiable. Each ad impression we auction consists of 631 independent data parameters, which can yield valuable insights if recorded and analyzed properly. This processing of voluminous data for each ad impression must occur in less than half a second as consumers expect a seamless digital ad experience. We continually assess impressions from new and existing publishers through a rigorous validation process. We add or remove impressions from our platform based on an assessment of the projected value of the impressions, which is influenced by the type of publisher and its related consumers, as well as the potential volume of monetizable impressions and ad format types, such as digital video. We continuously create and iterate algorithms that leverage vast datasets flowing through our infrastructure to improve the liquidity in our marketplace. Our ability to drive successful outcomes in the real-time auction process on behalf of our publishers and buyers will affect our operating results.

 Infrastructure Platform Efficiency 
 We have a track record of expanding the capacity of our infrastructure platform, while maintaining or reducing the corresponding costs related to processing impressions transacted on our platform on a per impression basis. We expect to continue to invest in both software and hardware infrastructure to continue growing the number of valuable ad impressions we process on our platform. 
 Our recent growth has been driven by a variety of factors including increased access to mobile web (display and video) and mobile app (display and video) impressions and desktop video impressions. Our performance is affected by our ability to maintain and grow our access to valuable ad impressions from current publishers as well as through new relationships with publishers. In September 2024, our platform processed approximately 781 billion ad impressions daily, each in a fraction of a second. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from publishers who use our platform. We generate revenue primarily through fees charged to our publishers, which are generally a percentage of the value of the advertising impressions that publishers monetize on the platform. We also generate revenues from our other products such as OpenWrap, our header bidding solution, and Connect, our solution that provides additional data and insights to buyers, which are sold separate from or in conjunction with use of our platform. In 2023, we launched Activate, which allows buyers to execute direct deals on our platform with publisher inventory, and Convert, our commerce media solution. 
 We report revenue on a net basis. This represents gross billings to buyers, net of amounts we pay publishers. We record our accounts receivable at the amount of gross billings to buyers, net of allowances, for the amounts we are responsible to collect, and we record our accounts payable at the net amount payable to publishers. Accordingly, both accounts receivable and accounts payable appear large in relation to revenue, which is reported on a net basis. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue consists of data center co-location costs, depreciation expense related to hardware supporting our platform, amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs, personnel costs, and allocated facilities costs. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and employee benefit costs, and are primarily attributable to our cloud operations group, which maintains our servers, and our client operations group, which is responsible for the integration of new publishers and buyers and providing customer support for existing customers. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Technology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits costs, allocated facilities costs, and professional services. These expenses include costs incurred in the development, implementation and maintenance of internal-use software, including platform and related infrastructure. We expend technology and development costs as incurred, except to the extent that such costs are associated with internal-use software development that qualifies for capitalization. We expect technology and development expenses to generally increase in absolute dollars in future periods. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits costs, for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer relationship functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to promotional, advertising and marketing activities, allocated facilities costs, travel, and entertainment primarily related to sales activity and professional services. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. 
 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, allocated facilities costs, and travel and entertainment primarily related to inter-office travel and conferences.

Table of Contents 

 Total Other Income (expense), Net 
 Total other income (expense), net consists of interest income and other income (expense), net. Interest income is generated by investing excess cash into money market accounts and marketable securities. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions. 
 We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 
 Provision for (benefit from) Income Taxes 
 The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Our provision for income taxes or income tax benefit may be significantly affected by changes to our estimates for tax in jurisdictions in which we operate and other estimates utilized in determining the global effective tax rate. Actual results may also differ from our estimates based on changes in economic conditions. Such changes could have a substantial impact on the income tax provision. We reevaluate the judgments surrounding our estimates and make adjustments, as appropriate, each reporting period. 
 Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to state taxes, foreign tax rate differences, research tax credits, and stock-based compensation. 
 Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on the generation of future taxable income. In considering the need for a valuation allowance, we consider our historical, as well as future projected, taxable income along with other objectively verifiable evidence. Objectively verifiable evidence includes our realization of tax attributes, assessment of tax credits, and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during the year.

 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 8.1 million, or 13 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 23.3 million, or 13 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our revenues were primarily driven by increased impressions processed on our platform, new revenue streams, and growth in customer relationships. In addition,our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited by approximately 4.2 million and 5.3 million, respectively, from incremental political spend in the United States due to the 2024 presidential election. Our business was negatively impacted by bidding methodology changes implemented by one of our buyers in the second half of the second fiscal quarter. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we served approximately 1,900 publishers and app developers worldwide on our platform, compared to approximately 1,750 publishers and app developers worldwide as of September 30, 2023. For purposes of our publisher count, we aggregate multiple business accounts from separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries into a single master publisher based on our assessment of the related nature of the group. 
 We expect our revenues to be affected by macroeconomic conditions for the remainder of 2024, and will continue to be impacted by the bidding methodology changes implemented by one of our buyers in the near term. The magnitude of these impacts on our future revenues is difficult to predict.

 Cost of revenue decreased 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 1.1 million decrease in data center costs offset by a 0.4 million increase in personnel costs as headcount increased. Overall, our cost of revenue per impression processed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 22 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenue increased 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 0.9 million increase in depreciation of data center equipment and amortization of internal-use software, and a 1.5 million increase in personnel costs, offset by a 1.6 million decrease in data center costs. Overall, our cost of revenue per impression processed for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 19 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our gross margin of 64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to 59 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and our gross margin of 63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to 59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to acceleration of revenue growth. 
 We expect the cost of revenue to be higher in 2024 compared to 2023 in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our capacity to process impressions. Cost of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and period to period, on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue, depending on revenue levels and the volume of transactions we process supporting those revenues, and the timing and amounts of depreciation and amortization of equipment and software.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), including, in particular, operating loss, net cash provided by operating activities, and net income (loss), we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, interest income, and provision for (benefit from) income taxes.

 (2) Amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include a provision for bad debt of million relating to a DSP buyer of our platform that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
 Although Adjusted EBITDA is used by many investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through utilization of cash generated from operations as well as sales of equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 140.4 million and net working capital, consisting of current assets less current liabilities, of 137.0 million. 
 Our principal uses of cash are funding our operations and other working capital requirements. 
 We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and anticipated net cash provided by operating activities, together with available borrowings under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if our operating performance during the next 12 months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our material cash requirements included the contractual commitments set forth under Contractual Obligations and Future Cash Requirements. 
 In February 2023, our board of directors authorized the 2023 Repurchase Program. Subsequently in February 2024, our board of directors authorized the 2024 Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 3,572,563 shares of Class A common stock under the 2023 Repurchase Program and 2024 Repurchase Program, collectively, for an aggregate purchase price of 64.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, 50.9 million remained available for future share repurchases under the 2024 Repurchase Program. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. For purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year, with certain exceptions. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by incurring additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise capital could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. 
 The global advertising industry experiences seasonal trends that affect the vast majority of participants in the digital advertising ecosystem. Most notably, advertisers have historically spent relatively more in the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with the holiday shopping season, and relatively less in the first quarter. We expect seasonality trends to continue, thereby resulting in seasonality in our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and accounts payable balances, and our ability to manage our resources in anticipation of these trends will affect our operating results. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 55,377 52,447 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 9,645 (7,708) Net cash used in financing activities (64,617) (39,391) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 405 5,348

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by growth in our operations, increases or decreases in collections from our buyers and related payments to our publishers, as well as our investment in personnel to support the anticipated growth of our business. Cash flows from operating activities have been affected by changes in our working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable. The timing of cash receipts from buyers and payments to publishers can significantly impact our cash flows from operating activities. For example, we noted an impact to our operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of shifts in spend from one of our large DSPs. In addition, we expect seasonality to impact quarterly cash flows from operating activities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of 55.4 million resulted primarily from adjustments for non-cash expenses of 52.8 million, including 33.9 million for depreciation and amortization and 28.3 million for stock-based compensation, offset by a net loss of 1.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 1.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 1.6 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 4.7 million, and an increase in accounts payable of 8.8 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of 52.4 million resulted primarily from adjustments for non-cash expenses of 48.3 million, including 33.7 million for depreciation and amortization and 21.5 million for stock-based compensation, provision for bad debt of 5.7 million relating to a DSP buyer of our platform that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a decrease in accounts receivable of 8.4 million, offset by a net loss of 9.8 million, and an increase in accrued liabilities of 3.2 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities primarily included investments in marketable securities, purchases of equipment as we expanded the infrastructure in our third-party data centers, and capitalized internal-use software costs in support of enhancing our platform. Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of the expansion of our data centers, the addition of headcount, and the development cycles of our software development. As our business grows, we expect our capital expenditures and our investment activity to continue to increase. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 9.6 million in investing activities, consisting of 13.3 million in purchases of property and equipment (primarily data center infrastructure), and 16.1 million of investments in capitalized internal-use software, and a net decrease in investments of marketable securities of 39.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 7.7 million in investing activities, consisting of 5.4 million in purchases of property and equipment (primarily data center infrastructure), and 13.7 million of investments in capitalized internal-use software, a net increase in investments of marketable securities of 7.4 million, offset by an increase from sales of marketable securities prior to maturity of 18.9 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of 64.6 million was primarily due to purchases of treasury stock of 65.4 million, payment of a business combination indemnification holdback of 2.1 million, offset by proceeds from employee stock option exercises of 1.6 million and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of 1.5 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of 39.4 million was primarily due to purchases of treasury stock. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Future Cash Requirements 
 Our principal contractual obligations consist of non-cancelable leases for our various facilities. In certain cases, the terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments that increase over time. 
 There were no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 5.4 million of long-term income tax liabilities, including interest, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, and adjust those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
 Besides the update to our allowance for credit losses as included within "Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this report, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include: 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 78.9 million and marketable securities of 61.5 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of bank deposits, money market accounts, time deposits, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury and government debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Because our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities have a relatively short maturity, our portfolio s fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. Our line of credit is at variable interest rates. We had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of September 30, 2024. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. In future periods, we will continue to evaluate our investment policy relative to our overall objectives. 
 Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, the majority of our revenue contracts have been denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, primarily the U.S. Dollar, Indian Rupee and British Pound. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative instruments. In the event our foreign sales and expenses increase, our operating results may be more greatly affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can affect our operating income. A hypothetical 10 change in the U.S. Dollar to India Rupee exchange rate could result in a change of 1.6 million in our operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A hypothetical 10 change in the U.S. Dollar to British Pound exchange rate could result in a change of 1.6 million in our operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, for example in India, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designated and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, we cannot state what the eventual outcome of such matters will be. However, based on our knowledge, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors. For additional information, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The Company s business, operations, financial results, and our stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, such developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risks Related to Our Business, Results of Operations and Growth 
 If our existing customers do not expand their usage of our platform, or if we fail to attract new publishers and buyers, our growth will suffer. Moreover, any decrease in the use of the advertising channels that we primarily depend on, or failure to expand into emerging channels, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We depend upon our buyer and publisher relationships, including channel partners, which aggregate large numbers of smaller publishers, to provide advertising space which we can offer to prospective buyers to continue to grow the usage of our platform. In doing so, we compete for both supply and demand with larger, well-established companies that may have technological or other advantages stemming from their broader experience in the market. We must continue to adapt and improve our technology to compete effectively, and customers have not always embraced our offerings due to various factors, including switching costs from moving away from pre-existing technology integrations, such as already implemented header bidding wrappers, and lack of awareness of our omnichannel offerings. Although we believe we provide superior transparency and accountability to such competitors, certain customers may make technological or financial demands that we are unable or unwilling to meet. These and other factors may make it difficult for us to increase our business with our publishers and buyers, cause some buyers to reduce their spending with us, or increase our costs of doing business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 A relatively small number of premium publishers have historically accounted for a significant portion of the ad impressions sold on our platform, as well as a significant portion of our revenue from publishers, including a relatively small number of channel partners. 
 We generally do not have minimum commitments from publishers. As a result, the amount, quality, and cost of ad impressions available to us can change at any time with little or no prior notice, and we cannot assure you that we will have access to a consistent volume or quality of ad impressions at a reasonable cost, or at all. We depend upon a relatively small number of premium publishers and channel partners and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. To support our continued growth, we seek to add additional publishers and buyers to our platform and to expand current utilization with our existing publishers and buyers. Any disruptions in our relationships with premium publishers, buyers, or our largest channel partners could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we cannot retain or add individual publishers with valuable ad impressions, or if such publishers decide not to make their valuable ad impressions available to us, then our buyers may be less inclined to use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 A limited number of large demand side platforms DSPs The Trade Desk and Google DV360 in particular account for a significant portion of the ad impressions purchased on our platform. We depend upon these DSPs for a large percentage of impressions purchased and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. We have no minimum commitments from buyers to spend on our platform, so the amount of demand available to us and our ability to generate revenue from that demand can change at any time with little or no prior notice, and we cannot assure you that we will have access to a consistent volume or quality of ad campaigns or demand for our ad impressions at a reasonable or consistent price, or at all. A change in the pricing strategies, bidding algorithms or go-to-market efforts by one of these large DSPs could disproportionately impact our business results, including revenues. For example, bidding methodology changes implemented by one of our buyers in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 impacted our revenue for the quarter. Any disruptions in our relationships with DSPs, agencies, advertisers, or buyers could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If a buyer or group of buyers representing a significant portion of the demand in our marketplace decides to materially reduce use of our platform or the manner in which they use our platform, it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and profitability and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Historically, our buyers have predominantly used our platform to purchase mobile, display, and video advertising inventory from our publishers. We expect that these will continue to be significant channels used by our customers for digital advertising in the future. We also believe that our revenue growth may depend on our ability to expand within mobile, video, and in particular, CTV, and we are continuing to enhance such channels. We may not be able to accurately predict changes in overall advertiser demand for the channels in which we operate and cannot assure you that our investment in formats will correspond to any such changes or shifts in demand. Any decrease in the use of mobile, display, and video advertising, whether due to customers losing confidence in the value or effectiveness of such channels, regulatory restrictions or other causes, or any inability to further penetrate CTV or enter new and emerging advertising channels, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not meet our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors. 
 We operate in an evolving industry with ever-changing customer needs and behavior, and, as a result, our business has evolved over time such that our operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and future results of operations are likely to fluctuate as well. Although we have experienced prolonged revenue growth, we may not be able to sustain this growth rate, current revenue levels, or profitability. In addition, because our business is evolving, our historical results of operations may be of limited utility in assessing our future prospects. We expect to face challenges, risks, and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing industries, including those relating to: 
 changes in demand and pricing for ad impressions sold on our platform; 
 changes in our access to valuable ad impressions from publishers; 
 responding to evolving industry standards and government regulations that impact our business, particularly in the areas of data protection and consumer privacy; 
 developing, maintaining, and expanding relationships with publishers, DSPs, agencies, advertisers, and buyers; 
 seasonality in our business; 
 innovating and developing new solutions that are adopted by and meet the needs of publishers, DSPs, agencies, advertisers, and buyers; 
 competing against companies with a larger customer base or greater financial or technical resources; 
 changes in the structure of the buying and selling of ad impressions; 
 changes in the pricing policies of publishers and competitors; 
 changes in the bidding behavior of buyers of ad impressions; 
 changes in demand due to changes in macroeconomic environment, including as a result of an economic downturn, recession, inflation, changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates, disruptions to supply chains, or otherwise; 
 further expanding our business internationally; and 
 recruiting, integrating, and retaining qualified and motivated employees, particularly engineers. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 Any one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. You should not rely on our past results as an indicator of our future performance. 
 Risk Related to Data Collection and the Use of Collected Data 
 The disabling of third-party cookies, and the potential of others to develop proprietary replacements for cookies, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Some prominent technology companies have also announced intentions to discontinue the use of third-party cookies, and to develop alternative methods and mechanisms for targeting advertisements. For example, in January 2024, Google disabled third-party cookies for up to 1 of Chrome users and also initially announced plans to disable cookies for additional users beginning in the third quarter of 2024. However, in July 2024, Google announced it will no longer depreciate its use of third-party cookies in Chrome and instead ask users to opt-in or opt-out of cookies in Chrome. If companies are forced to rely on targeting methodologies other than cookies, such companies may instead rely on proprietary products, algorithms, or statistical methods to track consumers without cookies, or may utilize log-in credentials entered by consumers into other web properties owned by those companies such as their email services to track web usage, including usage across multiple devices. 
 Additionally, such companies may build different and potentially proprietary consumer tracking methods into their widely used web browsers, which we may not be able to effectively use for our publishers and buyers. Many applications and other devices also allow consumers to avoid receiving advertisements by paying for subscriptions or other downloads. Although we believe our platform is well-positioned to adapt and continue to provide key data insights to our publishers without cookies, this transition could be more disruptive, slower, or more expensive than we currently anticipate, or publishers and buyers could elect to move a larger proportion of their advertising inventory or spend to these providers to take advantage of proprietary consumer tracking methods, any of which could materially affect our ability to serve our customers, publishers, and buyers, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
