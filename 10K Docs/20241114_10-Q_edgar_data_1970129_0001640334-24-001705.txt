As used in this quarterly report, the terms we , us , our and our company mean Legend Spices, Inc., a Nevada company, unless otherwise indicated. General Overview We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on May 10, 2021. Our fiscal year end is December 31. Our business offices are currently located at 14 Kajaznuni Street, Apt. 70 Yerevan 0070, Armenia. Our telephone number is +374 (99) 432000 and our email is info@legendspices.com. The address of agent for service in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o National Registered Agents, Inc. of Nevada, 100 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, NV, 89701. Our Current Business We are engaged in the production and marketing of seasonings to enhance the flavor of food, especially the foods of the Caucasus, a unique cuisine consisting primarily of grilled skewered meats and fresh vegetables. Our business is to create unique seasonings made from spices, herbs and salt sourced from Armenia into a family of products called Legend Spices. Currently our market is only Armenia. The Caucasus is a mountainous region lying between the Black Sea (west) and the Caspian Sea (east) and occupied by Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Lodged between Asia and Europe, the Caucasus is truly in the confluence of East and West. It stands at the crossroads of the two continents and thus is a compelling blend of European and Asian cultures and heritage, packed full of stunning natural landscapes that can rival any of the top world tourist destinations. The shared landscape combined with its location on ancient trading routes has endowed this region with a unique natural diversity and cultural history. By virtue of its physical attributes, the Southern Caucasus possesses a unique character that is well suited to the fast growing and increasingly diversified sustainable tourism market. The region is a perfect candidate for the new adventure tourism trends. 1 This region is also relatively safe, cheap and easy to reach (from both Europe and Asia), and yet, it s still pretty much off the beaten path. 11 Table of Contents Travel specialists say it won t be long before the major regions of the Caucasus transition from under-the-radar places to travel to major tourism destinations. As Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan become more popular among tourists, so will their culinary offerings a melange of dishes influenced by Greek, Persian, and Mediterranean cuisine. 2 Although each republic possesses its own characteristics, they share numerous traditions especially related to food. Caucasian cuisine is still relatively unknown to those living in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The cuisines are similar to each other with some regional variations. We see this region as an ascending tourist destination and consider it an opportunity to recreate these same flavors at home creating an entirely new segment in the spices and seasonings category. There is also a large number of Caucasian (especially Armenian) ex-pats living in North America and Europe who wish to acquire a taste of home away from home. In North America, there are about 2 million Armenians, 18 000 Georgians, and 14 000 Azerbaijanis. In Europe, this number is 1 million for Armenians, 15 000 for Georgians and 10 000 for Azerbaijanis. There are also many North Americans and Europeans with Caucasian heritage who have never been to their motherland and wish to connect with their roots. We hope this large group will be eager to create the cuisine of their heritage in their own kitchens. Homesick ex-pats eager to recreate the flavors of their homeland is another potential market. These highlighted groups will be our initial target market for Legend Spices products. Since these Caucasus cultures and cuisines are so interconnected, we hope our spices will appeal to all ex-pats from this region including Armenians, Georgians and Azeris living in North America and Europe. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds to execute our business plan expansion to North America and Europe and we anticipate requiring 100,000 to be able to execute the business plan. Results of Operations For the periods of nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. The following table summarizes our operating results for the nine-month and three-month periods ending September 30, 2023 and ended September 30, 2024: Three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited) Three-month period ended September 30, 2023 (unaudited) Nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited) Nine -month period ended September 30, 2023 (unaudited) Revenue 1,566 1,663 4,552 4,289 Cost of Sales 958 1,108 3,016 3,800 Expenses 6,970 14,386 25,758 28,241 Net Loss (6,362 (13,831 (24,222 (27,752 Revenue and Cost of Sales During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 4,552 (106.13 comparing to previous year) with cost of sales of 3,016, resulting in gross margin of 1,536, 33.74 of nine-monthly revenues and 314.18 comparing to previous year. We generated revenues primarily from the sale of our seasoning products. The cost of sales primarily consisted of the ingredients 55 and packaging 45 . There are minimal revenues and management cannot offer any assurance that we will continue to generate revenues as our revenues are affected by factors such as the success of our marketing efforts, the size of our customer base, consumer s preferences and general economic conditions. 12 Table of Contents Expenses During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses of 25,758, primarily consisting of general and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of legal and accounting fees, rent and website construction. Initially, a significant portion of our expenses were attributed to one-time legal fees for the preparation of contracts and fees related to assisting a market maker with the filing of the 15c-211 with FINRA for the public offering of the shares of our common stock. Management anticipates expenses to rise over the foreseeable future as marketing expenses increase as a result of our efforts to increase our revenues. Since we only recently commenced business operations, management does not believe past performance is indicative of future performance. For the periods of three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. Revenue and Cost of Sales During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 1,566 (94.18 comparing to previous year) with cost of sales of 958, resulting in gross margin of 608, 38.84 of three-monthly revenues and 109.61 comparing to previous year. We generated revenues primarily from the sale of our seasoning products. The cost of sales primarily consisted of the ingredients 55 and packaging 45 . There are minimal revenues and management cannot offer any assurance that we will continue to generate revenues as our revenues are affected by factors such as the success of our marketing efforts, the size of our customer base, consumer s preferences and general economic conditions. Expenses During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses of 6,970 respectively, primarily consisting of general and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of legal and accounting fees, rent and website construction. Initially, a significant portion of our expenses were attributed to one-time legal fees for the preparation of contracts and fees related to the assisting a market maker with the filing of the 15c-211 with FINRA for the public offering of the shares of our common stock. Management anticipates expenses to rise over the foreseeable future as marketing expenses increase as a result of our efforts to increase our revenues. Since we only recently commenced business operations, management does not believe past performance is indicative of future performance. Liquidity and Capital Resources As at September 30, 2024 (unaudited) As at December 31, 2023 (audited) Current assets 4,233 4,946 Current liabilities 5,179 5,162 Working capital (deficit) (946 (216 As at September 30, 2024, we had cash of 219 and working deficit of 946. We have incurred operating losses since inception, and this is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. We require funds to enable us to address our minimum current and ongoing expenses. Presently, our revenue is not sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses. Management projects that we may require an additional 100,000 to fund our operating expenditures for the next twelve-month period, as follows: 13 Table of Contents Legal and accounting 30,000 Salaries 15,000 Contract marketing services 10,000 Raw material purchases 10,000 Travel expenses for overseas promotion 10,000 FDA approval of all products 10,000 Advertising/Promotion 15,000 100,000 We anticipate that our cash on hand and the revenue that we anticipate generating going forward from our operations will not be sufficient to satisfy all of our cash requirements for the next twelve-month period. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to obtain additional financing, particularly, if the volatile conditions in the stock and financial markets persist. We plan to raise capital through an offering and loans from our director, provided that such funding continues to be available to our company. We plan to continue to seek additional funds from our director to fund our day-to-day operations until any offering is fully subscribed. We have no guarantee that our director will continue to fund our day-to-day operations. The issuance of additional equity securities may be required by our company in the future and may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds if required for our continued operations or that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain additional financing as required on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet certain obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. Because we are in the development stage and are yet to attain profitable operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have not yet achieved profitable operations, have accumulated losses since our inception and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Product Research and Development We anticipate that we will spend 5,000 on research and development over the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025. Purchase of Significant Equipment We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment over the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2024. Contingencies and Commitments We had no contingencies or long-term contractual obligations as at December 31, 2023, or as at the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. Cashflows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 we did not have any investing activities. 14 Table of Contents Cashflows from Financing Activities For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash used by Operating activities 23,289 and net cash provided by financing activities 24,919. Initial Start-up costs of 31,142 was provided by the CEO and President. We have no current commitment from our Officer and Director or any other financier to supplement our operations or provide us with financing in the future. If we are unable to raise capital from an offering, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. Even if we are able to continue our operations, the failure to obtain financing could have a substantial adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the future, we may be required to seek additional capital by selling debt or equity securities, selling assets, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then shareholders. We provide no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We estimate the need for approximately 100,000 funding during the next 12 months to commence our business operations as planned. We hope to raise this amount from an offering. If we are unable to raise this amount, we will be restricted in the implementation of our business plan. Expenditures The following chart provides an overview of our budgeted expenditures for the 12 months. The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. Legal and accounting 30,000 Salaries 15,000 Contract marketing services 10,000 Raw material purchases 10,000 Travel expenses for overseas promotion 10,000 FDA approval of all products 10,000 Advertising/Promotion 15,000 100,000 We had cash on hand of 219 as of September 30, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 15 Table of Contents Management has conducted, with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 in accordance with the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on present company activity. In the course of making our assessment, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness consisted of inadequate staffing and supervision within the bookkeeping and accounting operations of our company. The relatively small number of staffs who have bookkeeping and accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our financial reporting. This quarterly report does not include an attestation report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only the management s report in this quarterly report. C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 16 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we area party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on us, except for the following: Item 1A. Risk Factors As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 2.
