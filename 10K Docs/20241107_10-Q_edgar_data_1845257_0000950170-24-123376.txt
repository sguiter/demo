Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, and other future conditions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate, believe, envision, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, target, potential, will, would, could, should, continue, contemplate and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. For example, all statements we make relating to: our ability to grow our business, expand access to our patients and our payors and invest in our platform; our plan to partner with additional hospital systems, large primary care groups and other specialist groups; our expectation that we will continue to open de novo center and acquire new centers; our growth rates and financial results; our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives and strategies; and our expected market opportunity are forward-looking statements. 
 We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, factors and assumptions described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 28, 2024, including, among other things: 
 if reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or deliver care to patients, our business could be harmed; 

we may not grow at the rates we historically have achieved or at all, even if our key metrics may imply future growth, including if we are unable to successfully execute on our growth initiatives and business strategies; 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively, our expenses could increase more than expected, our revenue may not increase proportionally or at all, and we may be unable to execute on our business strategy; 

our ability to recruit new clinicians and retain existing clinicians; 

we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; 

we are dependent on our relationships with supported practices, which we do not own, to provide healthcare services, and our business would be harmed if those relationships were disrupted or if our arrangements with these entities became subject to legal challenges; 

we operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and financial performance would be harmed; 

the impact of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but may harm our business; 

if our or our vendors security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to our employees , patients or partners data is obtained, our systems may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, including through private litigation or regulatory action, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose patients and partners; 

our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems; 

our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our business and growth prospects; and 

the other factors set forth under Risk Factors. 

The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

of the non-medical assets, however due to legal requirements the physician-owners must retain 100 of the equity interest. The Company s agreements with FPEs generally consist of both a Management Service Agreement, which provides for various administrative and management services to be provided by the Company to the FPE, and Stock Transfer Restriction STR agreements with the physician-owners of the FPEs, which provide for the transition of ownership interests of the FPEs under certain conditions. The outstanding voting equity instruments of the FPEs are owned by the nominee shareholders appointed by the Company under the terms of the STR agreements. The Company has the right to receive income as an ongoing management fee, which effectively absorbs all of the residual interests and has also provided financial support through loans to the FPEs. The Company has exclusive responsibility for the provision of all nonmedical services including facilities, technology and intellectual property required for the day-to-day operation and management of each of the FPEs, and makes recommendations to the FPEs in establishing the guidelines for the employment and compensation of the physicians and other employees of the FPEs. In addition, the STR agreements provide that the Company has the right to designate an appropriately licensed person(s) to purchase the equity interest of the FPE for a nominal amount in the event of a succession event at the Company s discretion.

Total consideration transferred 

The results of the acquired businesses have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements beginning as of their acquisition dates. It is impracticable to provide historical supplemental pro forma financial information along with revenue and earnings subsequent to the acquisition dates for acquisitions during the period due to a variety of factors, including access to historical information and the operations of acquirees being integrated within the Company shortly after closing and not operating as discrete entities within the Company s organizational structure.

Fair value of net assets 

The majority of the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as of the respective dates of acquisition, as their carrying values approximated their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions were estimated primarily based on the income approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on the present value of the cash flows that the assets are expected to generate in the future. The Company developed estimates for the expected future cash flows and discount rates used in the present value calculations.

Contingent Consideration Under the provisions of the acquisition agreements, the Company may pay additional cash consideration in the form of earnouts, contingent upon the acquirees achieving certain performance and operational targets (see Note 8). 

Goodwill Goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce, customer and payor relationships and anticipated synergies and economies of scale expected from the integration of the businesses. The synergies include certain cost savings, operating efficiencies, and other strategic benefits projected to be achieved as a result of the acquisition. All goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

 Discount rate 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration liability due to remeasurement at the reporting date. Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments, including an interest rate swap, for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company entered into a hedge transaction (interest rate swap) using a derivative financial instrument for the purpose of hedging the Company s exposure to interest rate risks, which the contractual terms of the hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. The objective of entering into the interest rate swap is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") interest payments associated with the variable-rate loan over the life of the loan. In August 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of on a total notional value of of debt. As a result of the interest rate swap, of the term loan previously exposed to interest rate risk from changes in SOFR is now hedged against the interest rate swap at a fixed rate. The interest rate swap matures on September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the notional value was . As changes in interest rates impact the future cash flow of interest payments, the hedge provides a synthetic offset to interest rate movements. The Company used the income approach to value the derivative for the interest rate swap using observable market data for all significant inputs and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount, assuming that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact. This derivative instrument (interest rate swap) is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, with the entire gain or loss on the derivative reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are released to earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction impacts consolidated earnings within interest expense, net. The cash flows from the derivative treated as a cash flow hedge is classified in the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows in the same category as the item being hedged. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company included immaterial gains on the hedged instrument (variable-rate borrowings) in the same line item (interest expense, net) as the offsetting gain on the related interest rate swap in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under Risk Factors Part II, Item 1A in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as those discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our," "our business," "LifeStance" and "our Company" and similar references refer to LifeStance Health Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and supported practices. References to "our employees" and "our clinicians" refer collectively to employees and clinicians, respectively, of our subsidiaries and supported practices. References to "our patients" refer to the patients treated by such clinicians. 
 Our Business 
 We are reimagining mental health through a tech-enabled care delivery model built to expand access, address affordability, improve outcomes and lower overall healthcare costs. We are one of the nation s largest outpatient mental health platforms based on the number of clinicians we employ through our subsidiaries and our supported practices and our geographic scale, employing 7,269 licensed mental health clinicians as of September 30, 2024. Our patient-focused platform combines a personalized, digitally-powered patient experience with differentiated clinical capabilities and in-network insurance relationships to fundamentally transform patient access and treatment. By revolutionizing the way mental healthcare is delivered, we believe we have an opportunity to improve the lives and health of millions of individuals. 
 Our model is built to empower each of the healthcare ecosystem s key stakeholders patients, clinicians, payors and primary care and specialist physicians by aligning around our shared goal of delivering better outcomes for patients and providing high-quality mental healthcare. 
 Patients - We are the front-door to comprehensive outpatient mental healthcare. Our clinicians offer patients a full spectrum of outpatient services to treat mental health conditions. Our in-network payor relationships improve patient access by allowing patients to access care without significant out-of-pocket cost or delays in receiving treatment. Our personalized, data-driven comprehensive care meets patients where they are, through convenient virtual and in-person settings. We support our patients throughout their care continuum with purpose-built technological capabilities, including online assessments, digital provider communication, and seamless internal referral and follow-up capabilities. 

Clinicians - We empower clinicians to focus on patient care and relationships by providing what we believe is a superior workplace environment, as well as clinical and technology capabilities to deliver high-quality care. We offer a unique employment model for clinicians in a collaborative clinical environment, employing our clinicians through our subsidiaries and supported practices. Our integrated platform and national infrastructure reduce administrative burdens for clinicians while increasing engagement and satisfaction. 

Payors - We partner with payors to deliver access to high-quality outpatient mental healthcare to their members at scale. Through our extensive scale, we offer payors a pathway to reduce overall cost of care in the broader healthcare system while supporting improved physical and mental health outcomes. 

Primary care and specialist physicians - We collaborate with primary care and specialist physicians to enhance patient care. Primary care is an important setting for the treatment of mental health conditions primary care physicians are often the sole contact of patients with a mental illness and, in many instances where patients have a chronic condition, specialist physicians step into the role of primary physicians. We partner with primary care physicians and specialist physician groups across the country to provide a mental healthcare network for referrals and, in certain instances, through virtual and physical co-location to improve the diagnosis and treatment of their patients. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Results 
 Expanding Center Capacity and Visits Within Existing Centers 
 We have built a powerful organic growth engine that enables us to drive growth within our existing footprint. 
 18 

Our Clinicians 
 As of September 30, 2024, we employed 7,269 psychiatrists, advanced practice nurses, psychologists and therapists through our subsidiaries and supported practices. We generate revenue on a per visit basis (total revenue per visit ("TRPV")) as clinical services are rendered by our clinicians. We generate lower revenue and experience lower clinician productivity in periods that have fewer business days than other periods. We measure productivity by the number of visits that are performed by a clinician, which is driven by the time clinicians make available to see patients and our ability to fill clinician's schedules by attracting new patients, scheduling patients, and converting scheduled appointments to completed visits. Clinician productivity impacts our ability to generate revenue and also impacts clinician compensation, as clinician compensation is primarily driven by the number of visits provided by each clinician. Recruiting new clinicians and retaining existing clinicians enables us to see more patients by expanding our patient visit capacity. 
 We believe our dedicated employment model offers a superior value proposition compared to independent practice. Our network relationships provide clinicians with ready access to patients. We also enable clinicians to manage their own patient volumes. Our platform promotes a clinically-driven professional culture and streamlines patient access and care delivery, while optimizing practice administration processes through technology. We believe we are an employer of choice in mental health, allowing us to employ highly qualified clinicians. 
 We believe we have significant opportunity to grow our employed clinician base from our current base of 7,269 clinicians employed through our subsidiaries and supported practices, as of September 30, 2024. We have developed a rigorous and exclusive in-house national clinician recruiting model that works closely with our regional clinical teams to select the best candidates and expand capacity in a timely manner. As we grow our clinician base, we can grow our business, expand access for our patients and our payors and invest in our platform to further reinforce our differentiated offering to clinicians. We have available physical capacity to add clinicians to our existing centers, as well as an opportunity to add new clinicians with the targeted roll-out of de novo centers. Our virtual care offering also allows clinicians to see more patients without investments in incremental physical space, expanding our patient visit capacity beyond in-person only levels. 
 Our Patients 
 We believe our ability to attract and retain patients to drive growth in our visits and meet the availability of our clinician base will enable us to grow our revenue. We believe we have a significant opportunity to increase the number of patients we serve in our existing markets. Our clinicians treated patients through 2.0 million and 5.9 million visits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We believe our ability to deliver more accessible, flexible, affordable and effective mental healthcare is a key driver of our patient growth. We believe we provide a superior and differentiated mental healthcare experience that integrates virtual and in-person care to deliver care in a convenient way for our patients, meeting our patients where they are. Our in-network payor relationships allow our patients to access affordable care without significant out-of-pocket cost or delays in receiving treatment. We treat mental health conditions across the outpatient spectrum through a clinical approach that focuses on improved patient outcomes. We support our patients throughout their care continuum with purpose-built technological capabilities, including online assessments, digital provider communication, and seamless internal referral and follow-up capabilities. 
 We utilize multiple strategies to add new patients to our platform, including our primary care and specialist physician relationships, internal referrals from our clinicians, our payor relationships and our dedicated marketing efforts. We have established a large network of national, regional and local payors that enables their members to be referred to us as patients. Payors refer patients to our platform to drive improvement in health outcomes for their members, reduction in total medical costs and increased member satisfaction and retention. Within our markets, we partner with primary care practice groups, specialists, health systems and academic institutions to refer patients to our centers and clinicians. Our local referral marketing teams build and maintain relationships with our referring partner networks to create awareness of our platform and services, including the opening of new centers and the introduction of newly hired clinicians with appointment availability. We also use online marketing to develop our national brand to increase brand awareness and promote additional channels of patient recruitment. 
 Our Primary Care and Specialist Physician Referral Relationships 
 We have built a powerful patient referral network through partnerships with primary care physicians and specialist physician groups across the country. We deliver value to our provider partners by offering a more efficient referral pathways, delivering improved outcomes for our shared patients, and enabling more integrated care and lower total healthcare costs. As we continue to scale nationally, we plan to partner with additional hospital systems, large primary care groups and other specialist groups to help streamline their mental health network needs and drive continued patient growth across our platform. Our vision over time is to further integrate our mental healthcare services with those of our medical provider partners. By co-locating and driving toward integration with primary care and specialty providers, we can enhance our clinicians' access to patients. We anticipate that we will continue to grow these relationships while evolving our offering toward a fully-integrated care model in which primary care and our mental health clinicians work together to develop and provide personalized treatment plans for shared patients. We believe these efforts will help to further align our model with that of other healthcare providers, increasing our value to them and driving new opportunities to partner to grow our patient base and revenue opportunities. 
 19 

Our Payors 
 Our payor relationships, including national contracts with multiple payors, allow access to our services through in-network coverage for their members. We believe the alignment of our model with our payor partners population health objectives encourages third-party payors to partner with us. We believe we deliver value to our payor partners in several ways, including access to a national clinician employee base, lower total medical costs, and stronger member and client value proposition through the offering of in-network mental health services. The strength of our payor relationships and our value proposition has historically allowed us to secure rate parity between in-person and virtual visits, either by contract or payor policy. To expand this network and grow access to covered patients, we continue to evaluate new payor relationships and national contracts where we believe the payor's policies and approach to mental healthcare align with our mission, while also seeking to drive regional rate improvement, including terminating certain of our lower-volume payor contracts to support continued investment in our differentiated model for delivering mental healthcare. We believe our payor relationships differentiate us from our competitors and are a critical factor in our ability to expand our market footprint in new regions by leveraging our existing national payor relationships. As we continue to grow, we believe our scale, breadth and access will continue to be enhanced, further strengthening the value of our platform to payors. 
 As part of our ongoing business operations, we renegotiate our existing payor contracts and enter into new payor contracts. Our results of operations can fluctuate based on the reimbursement rates resulting from these payor contract negotiations and renegotiations. To the extent that payors, particularly payors comprising a significant portion of our revenue, negotiate lower reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 Expand and Optimize our Center Base Within Existing and New Markets 
 We believe we have built a powerful market growth engine that allows us to rapidly grow our presence within our markets and unlock potential latent demand through our differentiated scale, access and affordability. 
 De Novo Centers 
 Our de novo center strategy is a central component of our organic growth engine to build our capacity and increase density in our existing metropolitan statistical areas. We believe there is a significant opportunity to use de novo center openings to address potential patient need in our existing markets and new markets that we have determined are attractive to enter. We systematically locate our centers within a given market to ensure convenient coverage for in-person access to care. We believe our successful de novo program and national clinician recruiting team can support additions of new centers and clinicians. 
 We continue to utilize a more sustainable design for all new de novo centers that reimagines the mental healthcare experience for both patients and clinicians while reinforcing our commitment to sustainability. 
 Acquisitions 
 We believe the highly fragmented nature of the mental health market provides us with a meaningful opportunity to selectively pursue acquisitions that meet our standards of high-quality clinical care and align with our mission. We believe our guiding principle of creating a national platform built with a patient and clinician focus makes us a partner of choice for smaller, independent practices. Our acquisition strategy has been deployed both to enter new markets and in our existing markets. In new markets, acquisitions have allowed us to establish a presence with high-quality practices with a track record of clinical excellence and in-network payor relationships that can be integrated into our national platform. In existing markets, acquisitions have allowed us to grow our geographic reach and clinician base to expand patient access. 
 Real Estate Optimization 
 In connection with our expansion through de novo builds and acquisitions, in 2023, we announced a strategic re-focus, to prioritize resources and close certain centers as a direct result of changes to our business model driven by a shift to more virtual visits initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we completed a significant reduction in physical space and exited several underoccupied offices by both negotiating terminations of and abandoning certain real estate leases during 2023. We plan to continue to optimize our real estate footprint on a go-forward basis as part of our recurring operations. 
 Center Margin 
 As we grow our platform, we seek to generate consistent returns on our investments. See Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Center Margin for our definition of Center Margin and reconciliation to income (loss) from operations. We believe this metric best reflects the economics of our model as it includes all direct expenses associated with our patients care. We seek to grow our Center Margin through a combination of (i) growing revenue through clinician hiring and retention, patient growth and engagement, hybrid virtual and in-person care, existing office expansion, and in-network reimbursement levels, and (ii) leveraging on our fixed cost base at each center. For acquired centers, we also seek to realize operational, technology and reimbursement synergies to drive Center Margin growth. 
 20 

Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We evaluate the growth of our footprint through a variety of metrics and indicators. The following table sets forth a summary of the key financial metrics we review to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our business plan and make strategic decisions:

Center Margin and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and are not intended to be substitutes for any GAAP financial measures, including revenue, income (loss) from operations or net loss, and, as calculated, may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. Therefore, non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Center Margin 
 We define Center Margin as income (loss) from operations excluding depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses. Therefore, Center Margin is computed by removing from income (loss) from operations the costs that do not directly relate to the delivery of care and only including center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization. We consider Center Margin to be an important measure to monitor our performance relative to the direct costs of delivering care. We believe Center Margin is useful to investors to measure whether we are sufficiently controlling the direct costs of delivering care. 
 Center Margin is not a financial measure of, nor does it imply, profitability. The relationship of income (loss) from operations to center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization is not necessarily indicative of future profitability from operations. Center Margin excludes certain expenses, such as general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization, which are considered normal, recurring operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of our centers. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of our Company as a whole, and Center Margin should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. Other companies that present Center Margin may calculate it differently and, therefore, similarly titled measures presented by other companies may not be directly comparable to ours. In addition, Center Margin has limitations as an analytical tool, including that it does not reflect depreciation and amortization or other overhead allocations. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of income (loss) from operations, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, to Center Margin:

Adjusted EBITDA 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP performance measure, to supplement our results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance, and may be helpful to securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in understanding our operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to companies in other industries or within the same industry with similarly titled measures of performance. Therefore, our Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income or loss. 
 21 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax provision (benefit), gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of assets, transaction costs, executive transition costs, litigation costs, strategic initiatives, real estate optimization and restructuring charges, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, and other expenses. We include Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report because it is an important measure upon which our management assesses, and believes investors should assess, our operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. 
 However, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, including: 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash used for capital expenditures for such replacements or for new capital expenditures; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not include the dilution that results from equity-based compensation or any cash outflows included in equity-based compensation, including from our repurchases of shares of outstanding common stock; and 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments. 

A reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net loss.

(1) Primarily includes capital markets advisory, consulting, accounting and legal expenses related to our acquisitions and to the secondary offering completed in the second quarter of 2024. 

(2) Litigation costs include only those costs which are considered non-recurring and outside of the ordinary course of business based on the following considerations, which we assess regularly: (i) the frequency of similar cases that have been brought to date, or are expected to be brought within two years, (ii) the complexity of the case (e.g., complex class action litigation), (iii) the nature of the remedy(ies) sought, including the size of any monetary damages sought, (iv) the counterparty involved, and (v) our overall litigation strategy. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, litigation costs included cash expenses related to three distinct litigation matters, including (x) a securities class action litigation, (y) a privacy class action litigation and (z) a compensation model class action litigation. For a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, please read Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this report. 

(3) Strategic initiatives consist of expenses directly related to a multi-phase system upgrade in connection with our recent and significant expansion. During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we continued a process of evaluating and adopting critical enterprise-wide systems for (i) human resources management, (ii) clinician credentialing and onboarding process, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, (iii) a scalable electronic health resources system. Strategic initiatives represents costs, such as third-party consulting costs and one-time 

22 

costs, that are not part of our ongoing operations related to these enterprise-wide systems. We considered the frequency and scale of this multi-part enterprise upgrade when determining that the expenses were not normal, recurring operating expenses. 

(4) Real estate optimization and restructuring charges consist of cash expenses and non-cash charges related to our real estate optimization initiative, which include certain asset impairment and disposal costs, certain gains and losses related to early lease terminations, and exit and disposal costs related to our real estate optimization initiative to consolidate our physical footprint during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As the decision to close these centers was part of a significant strategic project driven by a historic shift in behavior, the magnitude of center closures has been and is expected to be greater than what would be expected as part of ordinary business operations and do not constitute normal recurring operating activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, real estate optimization and restructuring charges consisted of certain gains and losses related to early lease terminations of previously abandoned real estate leases in 2023. 

(5) Represents amortization of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud-based software arrangements that are included within general and administrative expenses included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

(6) Primarily includes costs incurred to consummate or integrate acquired centers, certain of which are wholly-owned and certain of which are supported practices, in addition to the compensation paid to former owners of acquired centers and related expenses that are not reflective of the ongoing operating expenses of our centers. Acquired center integration and other are components of general and administrative expenses included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Former owner fees is a component of center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization included in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are summarized for each period in the table below:

Total Revenue 
 Total revenue increased 49.8 million, or 19 , to 312.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 262.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to an increase of 48.6 million of patient service revenue and an increase of 1.2 million of nonpatient revenue. The increase in patient service revenue was mainly due to a net increase of 851 in total clinicians from organic hiring, resulting in an increase in patient visits of 0.3 million, or 15 . Additionally, TRPV increased year-over-year primarily driven by modest payor rate increases. 
 Total revenue increased 150.4 million, or 19 , to 925.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 775.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to an increase of 149.2 million of patient service revenue and an increase of 1.2 million of nonpatient revenue. The increase in patient service revenue was mainly due to a net increase of 851 in total clinicians from organic hiring, resulting in an increase in patient visits of 0.8 million, or 15 . Additionally, TRPV increased year-over-year primarily driven by modest payor rate increases. 
 We anticipate revenue growth to continue to be driven by our in-house clinician recruiting and de novo strategies as well as our ability to increase patient visits at existing centers through our ability to accommodate virtual sessions in addition to our in-person visits. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization 
 Center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased 25.6 million, or 14 , to 212.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 186.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to a 24.0 million increase in center-based compensation due to the increase in patient visits of 0.3 million from the increase in the total number of clinicians from organic hiring. In addition, occupancy costs consisting of center rent and utilities and other center operating expenses consisting of office supplies and insurance contributed to the increase of 1.6 million. 
 Center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization increased 76.2 million, or 14 , to 632.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 556.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to a 73.2 million increase in center-based compensation due to the increase in patient visits of 0.8 million from the increase in the total number of clinicians from organic hiring. In addition, occupancy costs consisting of center rent and utilities and other center operating expenses consisting of office supplies and insurance contributed to the increase of 3.0 million. 
 We expect our center costs, excluding depreciation and amortization to continue to increase in the short- to medium-term as we strategically invest to expand our business through our in-house clinician recruiting and de novo strategies and to potentially capture more of our market opportunity.

General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 45.6 million, or 35 , to 85.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 130.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease of 41.6 million in other operating expenses as a result of professional fees and legal expenses preceding the settlement of our shareholder class action lawsuit during the third quarter of 2023 with no similar expense in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, there was a decrease of 6.6 million in stock-based compensation, which was slightly offset by an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits of 3.8 million. Further, the decrease is also partially attributable to a decrease of 0.7 million in third-party consulting costs and one-time costs associated with our strategic initiatives related to the multi-phase system upgrade in connection with our recent and significant expansion and a decrease of 0.5 million in occupancy costs. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 48.0 million, or 15 , to 269.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 317.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease of 43.1 million as a result of professional fees and legal expenses preceding the settlement of our shareholder class action lawsuit during the third quarter of 2023 with no similar expense in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, there was a decrease of 18.4 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily relating to the RSUs granted at the time of our IPO without a similar expense in 2024, which was offset by an increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits of 18.8 million. Further, there was a decrease in third-party consulting costs and one-time costs associated with our strategic initiatives of 2.0 million related to the multi-phase system upgrade in connection with our recent and significant expansion and a decrease of 3.3 million in occupancy costs. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to our planned investments to support company growth. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 4.5 million to 15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles and depreciation during the periods. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 1.9 million to 56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 58.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles and depreciation during the periods. 
 Other Expense 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 0.1 million to 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on borrowings outstanding during the period. 
 Interest expense, net increased 1.4 million to 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher borrowings outstanding during the period. 
 Income Tax (Provision) Benefit 
 Income tax (provision) benefit decreased 17.0 million to a provision of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a benefit of 16.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to taxable loss and non-deductible equity awards for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income tax (provision) benefit decreased 28.6 million to a provision of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a benefit of 27.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to taxable loss and non-deductible equity awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, including to execute on our de novo strategy, contractual obligations, debt service, acquisitions, settlement of contingent considerations obligations, and other commitments with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Our principal sources of liquidity to date have included cash from operating activities, cash on hand and amounts available under that certain credit agreement entered into on May 4, 2022, as amended, by the Company, LifeStance Health Holdings, Inc., Lynnwood Intermediate Holdings, Inc., Capital One, National Association, and each lender party thereto (the "2022 Credit Agreement"). We had cash and cash equivalents of 102.6 million and 78.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of our September 30, 2024 unaudited financial statements, without any additional financing. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary because of, and our future capital requirements 
 25 

will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to acquire new centers and expand into new markets and the expansion of marketing activities. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 Our future obligations primarily consist of our debt and lease obligations. We expect our cash generation from operations and future ability to refinance or secure additional financing facilities to be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt obligations and lease payment obligations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was an aggregate principal amount of 287.3 million and 289.5 million outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our non-cancellable future minimum operating lease payments totaled 243.8 million. 
 Debt 
 On May 4, 2022, LifeStance Health Holdings, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, entered into the 2022 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Credit Agreement establishes commitments in respect of a senior secured term loan facility of 200.0 million (the Term Loan Facility ), a senior secured revolving loan facility of up to 50.0 million (the Revolving Facility and a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility of up to 100.0 million (the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility ). 
 The loans under the Term Loan Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) adjusted term SOFR (which adjusted term SOFR is subject to a minimum of 0.75 plus an applicable margin of 3.75 or (y) an alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) 0.50 above the federal funds effective rate and (iii) one-month adjusted term SOFR (which adjusted term SOFR is subject to a minimum of 0.75 plus 1.00 plus an applicable margin of 2.75 . The loans under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 3.25 or (y) an alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) 0.50 above the federal funds effective rate and (iii) one-month adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00 plus an applicable margin of 2.25 . 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement also contains a maximum first lien net leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant that requires the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter to not exceed 8.50:1.00. First Lien Net Leverage Ratio means the ratio of (a) Consolidated First Lien Secured Debt outstanding as of the last day of the test period, minus the Unrestricted Cash Amount on such last day, to (b) Consolidated EBITDA for such test period, in each case on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement.

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided 44.9 million of cash, primarily impacted by our 50.3 million net loss and 146.0 million in non-cash charges. This was partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 50.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 33.7 million of cash, primarily impacted by our 141.3 million net loss and 169.2 million in non-cash charges. This was partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 61.6 million. 
 Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used 15.3 million of cash resulting from our purchases of property and equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, investing activities used 48.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from our business acquisitions of 19.8 million and purchases of property and equipment of 29.1 million. 
 26 

Cash Flows (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities used 5.9 million of cash, resulting primarily from payments of loan obligations of 2.2 million and payments of contingent consideration of 3.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financing activities provided 16.6 million of cash, resulting primarily from borrowings of 25.0 million under the 2022 Credit Agreement, partially offset by payments of loan obligations of 1.8 million, payments of debt issue costs of 0.2 million and payments of contingent consideration of 6.4 million. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report include the results of LifeStance Health Group, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs consolidated by LifeStance Health Group, Inc. in which LifeStance Health Group, Inc. has an interest and is the primary beneficiary for the period ended September 30, 2024. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of total revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical when (1) the estimate made in accordance with GAAP is complex in nature or involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. For a description of our policies regarding our critical accounting estimates, see Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates or methodologies to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation or interest rates. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure is changing prime rate-based interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of 287.3 million outstanding under our credit facilities. In the current economic environment, we manage interest expense using a combination of variable-rate debt and a fixed-interest-rate swap. In August 2022, we entered into a hedge transaction (interest rate swap) using a derivative financial instrument for the purpose of hedging our exposure to interest rate risks, which the contractual terms of the hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. The objective of entering into the interest rate swap is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate interest payments associated with variable-rate loan over the life of the loan under our credit facilities. 
 We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Based on our analysis of the periods presented, we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operating results. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses described below. 
 27 

Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which continue to exist as of September 30, 2024. The material weaknesses we identified were as follows: 
 We did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements due to an insufficient complement of resources in the accounting/finance and IT functions, with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training. This material weakness contributed to the following additional material weaknesses: 
 We did not maintain formal accounting policies and procedures, and did not design and maintain effective controls related to significant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over account reconciliations, segregation of duties and the preparation and review of journal entries. 

These material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements related to the identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations that impacted the classification of intangible assets and goodwill, related impacts to amortization and income tax expense, and the restatement of our previously issued annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 with respect to such intangibles assets acquired in business combinations. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of substantially all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls for financial systems to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate Company personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch jobs are monitored and data backups are authorized and monitored; and (iv) testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. 

These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements; however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness. 
 Actions Taken During the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 The following remediation efforts were completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024: 
 We have added a Manager of Stock Administration to our human resources function to oversee our equity awards and stock-based compensation; 

We have designed and implemented new stock administration controls and enhanced existing stock administration controls to specifically address the accuracy and completeness of awards granted to certain employees or other service providers; 

We have enhanced controls related to cash management to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures; and 

We have designed and implemented new controls for related party transactions and enhanced controls related to related party transactions to achieve complete, accurate and timely identification of related party transactions, reporting and disclosures. 

As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are continuing to enhance our overall control environment and are devoting substantial effort by enhancing our manual or automated controls to remediate the identified material weakness. For a more comprehensive discussion of the remedial measures which are being undertaken to address these material weaknesses, or the Remediation Plan, refer to Part II, Item 9A, Remediation of Material Weaknesses, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 28 

Status of Remediation Efforts 
 We believe the measures described above will remediate the control deficiencies for the specific areas we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify, or in appropriate circumstances not complete, certain of the remediation measures described above. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 We intend to evaluate current and projected resource needs on a regular basis and hire additional qualified resources as needed. Our ability to maintain qualified and adequate resources to support our business and our projected growth will be a critical component of our internal control environment. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We are taking actions to remediate the material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. Other than the changes to our internal control over financial reporting described in "Actions Taken During the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024" above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or Affiliated Practice or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliated Practice since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.07 , then such financial ratio or test (or Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets) shall be calculated to give pro forma effect thereto in accordance with this Section 1.07 ; provided that with respect to any pro forma calculations to be made in connection with any acquisition or investment in respect of which financial statements for the relevant target are not available for the same Test Period for which internal financial statements of the Borrower are available, the Borrower shall determine such pro forma calculations on the basis of the available financial statements (even if for differing periods) or such other basis as determined on a commercially reasonable basis by the Borrower. 
 (3)	Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a Financial Officer of the Borrower and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of run rate cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies projected by the Borrower in good faith to result from, or relating to, any Specified Transaction (including the Transactions and, for the avoidance of doubt, acquisitions and investments occurring prior to the Effective Date) which is being given pro forma effect that have been realized or are expected to be realized and for which the actions necessary to realize such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies are taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (in the good faith determination of the Borrower) (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies had been realized in full on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies were realized in full during the entirety of such period and run rate means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the elimination of a public target s compliance costs with public company requirements), whether prior to or following the Effective Date, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions, and any such adjustments shall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests and during any subsequent Test Period in which the effects thereof are expected to be realized) relating to such Specified Transaction; provided that (a) such amounts are reasonably identifiable, (b) such actions are taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (in the good faith determination of the Borrower) no later than eighteen (18) months after the date of such Specified Transaction (or actions undertaken or implemented prior to the consummation of such Specified Transaction), (c) no amounts shall be added to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA (or any other components thereof), whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period and (d) any run rate cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to this Section 1.07(3), when aggregated with amounts added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to clauses (1)(l), (1)(s) and (1)(t) of the definition thereof, together with amounts excluded pursuant to clause (1)(b) of Consolidated Net Income, in any Test Period, in each case, other than amounts added back in connection with the Transactions, shall not in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to 35.0 of Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower (calculated after giving effect to any 
 118 

such addback and all other permitted add-backs and adjustments) for such Test Period on a pro forma basis. 
 (4)	In the event that (a) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantees), issues or repays (including by redemption, repurchase, repayment, retirement, discharge, defeasance or extinguishment) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility or line of credit unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and not replaced, (b) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Stock, (c) any Restricted Subsidiary issues, repurchases or redeems Preferred Stock or (d) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary establishes or eliminates any Designated Revolving Commitments, in each case included in the calculations of any financial ratio or test (and, in each case of the foregoing clauses (a) and (d), any Lien incurred in connection therewith), (i) during the applicable Test Period or (ii) subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made, then such financial ratio or test shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, issuance, repayment or redemption of Indebtedness, issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, or establishment or elimination of any Designated Revolving Commitments, in each case to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period and, in the case of Indebtedness for all purposes as if such Indebtedness in the full amount of any undrawn Designated Revolving Commitments had been incurred thereunder throughout such period. 
 (5)	Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Financial Officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate. 
 (6)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.07 or in any classification under GAAP of any Person, business, assets or operations in respect of which a definitive agreement for the disposition thereof has been entered into, at the election of the Borrower, no pro forma effect shall be given to any discontinued operations (and the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to any such Person, business, assets or operations shall not be excluded for any purposes hereunder) until such disposition shall have been consummated. 
 (7)	Any determination of Total Assets shall be made by reference to the last day of the Test Period most recently ended for which internal financial statements of the Borrower are available and have been delivered to the Administrative Agent (as determined in good faith by the Borrower) on or prior to the relevant date of determination. 
 (8)	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary, in the event any Lien, Indebtedness (including any Incremental Loans, Incremental Commitments, Permitted Incremental Equivalent Debt, Other Loans or Other Commitments), Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment, or other transaction, action, judgment or amount incurred under any provision in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (or any of the foregoing in concurrent transactions, a single transaction or a series of related transactions) meets the criteria of one or more than one of the categories of Baskets under this Agreement (including within any defined terms), including any Fixed Basket or Non-Fixed Basket, as applicable, the Borrower shall be permitted, in its sole discretion, to divide and classify and to later, at any time and from time to time, re-divide and re-classify (including to re-classify utilization of any Fixed Basket as being incurred 
 119 

under any Non-Fixed Basket or other Fixed Basket or utilization of any Non-Fixed Basket as being incurred under any Fixed Basket or other Non-Fixed Basket) on one or more occasions (based on circumstances existing on the date of any such re-division and re-classification) any such Lien, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment, or other transaction, action, judgment or amount, in whole or in part, among one or more than one applicable Baskets under this Agreement within the same covenant (other than with respect to re-classification of Restricted Payments to Indebtedness pursuant to the Restricted Payment Capacity Debt Basket) (in the case of re-classification or re-division, so long as the amount so re-classified or re-divided is permitted at the time of such re-classification or re-division to be incurred pursuant to the applicable Basket into which such amount is re-classified or re-divided at such time). For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Lien, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment or other transaction, action, judgment or amount that shall be allocated to each such Basket shall be determined by the Borrower at the time of such division, classification, re-division or re-classification, as applicable. If any Lien, Indebtedness (including any Incremental Loans, Incremental Commitments, Permitted Incremental Equivalent Debt, Other Loans or Other Commitments), Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment, or other transaction, action, judgment or amount incurred under any provision in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (or any portion of the foregoing) previously divided and classified (or re-divided and re-classified) as set forth above under any Fixed Basket, could subsequently be re-divided and re-classified under a Non-Fixed Basket, such re-division and re-classification shall be deemed to occur automatically, in each case, unless otherwise elected by the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Indebtedness incurred under this Agreement (including on the Closing Date) will, at all times, be classified as being incurred under Section 7.02(2)(a) and may not be re-classified. For all purposes hereunder, (x) Fixed Basket shall mean any Basket that is subject to a fixed-dollar limit (including Baskets based on a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets) and (y) Non-Fixed Basket shall mean any Basket that is subject to compliance with a financial ratio or test (including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio) (any such ratio or test, a Financial Incurrence Test ). 
 (9)	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary, in calculating any Non-Fixed Basket (a) any Indebtedness concurrently incurred to fund original issue discount or upfront fees and (b) any amounts incurred, or transactions entered into or consummated, in reliance on a Fixed Basket (including the Free and Clear Incremental Amount) in a concurrent transaction, a single transaction or a series of related transactions with the amount incurred, or transaction entered into or consummated, under an applicable Non-Fixed Basket, in each case of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), shall be disregarded in the calculation of such Non-Fixed Basket; provided that full pro forma effect shall be given to all applicable and related transactions (including the use of proceeds of all applicable Indebtedness incurred and any repayments, repurchases and redemptions of Indebtedness) and all other adjustments as to which pro forma effect may be given under this Section 1.07 (this clause (9), the Stacking Provision ). 
 (10)	If any Lien, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment, or other transaction, action, judgment or amount (any of the foregoing in concurrent transactions, a single transaction or a series of related transactions) is incurred, issued, taken or consummated in reliance on categories of Baskets measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, and any Lien, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment, or other transaction, action, judgment or amount (including in connection with refinancing thereof) would subsequently exceed the applicable percentage of Consolidated EBITDA if calculated based on the Consolidated EBITDA on a later date (including the date of any refinancing or re-classification), such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA will be deemed not to be exceeded (so long as, in the case of refinancing any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (and any related Lien), the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such newly incurred or issued Indebtedness, 
 120 

Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the maximum principal amount, liquidation preference or amount of Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, extended, replaced, refunded, renewed or defeased). 
 (11)	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary, when (a) calculating any applicable Financial Incurrence Test, or availability under any Basket, in connection with the incurrence of any Limited Condition Transaction, any Indebtedness or any other transaction in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including for all purposes under this clause (11) , the making of acquisitions and investments, Asset Sales or other dispositions, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments of Indebtedness, the making of Restricted Payments and/or the designation of a Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary), (b) determining (i) compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no Default or Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default) has occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom, (ii) compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires compliance with any representations and warranties set forth or referenced herein or (iii) the satisfaction of any other conditions, in each case under this clause (b) , in connection with the incurrence of any Limited Condition Transaction, any Indebtedness or any other transaction in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto, in each case under the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) , the date of determination of such Financial Incurrence Test, availability under any Basket or other provisions, determination of whether any Default or Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default) has occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom, determination of compliance with any representations or warranties or the satisfaction of any other conditions shall, at the option of the Borrower (in its sole discretion) (the Borrower s election to exercise such option, an LCT Election , which LCT Election may be in respect of one or more of clauses (a) , b)(i) , (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) above), be deemed to be (I) any of the date the definitive agreements (or other relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition Transaction, Indebtedness or other transaction in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction or action or transaction related thereto, as applicable, are entered into (including, at the Borrower s option, any amendment entered into in connection therewith) (or, (A) in the case of any redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of Indebtedness, the date on which notice with respect to such Limited Condition Transactions is sent, (B) in the case of any Restricted Payment, the date of declaration thereof and (C) in the case of any other action or transaction, any similar event) (provided that, solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, at the option of the Borrower, the LCT Test Date shall be deemed to be the date on which a Rule 2.7 announcement of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in another jurisdiction) is made or delivered in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction) or (II) the time of funding of any of the applicable Indebtedness or consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or other transaction in connection therewith or action or transaction related thereto provided that, notwithstanding the LCT Election made under the foregoing clauses (I) and (II) , the Borrower may elect (in its sole discretion) to re-determine one or more of clauses (a) , b)(i) , (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) above at the time of funding of any of the applicable Indebtedness or consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or other transaction in connection therewith or action or transaction related thereto (and/or, if earlier, at the option of the Borrower, any delivery of financial statements prior to the funding or consummation) (such date in clause (I) or (II), the LCT Test Date and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 1.07(11) , if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction, any Indebtedness or other transaction in connection therewith and any actions or transactions related thereto and any related pro forma adjustments, the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such Basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such Basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided , that (x) if financial statements for one or more 
 121 

subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine availability under Baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such Basket and (y) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (x) , compliance with such Baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction, any Indebtedness or other transaction incurred in connection therewith and any actions or transactions related thereto. 
 (12)	For the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has made an LCT Election, (a) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such Financial Incurrence Test or Basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or total assets of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will be deemed not to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations, (b) other than as expressly set forth in clause (11) , if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any (or any type of) continuing Default or Event of Default and satisfaction of any representations and warranties) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of any Default or Event of Default or failure to satisfy any representations and warranties), such requirements and conditions will be deemed not to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing and such representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been satisfied) and (c) in calculating the availability under any Financial Incurrence Test or Basket in connection with any action or transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice or declaration for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such Financial Incurrence Test or Basket shall be determined or tested (x) giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto and (y) solely with respect to Restricted Payments (other than Restricted Investments), without giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in clause (11) directly above and this clause (12), no Event of Default under Section 8.01(1) or 8.01(6) shall be continuing at the time any Limited Condition Transaction is consummated. 
 (13)	For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any financial ratio or financial test (including Section 7.10 hereof, any First Lien Net Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Net Leverage Ratio test and/or any Total Net Leverage Ratio test) and/or the amount of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income, such financial ratio, financial test or amount shall, subject to this Section 1.07 , be calculated at the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio, financial test or amount occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be. 
 Section 1.08	 Available Amount Transaction. If more than one action occurs on any given date the permissibility of the taking of which is determined hereunder by reference to the amount specified in clause (b) of Section 7.05(1) immediately prior to the taking of such action, the permissibility of the taking of each such action shall be determined independently and in no event may any two or more 
 122 

such actions be treated as occurring simultaneously, i.e., each transaction must be permitted under clause (b) of Section 7.05(1) as so calculated. 
 Section 1.09	 Guaranties of Hedging Obligations. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in any Loan Document, no non-Qualified ECP Guarantor shall be required to guarantee or provide security for Excluded Swap Obligations, and any reference in any Loan Document with respect to such non-Qualified ECP Guarantor guaranteeing or providing security for the Obligations shall be deemed to be all Obligations other than the Excluded Swap Obligations. 
 Section 1.10	 Currency Generally. 
 (1)	The Borrower shall determine in good faith the Dollar equivalent amount of any utilization or other measurement denominated in a currency other than Dollars for purposes of compliance with any Basket. For purposes of determining compliance with any Basket under Article VII or VIII with respect to any amount expressed in a currency other than Dollars, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of currency exchange occurring after the time such Basket utilization occurs or other Basket measurement is made (so long as such Basket utilization or other measurement, at the time incurred, made or acquired, was permitted hereunder). Except with respect to any ratio calculated under any Basket, any subsequent change in rates of currency exchange with respect to any prior utilization or other measurement of a Basket previously made in reliance on such Basket (as the same may have been reallocated in accordance with this Agreement) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining any unutilized portion under such Basket. 
 (2)	For purposes of determining the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Total Net Leverage Ratio, the amount of Indebtedness and cash and Cash Equivalents shall reflect the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of Hedging Obligations permitted hereunder for currency exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination of the Dollar equivalent of such Indebtedness. 
 Section 1.11	 Letters of Credit. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit in effect at such time (not to exceed the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time after giving effect to any automatic reductions or increases, as applicable, to such stated amount pursuant to the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit after the occurrence of any applicable condition (including the expiration of any applicable period); provided , however , that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any L/C Application related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the stated amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time). 
 
 Section 1.12	 Term Benchmark Replacement. 
 (1)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents: 
 (a)	Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted notice of such proposed amendment to 
 123 

all Lenders and the Borrower, so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from the Required Lenders stating that such Benchmark Replacement does not constitute a replacement index rate that is widely adopted in the leveraged syndicated loan market (and any such objections shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error). No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 1.12(1) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 
 (b)	In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time in consultation with the Borrower and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. 
 (c)	The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (i) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 1.12(d) and (ii) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower as expressly set forth in this Section 1.12(1) and the defined terms used herein, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 1.12(1). 
 (d)	 Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (e)	 Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrowers may revoke any request for a SOFR Loan of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate. 
 124 

Section 1.13	 Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.

 (f)	wire instructions of the account(s) to which funds are to be disbursed. 
 If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan to be made in a Committed Loan Notice, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Term Benchmark Rate Loans with an Interest Period of one (1) month. If the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the 
 126 

applicable Loans shall be made or continued as the same Type of Loan, which if a Term Benchmark Rate Loan, shall have a one-month Interest Period. Any such automatic continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term Benchmark Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have an identical Interest Period as the Interest Period just ending. 
 (2)	Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Applicable Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Applicable Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans or continuation of Loans described in Section 2.02(1) . In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Applicable Agent in Same Day Funds at the Applicable Agent s Office not later than, in the case of Borrowing on the Closing Date, 10:00 a.m., New York time, and otherwise 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV for any Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Applicable Agent either by (a) crediting the account(s) of the Borrower on the books of the Applicable Agent with the amount of such funds or (b) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided by the Borrower to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent; provided that if on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Borrowing under a Revolving Facility is given by the Borrower (other than with respect to the Closing Date Revolving Borrowing), there are Swing Line Loans or L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowing and second, to the payment in full of any such Swing Line Loans, and third, to the Borrower as provided above. 
 (3)	Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term Benchmark Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term Benchmark Rate Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.05 in connection therewith. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Applicable Agent at the direction of the Required Facility Lenders under the applicable Facility may require by notice to the Borrower that no Loans under such Facility may be converted to or continued as Term Benchmark Rate Loans. 
 (4)	The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term Benchmark Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Term Benchmark Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time when Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
 (5)	After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent; provided that after the establishment of any new Class of Loans pursuant to an Incremental Amendment, a Refinancing Amendment, an Extension Amendment or an amendment in respect of Replacement Loans, the number of Interest Periods otherwise permitted by this Section 2.02(5) shall increase by three (3) Interest Periods for each applicable Class so established. 
 127 

(6)	The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 
 (7)	Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:30 p.m., New York time, on the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share and such other applicable share available to the Applicable Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (2) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Applicable Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Applicable Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Applicable Agent at (a) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (b) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Applicable Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A certificate of the Applicable Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(7) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If the Borrower and such Lender shall both pay all or any portion of the principal amount in respect of such Borrowing or interest to the Applicable Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Applicable Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such Borrowing or interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Applicable Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Applicable Agent. 
 Section 2.03	 Letters of Credit. 
 (1)	 The Letter of Credit Commitments . 
 (a)	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each Issuing Bank agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03 , (A) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the L/C Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for the account of Holdings (to the extent not prohibited under Section 7.09 ), the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (so long as the Borrower is a co-applicant and jointly and severally liable thereunder) provided that any such Letter of Credit may be for the benefit of Holdings or any Subsidiary of the Borrower) and to amend or extend such Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(2) , and (B) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit and (ii) the Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this Section 2.03 ; provided that no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the date of such L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender would exceed such Lender s Revolving Commitment, (y) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Sublimit or (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations issued by such Issuing Bank would exceed its L/C Commitment. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and 
 128 

accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. 
 (b)	An Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: 
 (i)	any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or direct that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder); 
 (ii)	subject to Section 2.03(2)(c) , the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless (A) each Appropriate Lender has approved of such expiration date or (B) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized or back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank prior to the date that is twelve months after the date of issuance thereof; 
 (iii)	subject to Section 2.03(2)(c) , the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the L/C Expiration Date, unless (I) each Appropriate Lender has approved of such expiration date or (II) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized or back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank prior to the L/C Expiration Date; 
 (iv)	the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally; provided that no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue either (A) letters of guarantee or bankers acceptances or (B) commercial letters of credit, in each case without its consent; or 
 (v)	any Revolving Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Bank s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(1)(d) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. 
 An Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (i) such Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof or (ii) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. 
 129 

(2)	 Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit . 
 (a)	Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the applicable Issuing Bank in the form of a L/C Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such L/C Application must be received by the relevant Issuing Bank not later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be, or, in each case, such later date and time as the relevant Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank: 
 (i)	the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); 
 (ii)	the amount thereof; 
 (iii)	the expiry date thereof; 
 (iv)	the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; 
 (v)	the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; 
 (vi)	the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and 
 (vii)	such other matters as the relevant Issuing Bank may reasonably request. 
 In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such L/C Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank: 
 (i)	the Letter of Credit to be amended; 
 (ii)	the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); 
 (iii)	the nature of the proposed amendment; and 
 (iv)	such other matters as the relevant Issuing Bank may reasonably request. 
 (b)	Promptly after receipt of any L/C Application the relevant Issuing Bank will confirm with the Revolver Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Revolver Agent has received a copy of such L/C Application from the Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Bank will provide the Revolver Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the relevant Issuing Bank of confirmation from the Revolver Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or, if applicable, for the benefit of Holdings or a Subsidiary of the Borrower) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby immediately irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the relevant Issuing Bank a risk participation in 
 130 

such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
 (c)	If the Borrower so requests in any applicable L/C Application, the relevant Issuing Bank shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit ); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit may permit the relevant Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon by the relevant Issuing Bank and the Borrower at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise agreed in such Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the applicable Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the applicable L/C Expiration Date, unless the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit will be Cash Collateralized or back-stopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank prior to the applicable L/C Expiration Date; provided that the relevant Issuing Bank shall not be required to allow such extension if (i) the relevant Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(1)(b) or otherwise) or (ii) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Revolver Agent, any Revolving Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.03 will not be satisfied on the applicable date of the Credit Extension. 
 (d)	Promptly after issuance of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Revolver Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 (3)	 Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations . 
 (a)	Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of a compliant drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Revolver Agent thereof (including the date on which such payment is to be made). Not later than noon, New York time on the first Business Day immediately following any payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit with notice to the Borrower (each such date, an Honor Date ), the Borrower shall reimburse, or cause to be reimbursed, such Issuing Bank through the Revolver Agent, in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing; provided that, if such reimbursement is not made on the date of payment by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall pay interest to the relevant Issuing Bank on such amount at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans (without duplication of interest payable on L/C Borrowings). The relevant Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse, or cause to be reimbursed, such Issuing Bank by such time, the Revolver Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Appropriate Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, in the case of an Unreimbursed Amount under a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to have irrevocably requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, unaffected by any circumstance whatsoever, including (without limitation) (x) the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, (y) the fact that, whether before or after giving effect to the making of any such Revolving Loan, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans exceed or will exceed the Revolving Commitment and/or (z) the non-satisfaction of 
 131 

any conditions set forth in Section 4.02 or Section 4.03 ; provided , however , that in no event shall any Lender be obligated to fund in excess of its Revolving Commitment after giving effect to its share of L/C Obligations (and, to the extent not duplicative, any effect to its share of Revolving Exposure), and without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans. Any notice given by an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.03(3)(a) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (b)	Each Appropriate Lender (including any Lender acting as an Issuing Bank) shall absolutely and unconditionally be obligated, upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(3)(a) , to make funds available to the Revolver Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank in Dollars at the Revolver Agent s Office for payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Revolver Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(3)(c) , each Appropriate Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount and, for the avoidance of doubt, the making of such Base Rate Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Unreimbursed Amount shall satisfy the Borrower s reimbursement obligations with respect thereof. The Revolver Agent shall remit the funds so received to the relevant Issuing Bank. 
 (c)	With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Appropriate Lender s payment to the Revolver Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(3)(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 . 
 (d)	Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(3) to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank. 
 (e)	Each Revolving Lender s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse an Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit as contemplated by this Section 2.03(3) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including: 
 (i)	any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant Issuing Bank (including any claim for improper amount or payment), the Revolver Agent, a Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; 
 (ii)	the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or 
 (iii)	any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. 
 No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 132 

(f)	 If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Revolver Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(3) by the time specified in Section 2.03(3)(b) , such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Revolver Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the relevant Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Revolver Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(3)(f) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (4)	 Repayment of Participations . 
 (a)	If, at any time after an Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(3) , the Revolver Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Revolver Agent), the Revolver Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the amount received by the Revolver Agent. 
 (b)	If any payment received by the Revolver Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(3)(a) or Section 2.03(3)(b) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the Revolver Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Revolver Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The Obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this Section 2.03(4)(b) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 (5)	 Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
 (a)	any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; 
 (b)	the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense (including any claim for improper payment) or other right that any Loan Party may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the relevant Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
 (c)	any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
 133 

(d)	any payment by the relevant Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the relevant Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
 (e)	any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of any Loan Party in respect of such Letter of Credit; 
 (f)	any affiliation between the Issuing Bank and the Revolver Agent; or 
 (g)	any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party; 
 provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by acts or omissions by such Issuing Bank constituting gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Bank as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 (6)	 Role of Issuing Banks . Each Issuing Bank shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate or facsimile message, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by any Person that such Issuing Bank reasonably believed to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Loan Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by such Issuing Bank (which may include, at the Issuing Bank s option, counsel of the Revolver Agent or the Borrower). Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Banks, any Related Person of such Issuing Banks, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for 
 (a)	any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders, the Required Lenders or the Required Facility Lenders in respect of the Revolving Commitments, as applicable; 
 (b)	any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction; or 
 (c)	the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or L/C Application. 
 The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, 
 134 

and shall not, preclude the Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Banks, any Related Persons of such Issuing Banks, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any Issuing Bank, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (f) of Section 2.03(5) ; provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Bank s willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence or such Issuing Bank s willful or grossly negligent, or bad faith, failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of document(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit, in each case as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 Each Revolving Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, indemnify each Issuing Bank, its Related Persons and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence or such Issuing Bank s willful or grossly negligent, or bad faith, failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of documents(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit in each case as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Section 2.03 or any action taken or omitted to be taken by such indemnitees hereunder. 
 (7)	 Cash Collateral . Subject to Section 2.17(1)(d) , if, 
 (a)	as of any L/C Expiration Date, any applicable Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, 
 (b)	any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Revolver Agent, upon the direction of the Required Revolver Lenders, requires the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02 or 
 (c)	an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(6) occurs and is continuing, 
 the Borrower will Cash Collateralize, or cause to be Cash Collateralized, the then Outstanding Amount of all relevant L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to 103 of such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default or the applicable L/C Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do so not later than 2:00 p.m., New York time, on (i) in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (a) or b) , (x) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12:00 p.m., New York time, or (y) if clause (x) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice and (ii) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (c) , the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(6) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Revolver Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower will Cash Collateralize all Fronting Exposure (after 
 135 

giving effect to Section 2.17(1)(d) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).

 (b)	If any payment received by the relevant Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by such Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to such Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Revolver Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate.

The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender 
 156 

shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent, as set forth in the Register, in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.

 (3)	Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Sections 2.11(1) and (2) , and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Sections 2.11(1) and (2) , shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error. 
 Section 2.12	 Payments Generally. 
 (1)	All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall be made in Dollars without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Applicable Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Applicable Agent s Office for payment and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m., New York time, on the date specified herein. The Applicable Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00 p.m., New York time, may in the Applicable Agent s discretion be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day (but the Applicable Agent may extend such deadline for purposes of computing interest and fees (but not beyond the end of such day) in its sole discretion whether or not such payments are in process). 
 (2)	Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
 (3)	Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Applicable Agent, prior to the date, or in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of such Borrowing, any payment is required to be made by it to the Applicable Agent hereunder (in the case of the Borrower, for the account of any Lender or an Issuing Bank hereunder or, in the case of 
 157 

the Lenders, for the account of any Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender or the Borrower hereunder), that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Applicable Agent in Same Day Funds, then: 
 (a)	if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender or Issuing Bank shall forthwith on demand repay to the Applicable Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender or Issuing Bank in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Applicable Agent to such Lender or Issuing Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Applicable Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect; and 
 (b)	if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Applicable Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Applicable Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Applicable Agent (the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to the Applicable Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Applicable Agent s demand therefor, the Applicable Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount, or cause such amount to be paid, to the Applicable Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Applicable Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. A notice of the Applicable Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(3) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (c)	If any Lender makes available to the Applicable Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Applicable Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Section 4.03 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Applicable Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (d)	The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or fund any participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (e)	Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (f)	Whenever any payment received by the Applicable Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Applicable Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Applicable Agent and applied by the Applicable 
 158 

Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03 (or otherwise expressly set forth herein). If the Applicable Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Applicable Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. 
 Section 2.13	 Sharing of Payments. Other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, if any Lender of any Class shall obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on account of the Loans of such Class made by it or the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (1) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (2) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans of such Class made by them or such sub-participations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of any principal of or interest on such Loans of such Class or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (i) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (ii) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.10 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. For purposes of clause (3) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, any participation acquired by a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be treated as having been acquired on the earlier date(s) on which the applicable interest(s) in the Commitment(s) or Loan(s) to which such participation relates were acquired by such Lender. 
 Section 2.14	 Incremental Facilities. 
 (1)	 Incremental Loan Request . The Borrower may at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, by written notice to the Applicable Agent (an Incremental Loan Request ), request (a) one or more new commitments which may be of the same Class as any outstanding Term

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders any such documentation (including any specific documentation required below in this Section 3.01(3) obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and Administrative Agent of its legal ineligibility to do so. 
 Without limiting the foregoing: 
 (a)	Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-9 (or successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding. 
 (b)	Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it is legally eligible to do so, shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable: 
 (i)	two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for the benefits of an income Tax treaty to which the United States is a party, and such other documentation as required under the Code, 
 (ii)	two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms), 
 (iii)	in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code, (A) two properly completed and duly signed United States Tax Compliance Certificates and (B) two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms), 
 (iv)	to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner of an interest in a Loan or Commitment hereunder (for example, where such Foreign Lender is a partnership), two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of such Foreign Lender, accompanied by an IRS Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY and any other required information (or any successor forms) from each beneficial owner that would be required under this Section 3.01(3) if such beneficial owner were a Lender, as applicable provided that, if a Lender is a partnership and if one or more beneficial owners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Foreign Lender on behalf of such beneficial owner(s)), or 
 180 

(v)	two properly completed and duly signed copies of any other documentation prescribed by applicable U.S. federal income Tax laws (including the Treasury Regulations) as a basis for claiming a complete exemption from, or a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents. 
 (c)	If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c) , the term FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, if a Lender is an entity disregarded from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, references to the foregoing documentation are intended to refer to documentation with respect to such Lender s owner and, as applicable, such Lender. 
 Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(3) , no Lender shall be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 3.01(3) that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent, as applicable, any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01(3) . 
 (4)	Without duplication of other amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01(2) , the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
 (5)	The Loan Parties shall, jointly and severally, indemnify a Lender, the Administrative Agent (each a Tax Indemnitee ), within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes paid or payable by such Tax Indemnitee (including Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01 (other than any interest, penalties and other costs determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Tax Indemnitee), whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the Governmental Authority; provided that if the Borrower reasonably believes that such Taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, such Tax Indemnitee will cooperate with the Borrower to obtain a refund of such Taxes (which shall be repaid to the Borrower in accordance with Section 3.01(6) below so long as such efforts would not, in the sole determination exercised in good faith of such Tax Indemnitee, result in any additional out-of-pocket costs or expenses not reimbursed by such Loan Party or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Tax Indemnitee. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability prepared in good faith and delivered by the Tax Indemnitee, by the Administrative Agent on behalf of another Tax Indemnitee, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 181 

(6)	If and to the extent that a Tax Indemnitee, in its sole discretion (exercised in good faith), determines that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or applied against any other cash Taxes payable) of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes in respect of which it has received indemnification payments or additional amounts under this Section 3.01 , then such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the relevant Loan Party the amount of such refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Tax Indemnitee (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund), and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Loan Party, upon the request of the Tax Indemnitee, shall repay the amount paid over by the Tax Indemnitee plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Tax Indemnitee to the extent the Tax Indemnitee is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(6) , in no event will the Tax Indemnitee be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01(6) the payment of which would place the Tax Indemnitee in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Tax Indemnitee would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require a Tax Indemnitee to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. 
 (7)	On or before the date the Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower whichever of the following is applicable: (a) if the Administrative Agent is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that the Administrative Agent is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding or (b) if the Administrative Agent is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (i) with respect to payments received for its own account, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8ECI and (ii) with respect to payments received on account of any Lender, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (together with all required accompanying documentation) certifying that the Administrative Agent is a Withholding U.S. Branch. At any time thereafter, the Administrative Agent shall provide updated documentation previously provided (or a successor form thereto) when any documentation previously delivered has expired or become obsolete or invalid or otherwise upon the reasonable request of the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(7), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to provide any documentation that the Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver as a result of a Change in Law after the date it becomes an Administrative Agent. 
 (8)	The agreements in this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, or the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 (9)	For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 3.01 , the term Lender includes any Issuing Bank and any Swing Line Lender. 
 Section 3.02	 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Term Benchmark Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term Benchmark Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on written notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (1) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be suspended and (2) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining 
 182 

Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term Benchmark Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term Benchmark Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (a) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans and shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term Benchmark Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term Benchmark Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Rate Loans and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Term Benchmark Rate component of the Base Rate with respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term Benchmark Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term Benchmark Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
 Section 3.03	 Inability to Determine Rates. 
 If the Administrative Agent (in the case of clause (a) or (b) below) or the Required Lenders (in the case of clause (c) below) reasonably determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Term Benchmark Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof: 
 (a)	Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof, 
 (b)	adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Term Benchmark Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term Benchmark Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or 
 (c)	the Term Benchmark Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term Benchmark Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, 
 the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term Benchmark Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term Benchmark Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term Benchmark Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
 183 

Section 3.04	 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Term Benchmark Rate Loans. 
 (1)	 Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 
 (a)	impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; 
 (b)	subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and any Excluded Taxes); or 
 (c)	impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (in each case, other than with respect to Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Term Benchmark Rate Loans made by such Lender that is not otherwise accounted for in the definition of Term Benchmark Rate or this clause (1) ; 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Term Benchmark Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that such amounts shall only be payable by the Borrower to the applicable Lender under this Section 3.04(1) so long as such Lender certifies that it is such Lender s general policy or practice to demand compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other financing agreements. 
 (2)	 Capital Requirements . If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by it, or participations in or issuance of Letters of Credit by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company, as the case may be, could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower will pay to such Lender additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided that such amounts shall only be payable by the Borrower to the applicable Lender under this Section 3.04(2) so long as it is such Lender s general policy or practice to demand compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other financing agreements. 
 (3)	 Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (1) or (2) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive 
 184 

absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof. 
 Section 3.05	 Funding Losses. Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by it as a result of: 
 (1)	any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Term Benchmark Rate Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
 (2)	any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Term Benchmark Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 
 (3)	any assignment of a Term Benchmark Rate Loan on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.07 ; including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits or margin) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Term Benchmark Rate Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender may make any demand under this Section 3.05 with respect to the floor specified in the proviso to the definition of Adjusted Term SOFR. 
 Section 3.06	 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation. 
 (1)	 Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 , or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as applicable, and (b) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material economic, legal or regulatory respect. 
 (2)	 Suspension of Lender Obligations . If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under Section 3.04 , the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark Rate Loans from one Interest Period to another Interest Period, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Term Benchmark Rate Loans until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.06(3) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested. 
 (3)	 Conversion of Term Benchmark Rate Loans . If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender s Term Benchmark Rate Loans no longer 
 185 

exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Term Benchmark Rate Loans made by other Lenders, as applicable, are outstanding, such Lender s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Term Benchmark Rate Loans to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans of a given Class held by the Lenders of such Class holding Term Benchmark Rate Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 
 (4)	 Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Sections 3.01 or 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 3.01 or 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event giving rise to such claim and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 Section 3.07	 Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. If (1) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or ceases to make Term Benchmark Rate Loans as a result of any condition described in Section 3.02 or Section 3.04 , (2) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , (3) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, (4) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (5) any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, 
 (a)	require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.07), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (or, with respect to clause (3) above, all of its interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, waiver, or amendment, as applicable) and the related Loan Documents to one or more Eligible Assignees that shall assume such obligations (any of which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
 (i)	the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.07(2)(d) ; 
 (ii)	such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the applicable outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) and (solely in connection with any amendment, amendment and restatement or other modification to this Agreement which reduces, waives or modifies the premium set forth in Section 2.18 its pro rata share (as determined immediately prior to being so replaced) of any prepayment premium pursuant to Section 2.18 that would otherwise be owed in connection therewith as if such Loan were being prepaid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(1)(a) at the time of such assignment and delegation) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of such prepayment premium and all other amounts); 
 (iii)	such Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall (I) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to all, or a portion, as applicable, of such Lender s 
 186 

Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans and (II) deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or Administrative Agent (or a lost or destroyed note indemnity in lieu thereof); provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Notes shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and the Notes shall be deemed to be canceled upon such failure; 
 (iv)	the Eligible Assignee shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification and confidentiality provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender; 
 (v)	in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
 (vi)	such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; 
 (vii)	any Lender that acts as an Issuing Bank may not be replaced hereunder at any time when it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the depositing of Cash Collateral into a Cash Collateral Account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank) have been made with respect to each such outstanding Letter of Credit; and 
 (viii)	the Lender that acts as Administrative Agent cannot be replaced in its respective capacity as Administrative Agent other than in accordance with Section 9.11 ; or 
 (b)	terminate the Commitment of such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and (i) in the case of a Lender (other than an Issuing Bank), repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date (including any prepayment premium pursuant to Section 2.18 that would otherwise be owed to such Lender in connection therewith) and (ii) in the case of an Issuing Bank, repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Issuing Bank relating to the Loans and participations held by such Issuing Bank as of such termination date and Cash Collateralize, cancel or backstop, or provide for the deemed reissuance under another facility, on terms satisfactory to such Issuing Bank any Letters of Credit issued by it; provided that in the case of any such termination of the Commitment of a Non-Consenting Lender such termination shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of the applicable consent, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents and such termination shall, with respect to clause (3) above, be in respect of all of its interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, waiver and amendment. 
 In the event that (1) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that the Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or agree to any amendment thereto, (2) the consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of each Lender, all affected Lenders or all the Lenders or all affected Lenders with respect to a certain Class or Classes of the Loans/Commitments and (3) the Required Lenders or Required Facility Lenders, as applicable, have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender . 
 187

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, the Arranger is named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its capacity as such shall have no powers, duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; it being understood and agreed that the Arranger shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Arranger as, and to the extent, provided for under Section 10.05 . Without limitation of the foregoing, the Arranger shall not, solely by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or any other Person. 
 Section 9.04	 Lack of Reliance on the Agent. Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or Revolver Agent, the Arranger and their respective Affiliates, each Lender and the holder of each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (a) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Holdings, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (b) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Holdings, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries and, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, Revolver Agent and the Arranger and any of their respective Affiliates shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent, the Revolver Agent, the Arranger and any of their respective Affiliates shall not be responsible to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, 
 249 

collectability, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the financial condition of Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the financial condition of Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. The Agents may in good faith ask for such information or support it may deem reasonably necessary to confirm that one or more lenders in fact constitute either the Required Lenders, Required Facility Lenders, Required Term Loans or Required Revolving Lenders under any Facility before taking or declining to take any action under a Loan Document and none of the Agents shall be deemed to be liable to any Lender for so taking or so declining to take such action until it shall have received such information so reasonably requested. 
 Section 9.05	 Certain Rights of the Agent. If the Applicable Agent requests instructions from the Required Lenders, Required Facility Lenders, Required Term Lenders or Required Revolver Lenders (as applicable) with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Applicable Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the Applicable Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders, Required Facility Lenders, Required Term Lenders or Required Revolver Lenders (as applicable); and the Applicable Agent shall not incur liability to any Lender by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, neither any Lender nor the holder of any Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Applicable Agent as a result of the Applicable Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders, Required Facility Lenders, Required Term Lenders or Required Revolver Lenders (as applicable). 
 Section 9.06	 Reliance by the Agent. The Applicable Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or facsimile message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by any Person that the Applicable Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Loan Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by the Applicable Agent. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan or the issuance, extension or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or Issuing Bank, the Applicable Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or issuances of such Letter of Credit. The Applicable Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 Section 9.07	 Delegation of Duties. The Applicable Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Documents by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Applicable Agent. The Applicable Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Agent-Related Persons. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Agent-Related Persons of the Applicable Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as Applicable Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.07 or Section 9.14 , the Applicable Agent shall not delegate to any Supplemental Administrative Agent or Supplemental Revolver Agent (as applicable) responsibility for receiving any payments under any Loan Document for the account of any Lender, which payments shall be received directly by the 
 250 

Applicable Agent without prior written consent of the Borrower (not to unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
 Section 9.08	 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, to the extent any of the Administrative Agent, Revolver Agent or any other of their Agent-Related Persons (solely to the extent any such Agent-Related Person was performing services on behalf of the Administrative Agent or Revolver Agent) or Issuing Bank is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify any of the Administrative Agent, Revolver Agent or any other of their Agent-Related Person (solely to the extent any such Agent-Related Person was performing services on behalf of the Administrative Agent or Revolver Agent) or Issuing Bank in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, responsibilities, fines, sanctions, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits, judgments, costs, fees, Taxes, commissions, charges, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by any of the Administrative Agent, Revolver Agent or any other of their Agent-Related Persons (solely to the extent any such Agent-Related Person was performing services on behalf of the Administrative Agent or Revolver Agent) or Issuing Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken in performing its duties hereunder, under any other Loan Document, under any Letter of Credit or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the Letters of Credit; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, responsibilities, fines, sanctions, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, fees, Taxes, commissions, charges, expenses or disbursements resulting from any of the Applicable Agent s, any other of its Agent-Related Person s or Issuing Bank s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Applicable Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Applicable Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Applicable Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower, provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrower s continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto, provided further that the failure of any Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Applicable Agent shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.08 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. The undertaking in this Section 9.08 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
 Section 9.09	 The Agent in Its Individual Capacity.

 (1)	to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, any Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, any Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, any Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04 allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
 254 

(2)	to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
 and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and relevant Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04 .

In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection with any such bid (a) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (b) to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Equity Interests thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in clauses (a) through (i) of the first proviso to Section 10.01(1) of this Agreement), (c) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a result of which each of the Lenders shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by such an acquisition vehicle on account of the assignment of the Obligations to be credit bid, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action and (d) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. 
 255

 (1)	It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a Supplemental Administrative Agent and collectively as Supplemental Administrative Agents ). 
 (2)	In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral, (a) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Administrative Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent and (b) the provisions of this Article IX and of Sections 10.04 and 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Administrative Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, as the context may require. 
 (3)	Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be reasonably required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments reasonably acceptable to it promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Administrative Agent. 
 Section 9.15	 Intercreditor Agreements. The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent are hereby authorized to enter into any Intercreditor Agreement to the extent contemplated by the terms hereof, and the parties hereto acknowledge that such Intercreditor Agreement is (and shall be) binding upon them.

 256 

intercreditor agreement to provide for the incurrence of any Indebtedness permitted hereunder that will be secured on a junior lien or pari passu basis to the Obligations). 
 In addition, each Secured Party hereby authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into (a) any amendments to any Intercreditor Agreements, and (b) any other intercreditor arrangements, in the case of the clauses (a) and (b) to the extent required to give effect to the establishment of intercreditor rights and privileges as contemplated and required or permitted by this Agreement (including any such amendment (or amendment and restatement) of any intercreditor agreement to provide for the incurrence of any Indebtedness permitted hereunder that will be secured on a junior lien or pari passu basis to the Obligations). Each Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that any of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (or one or more of their respective Affiliates) may (but are not obligated to) act as the Debt Representative or like term for the holders of Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness under the security agreements with respect thereto or any Intercreditor Agreement then in effect. Each Lender waives any conflict of interest, now contemplated or arising hereafter, in connection therewith and agrees not to assert against any Agent or any of its affiliates any claims, causes of action, damages or liabilities of whatever kind or nature relating thereto.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or in any Guaranty or any Collateral Document, no Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 8.03 , any Guaranty or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guaranty or any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. 
 Section 9.17	 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable Laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 3.01 , each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, all Taxes and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective), whether or not such Taxes are correctly or legally imposed or asserted. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent within 10 days after demand therefor, for (a) any Non-Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (b) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.07(5) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (c) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the 
 257 

amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.17 . The agreements in this Section 9.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

 287 

provisions of this paragraph, all without the further consent or joinder of any Lender or Issuing Bank. Any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such released Collateral or Guarantor shall no longer be deemed to be repeated. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Guarantor shall be released from its Guarantee of the Obligations pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Excluded Subsidiary other than to the extent such Guarantor becomes non-wholly-owned solely as a result of a bona fide joint venture arrangement with a third party that is not an Affiliate of Holdings or the Sponsor pursuant to an Investment permitted under Section 7.05 , valued in an amount equal to the fair market value of such Guarantor at the time of such transaction. 
 (2)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when the Termination Conditions are satisfied, upon request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Collateral, and to release all obligations under any Loan Document, whether or not on the date of such release there may be any (a) Hedging Obligations in respect of any Secured Hedge Agreements, (b) Cash Management Obligations in respect of any Secured Cash Management Agreements, (c) Contingent Obligations not then due and (d) Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations related to any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, backstopped by a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank.

 Section 10.25	 Separate Obligations. Each Term Creditor acknowledges and agrees that because of their differing rights in proceeds of the Collateral, the Obligations arising under or in respect of the Term Loans are fundamentally different from the Obligations arising under or in respect of the Revolving Loans and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization proposed or confirmed in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving any Borrower or Guarantor as a debtor. No Term Creditor shall seek in any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding to be treated as part of the same class of creditors as the Revolving Creditors or shall oppose any pleading or motion by the Revolving Creditors for the Revolving Creditors and the Term Creditors to be treated as separate classes of creditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and regardless of whether the Obligations arising under or in respect of the Term Loans and the Obligations arising under or in respect of the Revolving Loans are separately classified in any such plan of reorganization, the Term Creditors hereby acknowledge and agree that to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of the Obligations arising under or in respect of the Revolving Loans, the Revolving Creditors shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of interest, and fees, costs and charges incurred subsequent to the commencement of the applicable bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding (regardless of whether such interest, and fees, costs and charges incurred subsequent to the commencement of the applicable bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is allowed as part of the claims of the Revolving Creditors under 
 288 

section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) before any distribution (whether pursuant to a plan of reorganization or otherwise) is made in respect of any of the claims held by the Term Creditors. The Term Creditors hereby acknowledge and agree to hold in trust for the benefit of the Revolving Creditors and to turn over to the Revolving Creditors all distributions received or receivable by them in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding (whether pursuant to a plan of reorganization or otherwise) to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of the preceding sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Term Creditors.

Solely as among the Administrative Agent, the Revolver Agent, the Revolving Lenders and the Term Lenders (and whether or not the Administrative Agent is directed to terminate the Revolving Commitments by the Required Revolving Lenders), the Administrative Agent shall, absent Exigent Circumstances give to the Term Lenders, at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice, or, should Exigent Circumstances arise or exist, such prior or contemporary notice as may be practicable under the circumstances before terminating the Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 8.02.

 (c)	 the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
