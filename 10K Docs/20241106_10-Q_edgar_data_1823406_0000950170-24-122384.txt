These corporate securities are accounted for as securities, but are underwritten as loans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. Accordingly, the Bank monitors the credit quality of these corporate bonds through quarterly credit reviews to determine impairment, if any. At September 30, 2024 , these securities are all rated as investment grade and the of allowance for credit losses associated with these securities was calculated using a Moody's report on the cumulative default rates of corporate issuers.

 available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater totaling million as of September 30, 2024 . The unrealized losses on the debt securities arose due to changing interest rates and market conditions and are considered to be temporary because of acceptable investment grades and are reviewed regularly. of the securities are agency bonds and are U.S. Treasury bonds, so all of these are direct obligations of the U.S. Government. of the securities are mortgage-backed bonds that have the direct or implied backing of the U.S. Government. of the bonds are municipal securities and the remaining securities are corporate securities that are either trust preferred securities or subordinated debentures where the Bank performs a credit review regularly and such review has raised no concerns. Debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"), and the U.S. Treasury, including notes and mortgage-backed securities, accounted for the majority of the available-for-sale portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and the Bank expects no credit losses on these securities, given the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. federal government. The available-for-sale portfolio also includes corporate securities, but are underwritten as loans with features that are typically found in commercial loans. Accordingly, the Bank monitors the credit quality of these corporate bonds through quarterly credit reviews to determine impairment, if any. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality, and the Bank does not have the intent to sell the U.S. government and agencies debt securities and the corporate securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Bank does not consider impairments on these securities to be credit related as of September 30, 2024.

Collateral-Dependent Loans We classify a loan as collateral-dependent when our borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. Our commercial loans have collateral that is comprised of real estate and business assets. Our consumer loans have collateral that is substantially comprised of residential real estate. There were no significant changes in the extent to which collateral secures our collateral-dependent loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and we had million and million, respectively, of

Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on many judgments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include deferred income taxes and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total assets increased 35.3 million, or 4.2 , to 878.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 843.3 million at December 31, 2023, due primarily to an increase in loans.

 Total deposits increased 9.3 million, or 1.4 , to 683.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 674.4 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting increases in demand deposits and money market accounts. Demand deposits increased 9.2 million, or 3.9 , and money market accounts increased 12.6 million or, 9.1 as a result of our business customers' cyclical demands at year-end. Our certificates of deposit include brokered deposits at September 30, 2024, totaling 107.3 million, which had an average life of 22 months and an average interest rate of 4.65 .

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General. Net income was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was caused by an increase in net interest income offset partially by an increase in noninterest expense. 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 1.3 million, or 11.6 , to 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income from loans. Interest income on loans increased 1.5 million, or 16.3 , to 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased 56 basis points to 6.03 for the current quarter, as compared to 5.47 for the prior year period, due to the continued changes in the interest rate environment. In addition, our average balance of loans increased by 38.4 million, or 5.8 , to 698.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 660.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of loans increased due to steady loan demand. 
 Interest income on interest-earning deposits and federal funds decreased 221,000 to 668,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 889,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-earning deposits and federal funds decreased 16.6 million to 52.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 68.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The yields we received on these funds decreased to 5.09 from 5.12 due to the continued changes in the interest rate environment . 
 27 

Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 765,000 to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to increases in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities as well as the rates paid. 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased 272,000 to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The largest increase was in interest expense on money market accounts, which increased 251,000 to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average rate we paid on money market accounts increased 55 basis points to 3.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the continued changes in the interest rate environment and an increase in the average balance increase of 7.0 million to 149.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 142.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest expense on borrowings increased 493,000 to 701,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 208,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to additional borrowings taken in the first and third quarters of 2024. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 513,000, or 7.4 , to 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest rate spread increased to 2.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and our net interest margin increased to 3.52 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the yields we earned on our interest-earning assets increased faster than the rates we paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The provisions for credit losses consists of provisions for credit losses for loans and unfunded loan commitments, as well as held-to-maturity securities. 
 Provisions for credit losses for loans are charged to operations to establish an allowance for credit losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for credit losses for loans, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 Provisions for credit losses for unfunded commitments are charged to operations to establish an allowance for credit losses for contractual obligations to extend credit. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate is influenced by historical loss experience, adjusted for current risk characteristics, and economic factors. 
 Provisions for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities are also charged to operations to establish an allowance on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of expected credit losses for held-to-maturity securities considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 After an evaluation of these factors, we recorded no provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. Our allowance for credit losses was 8.4 million at September 30, 2024, 8.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 9.2 million at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.20 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.35 at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans was 172.4 at September 30, 2024 compared to 120.1 at December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were 63,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loan charge-offs of 41,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all credit losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at September 30, 2024. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for credit losses. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process of establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

Professional fees increased 196,000 related to costs associated with our proposed purchase and assumption agreement with Atlanta Postal Credit Union. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. We recorded income tax expense of 546,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 502,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 24.0 and 23.6 for the respective periods. 
 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 	 General. Net income was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was caused by increases in noninterest expenses and the provision for credit losses that were partially offset by an increase in net interest income. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 4.1 million, or 13.1 , to 35.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases in income from loans and investment securities offset by a decrease in income from interest-earning deposits. Interest income on loans increased 4.4 million, or 17.0 , to 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our average balance of loans increased by 22.5 million, or 3.4 , to 681.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 659.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of loans increased due to steady loan demand. The average yield on loans increased 69 basis points to 5.99 for the current period, as compared to 5.30 for the prior year period, due to the continued changes in the interest rate environment. 
 	Interest income on interest-earning deposits and federal funds decreased 563,000 to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of interest-earning deposits and federal funds decreased 18.2 million to 51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 69.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we held excess cash to increase liquidity. The yields we received on these funds increased to 5.13 from 4.87 due to the continued changes in the interest rate environment. 
 
 Interest income on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities increased 96,000 to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of securities was 81.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 83.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 2.9 million to 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to additional borrowings taken in the first and third quarters of 2024. Average borrowings increased 20.0 million to 53.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We recognized increases in most categories of interest expense. Interest expense on deposits increased to 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest increase was in interest expense on certificates of deposit, which increased 1.2 million to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average rate we paid on certificates of deposit increased 55 basis points to 4.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the continued changes in the interest rate environment. In addition, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased 10.9 million to 218.6 million for the nine months 
 29 

ended September 30, 2024 from 207.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as customers increased deposits in higher-yielding accounts due to the current interest rate environment. We also experienced an increase in interest expense on money market accounts of 1.0 million to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in the rates we paid on these accounts of 84 basis points. 
 	Interest expense on borrowings increased to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 1.2 million, or 6.1 , to 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest rate spread increased to 2.59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and our net interest margin increased to 3.54 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as yields we earned on our interest-earning assets increased faster than the rates we paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses. We recorded provisions for credit losses of 213,000 and 7,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our allowance for credit losses was 8.4 million at September 30, 2024, 8.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 9.2 million at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.20 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.35 at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans was 172.4 at September 30, 2024 compared to 120.1 at December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were 523,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 114,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Non-interest Income. Non-interest income decreased 5,000 to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Management of Market Risk 
 General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. 
 30 

We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 limiting our reliance on non-core/wholesale funding sources; 

growing our volume of transaction deposit accounts; 

increasing our investment securities portfolio, with an average maturity of less than 15 years; 

diversifying our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans and consumer loans, which typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments; and 

continuing to price our one-to-four family residential real estate loan products in a way that encourages borrowers to select our balloon loans as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate loans. 

By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases in market interest rates. In addition, we originate adjustable-rate, one-to-four-family residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. 
 We do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. 
 Net Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by 200 and 400 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

 The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 0.15 increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 4.20 decrease in net interest income. At September 30, 2023, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 0.87 increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 4.20 decrease in net interest income. 
 31 

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. 
 Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At September 30, 2024, we had a 218.6 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, with advances of 54.0 million outstanding and a 12.5 million letter of credit outstanding, and we had a 5.0 million unsecured federal funds line of credit, a 7.5 million unsecured federal funds line of credit, and a 20.0 million unsecured federal funds line of credit. We also had a line of 74.8 million with the Federal Reserve Bank secured by 101.5 million in loans and investment securities. At September 30, 2024, we had 4.8 million outstanding under the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities was 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities typically consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and any purchases of investment securities. Net cash provided by financing activities, which consists primarily of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds/repayments of borrowings, was 28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which included net proceeds from borrowing of 18.8 million from the Federal Reserve Bank compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 58.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,which reflected increases in deposits accounts and 65 million in FHLB advances, partially offset by repaying 55.0 million of FHLB borrowings, and repurchasing stock of 3.0 million. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.

Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 80.9 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 96.6 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 
 Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.
