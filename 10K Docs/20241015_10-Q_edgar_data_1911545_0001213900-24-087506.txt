SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management,
and which statements involve substantial risk and uncertainties. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other
than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy
and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking statements. Forward- looking statements
generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward- looking statements
because they contain words such as may, will, should, expects, plans, 
 anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, 
 believes, estimates, predicts, potential, or continue or the negative
of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. 

These risks and uncertainties include, among other
things, the risk that we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy due to the following reasons; 

overall strength and stability of general economic conditions and of the social media platform and content creation industry in the United States and globally; 

changes in consumer demand for, and acceptance of, our services, including our platform, as well as social media platforms in general; 

changes in the competitive environment, including adoption of technologies, services and products that compete with our own; 

our expectations regarding our future operating and financial performance; 

the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, and needs for additional financing; 

our ability to continue as a going concern; 

our ability to effectively execute our business plan and continue to expand internationally; 

our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate skilled personnel, including key members of senior management; 

changes in the price of equipment, network infrastructure, hosting and maintenance; 

uncertainties around the successful improvement and modification of our existing applications and development of new products and services, which may require significant expenditures and time; 

changes in laws or regulations governing our business and operations; 

our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and financing sources and an appropriate level of debt on terms favorable to us; 

our ability to effectively market our services; 

costs and risks associated with litigation brought against us; 

our ability to obtain and protect our existing intellectual property protections, including trademarks and copyrights; 

changes in accounting principles, or their application or interpretation, and our ability to make estimates and the assumptions underlying the estimates, which could have an effect on earnings; 

our ability to maintain the listing of our shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other exchange; and 

other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC. 

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements
as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily
on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties,
and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and found on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December
31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or
to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. 

In addition, statements that we believe 
and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available
to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements,
such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive
inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and you are cautioned
not to unduly rely upon these statements.

 and as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Also, the Company has operating losses of and 
for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for twelve (12) months after the issuance date of these financial statements. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of us to continue as a going concern. 

Our future operations are dependent upon multiple
factors, including (i) the success of our FANTOO platform business; (ii) competition from existing and future services from
other companies; and (iii) securing new sources of capital to fund operations and develop markets. We will maintain an ongoing effort
to improve and innovate FANTOO platform business to generate funds for our operations. For instance, we recently launched FANTOO House
which is located in Seoul, and at FANTOO platform, we will launch (i) Epic branded ecommerce platform that we will expect it as a major
source of new income, and (ii) dedicated video production operations that will create short episodic content that focuses on K-POP fandom.
In addition, we maintain an ongoing effort to raise funds for our operations from current investors and new sources of capital through
the issuance of additional common stock and/or short-term notes. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these factors
or that future funding efforts will generate sufficient capital to maintain our operations.

notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq that the Company had been granted
an additional 180 calendar days, or until February 3, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued
listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5450(a)(1), requiring a minimum bid price of per share (the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement ), based on the Company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and
other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023. As discussed in the section titled Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties,
as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited
to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ending December 31, 2023. 

Overview 

Hanryu Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation Hanryu Holdings ), along with our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Hanryu Bank Co., Ltd. HBC ),
FNS Co., Ltd. FNS ), and Marine Island Co., Ltd. Marine Island ), all incorporated under the
laws of the Republic of Korea (collectively, the Company , we , us , or our ),
is the creator of the engaging and innovative social media platform, FANTOO . FANTOO connects users around the world that
share similar interests by providing distinctive service offerings, technologies, applications, and websites. Through FANTOO, we provide
a global multi-media platform for our users to interact with other like-minded users, to share their appreciation of various types of
entertainment and cultures, create their own content, enjoy other users content, engage in commerce, and experience a fandom 
community unlike any other. 

Although we anticipate expanding into additional
entertainment genres, currently, the majority of FANTOO s users are enthusiasts of Korean culture K-Culture ),
also known as the Korean Wave. The growing popularity of the Korean Wave has historically been driven by social networking
services and online video sharing platforms. Through these channels, the dispersion and exportation of Korean arts, music and entertainment
has grown rapidly from a regional influence into a global appreciation of South Korean culture. The expansion of the Korean Wave into
a global phenomenon provides a significant opportunity to unite fans across the globe within the FANTOO platform. We aim to become a leading
global platform for fans who are passionate about the Korean Wave, eventually expanding into other areas of fandom. Since the FANTOO platform
launch in May 2021, its user base has exceeded 27 million users. 

We differentiate ourselves from potential competition
through the power of a fully-integrated platform, and established partnerships with leaders in the K-Culture entertainment industry within
South Korea. Our core strategy is to pursue initiatives that promote the viral growth of our user base, and in doing so, drive advertising
revenue, user-generated revenue, and create other new revenue streams. 

Going Concern 

We have experienced recurring losses from operations
and have a stockholders equity and working capital of 10,566,638 and 8,199,643 as of June 30, 2024, respectively, and 13,068,465
and 10,140,579 as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Also, we have incurred operating losses of 1,738,599 and 5,592,847 for the six
months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern for twelve (12) months after the issuance date of our financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 

25 

Our future operations are dependent upon multiple
factors, including (i) the success of our FANTOO platform business; (ii) competition from existing and future services from
other companies; and (iii) securing new sources of capital to fund operations and develop markets. We will maintain an ongoing effort
to improve and innovate FANTOO platform business to generate funds for our operations. . For instance, we recently opened FANTOO House,
in Seoul, a complex entertainment space for content video production, studio, music broadcasting, and rental (lease). At FANTOO platform,
we plan to launch (i) Epic branded ecommerce platform expected to generate additional income, and (ii) dedicated video production operations
designed to create short episodic content that focuses on K-POP fandom. In addition, we maintain an ongoing effort to raise funds for
our operations from current investors and new sources of capital through the issuance of additional common stock and/or short-term notes.
However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these factors or that future funding efforts will generate sufficient capital
to maintain our operations. As a result, the Company has concluded that management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our Business Model and Growth Strategies 

We focus on providing user-centric services to
provide a single platform that can address and satisfy all the needs of fans within that platform. FANTOO will enrich users fandom
experience by providing an all-in-one platform for fandom content, including news, popular culture, discussions, live shows, fan creativity.
FANTOO is currently available in 17 languages, with real-time translation services. These real time translation services enable our users
to communicate with each other across the globe without language barriers. For languages that are not available for real-time translation,
the FANTOO platform provides a solution through the use of translation matching services among users. Through the translation matching
services, the FANTOO platform ensures that content is accurately translated and available to a greater number of global fans in their
own languages The FANTOO platform further allows users to freely create and monetize their own content and enables fast and secure user-to-user
sales on the FANTOO platform. 

We intend to create value for our shareholders
through developing multiple revenue streams, including (1) direct sales revenue, driven by advertisement, content and commerce sales 
and (2) revenue derived from collecting a percentage of user-to-user sales of emojis, online stickers, web novels, webtoons, translation
matching, and other user-to-user transactions. 

In the long term, we expect the majority of our
revenue will be generated from commissions from user-to-user transactions. Deriving revenue from user-to-user transactions gives our platform
an advantage over other existing platforms that primarily rely on advertisement sales. We recognize both the creative power and purchasing
power of our users and fans in general, and as such, we designed our platform to maximize the economic effects of FANTOO users. Since
May 2022, we have experienced a significant growth in the number of FANTOO users. 

Due to the surge in popularity of K-Culture ,
we believe that we have great potential to continue growing our user base, while maintaining a high percentage of Monthly Active Users MAU s ). According to the Korea Foundation and Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2021, Korean culture had 156.6
million fans in 116 countries, and generated approximately 21.5 billion in global revenue in 2019. Furthermore, K-Culture was ranked
as the seventh most influential global culture in 2021, and contributed over 10 billion in exports in 2020, as reported by the Korean
Foundation for International Cultural Exchange. The global purchasing power of K-Culure was at 124.3 billion in 2020, based on the 2021
report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Financial Overview 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We anticipate that our primary source of revenue
will be generated from FANTOO platform operations. Additionally, we have generated limited revenue from the Company s other subsidiaries 
operations, such as revenue from marketing services, retail sales, and content sales. We started generating revenue from FANTOO business,
and we anticipate earning more steady revenue from the Company s other businesses by the end of 2024. 

We expect that our primary sources of revenue
on the FANTOO platform will be derived from (i) direct sales and (ii) commissions from user-to-user sales. 

Revenue from FANTOO business . We expect
that our primary sources of revenue on the FANTOO platform will be derived from (i) direct sales and (ii) commissions from user-to-user
sales. We started generating revenue from FANTOO platform. 

(i) Direct Sales. From 2023, we began generating
direct sales revenue through: (i) original content sales, such as FANTOO produced web series that can be purchased by users on our
platform or licensed to distributors; (ii) e-commerce goods through FANTOO s Fanshop, which sells items such as the latest
fandom goods and upcoming concert tickets; and (iii) advertising sales, including banner placements, splash advertising, pop-up advertisements
within the platform, in-platform promotions, and branded content productions. For advertising sales, we act as an agent in arranging third-party
promotions to our users. Our business model provides for the distribution of a percentage of our advertising revenue to FANTOO users in
the form of FP as incentives for certain activities within the FANTOO platform. Users can then spend FP within the FANTOO platform to
purchase goods and/or services, either directly from us or from other users. 

(ii) User-to-User Commissions We intend to
generate commissions on user-to-user transactions when FANTOO users sell their own products, content, and services to other users. Users
can sell: (i) items they have created or produced such as emojis, online stickers, web novels, and webtoons; and (ii) tangible
goods or other non-FANTOO platform based fandom items, such as concert tickets. For each sale by a user of content and non-tangible goods,
we intend to collect a percentage of the gross purchase price. For sales of tangible goods and non-FANTOO platform based fandom goods,
transactions are processed through a secure escrow account, for which we will receive a commission based upon the aggregate purchase price
of the transaction. 

Revenue from Retail Sales . Revenue
from retail sales include a wide variety of products for purchase. Although we have generated limited revenue from such services in the
past, we anticipate earning more steady revenue from this business model in 2024. 

Revenue from Marketing Services . Revenue
from marketing services provided by the Company s other subsidiaries such as Hanryu Bank, which will include activities such as
creating and distributing flyers, hosting events and giveaways, producing advertisement videos, and more. Although we have generated limited
revenue from such services in the past, we anticipate earning more steady revenue from this business model by the end of 2024. 

Revenue from News Agency . Revenue
from news agency content sales, which provides news articles and original content to other third-party media outlets. Although we have
generated a de minimis amount of revenue from such services in the past, we anticipate earning more steady revenue from this
business model by the end of 2024. 

As we continue to diversify our product and service
offerings, we anticipate additional revenue streams, including the following: 

Revenue from Entertainment Agency. Our
entertainment agency business is expected to assist influencers in growing their influence base both within and outside of the FANTOO
platform. As each influencer s status grows, we expect to monetize their influencer status through entering into advertisement agreements
or performance-based contracts. We anticipate earning revenue from this business model by the end of 2024. 

While we anticipate generating revenue from sales
of our entertainment agency business by the end of 2024, no assurances can be given that we will successfully launch such affiliated businesses,
and if so, whether such businesses will be successful. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue consists primarily of service
costs, hosting costs, and production costs such as advertising costs, down payments, and royalty payments to artists under entertainment
contracts for original FANTOO platform content, such as web series and concerts. We expect that cost of revenue will increase proportionately
with the growth of the user base for the FANTOO platform. 

27 

Sales, Marketing and Advertising Expense 

Sales and marketing expense consists of compensation
and commission costs of the sales and related support teams, as well as travel, trade show, and other marketing related costs. Advertising
costs are expensed to operations when incurred. Expense also includes the cost of creating and implementing marketing strategies, conducting
market research, and producing advertisements. Those expenses are recognized as incurred based on the accrual basis of accounting. We
expect that sales, advertising, and marketing expense will increase on a proportionate basis with user-growth, and will vary from period-to-period
as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future. This variation is due to our plans to continue to invest in marketing in order
to grow both sales and our user-base by way of increasing brand awareness. The trend and timing of our marketing costs will depend in
part on the timing of marketing campaigns. 

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development expense includes costs
to maintain and develop the FANTOO platform. Costs incurred for research and product development are expensed as incurred and include
salaries, taxes and benefits, contracting, and travel expense related to research and development. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense consists primarily
of personnel-related costs, including salaries and benefits, non-cash stock compensation expense, equipment expense, office and facilities
costs, legal, accounting and other professional fees, public relations costs and other corporate and administrative costs.

Revenues 

We have generated revenue from the FANTOO platform,
and we have started to generate contents sales through FNS and other platforms, including third party news agencies and YouTube. While
the FANTOO platform itself has not yet generated the meaningful revenue, we began implementing our business plan and commenced distributing
content to build and raise brand awareness. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 198t, as compared to revenue of 265,546
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease of 265,533 was due to 193,717 in advertising and content sales through FANTOO
platform and FNS and 71,816 in product sales thorough Hanryu Bank and FNS in the period ended June 30, 2023 compared to no such sales
in the corresponding period in 2024. The substantial decrease in revenue is principally attributable by the restructuring of the FANTOO
platform and the strategic decision of the management. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenue for six months ended June 30,
2024 and 2023 was 0, and 69,145, respectively. The substantial decrease in cost of revenue is principally due to the substantial decrease
in revenue reported during the six-month period ending June 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

Marketing and Advertising 

Marketing and advertising expense for the six
months ended June 30, 2024 was 3,446, as compared to 832,755 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the restructuring
of the FANTOO platform and the strategic decision of the management to improve FANTOO platform to efficiently reach the targeted users. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expense for the six months
ended June 30, 2024 was 0, as compared to 231,743 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expense
is primarily due to the restructuring of the FANTOO platform and the strategic decision of the management. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expense for the six
months ended June 30, 2024 was 1,735,311 as compared to 4,724,973 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease of 2,989,662
was primarily due to a decrease in commissions and consulting costs of 853,773, a decrease in labor related costs of 1,274,566, and
a decrease in travel expense of 679,686. The substantial decrease in general and administrative expense is principally attributable to
the decrease in consulting costs, labor related costs and travel expense by the restructuring of the FANTOO platform and the strategic
decision of the management. 

Other income (expense) 

Other income (expense) for the six months ended
June 30, 2024 was 129,588 an increase of 147,659 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by 173,086
of the interest income. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow in operating
activities. We have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses from operations before income taxes of 1,608,971 and 6,059,252
for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We used 490,256 and 13,683,164 of cash for operating activities for the
six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
 946. Based on our available cash resources and current operating plan, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that its financial statements for the six months ended
June 30, 2024 are issued. The Company s existing capital resources, including the net proceeds from its IPO will not be sufficient
to enable it to continue its operation as planned. The Company will need to raise substantial additional funds in the future in order
to continue its operations. Our cash needs will depend on numerous factors, including our revenues, completion of our product development
activities, customer and market acceptance of our platform, and our ability to reduce and control costs. 

We expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable
future for the development of our technologies and platform infrastructure. We will require additional financing to further develop and
market our platform business, and otherwise execute our business plan. Our current financial condition raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies. 

In July 2023, we consummated our IPO of 877,328 shares of its common
stock at a public offering price of 10.00 pper share, generating gross proceeds of 8,773,280. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately
 7.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately 1.1 million. 

To support our existing and planned business model, we need to raise
additional capital to fund our future operations. We have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through loans and have not experienced
any liquidity problems in settling payables in the normal course of business and repaying loans when they fall due. Successful renewal
of our loans, however, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry conditions under
which we operate may negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Additional debt financing is anticipated to fund our
operations in the near future. However, there are no current agreements or understandings with regard to the form, time or amount of such
financing and there is no assurance that any of this financing can be obtained if at all. As a result, the Company has concluded that
management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We may seek to raise capital through equity offerings or debt financings,
which may include collaboration agreements, or other arrangements with other companies, or through other sources of financing. Adequate
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have
a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.

principal amount of bonds with warrants was approximately 3,239,274. There was no issuance of bonds with warrants for the six months
ended June 30, 2024. A 250,721 decrease in bonds with warrants compared to the balance of 3,489,995 as of December 31, 2023 was due
to currency translation adjustment. 

31 

Contractual Obligations 

As of June 30, 2024, there have been no material
changes to our contractual obligations and other commitments compared to those disclosed on Form 10-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operation is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and
assumptions. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further
information on our significant accounting policies, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the SEC on July 16, 2024. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We have determined that all other issued, but
not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a material
impact on our financial position. Refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, for detailed disclosures regarding the recent
accounting pronouncement. 

Other Information 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

We are an emerging growth company 
(as defined in the JOBS Act) under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth
company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other Exchange
Act reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies, including but not limited to: 

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

taking advantage of extensions of time to comply with certain new or revised financial accounting standards 

being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and 

being exempt from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

We will be subject to ongoing public reporting
requirements that are less rigorous than Exchange Act rules for companies that are not emerging growth companies, and our
stockholders could receive less information than they might expect to receive from more mature public companies. 

We expect to take advantage of these reporting
exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) December
31, 2028 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO), (2) the last day of the fiscal year
in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to
be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business
day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities
during the prior three-year period.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide information under
this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of June 30, 2024. Based
on such evaluation, our interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by
SEC rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 

Management has identified control deficiencies
regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment.
Our management believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of our accounting staff. The small size of our accounting
outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To mitigate the current limited resources and
limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting
professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties
within the internal control framework. 

These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement
of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order
to conclude that our financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly
stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements for
the quarter ended June 30, 2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our interim Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting are designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected .
