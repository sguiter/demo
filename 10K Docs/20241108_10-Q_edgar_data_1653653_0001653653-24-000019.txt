 acres of land for the project into trust for the benefit of the Mono in February 2013. 
 
 Status of obtaining regulatory and governmental approvals: Tribal-state compact A compact was negotiated and signed by the Governor of California and the Mono in August 2012. The California State Assembly and Senate passed Assembly Bill 277 AB 277 which ratified the Compact in May 2013 and June 2013, respectively. Opponents of the North Fork Project qualified a referendum, Proposition 48, for a state-wide ballot challenging the legislature s ratification of the Compact. In November 2014, Proposition 48 failed. The State took the position that the failure of Proposition 48 nullified the ratification of the Compact and, therefore, the Compact did not take effect under California law. In March 2015, the Mono filed suit against the State to obtain a compact with the State or procedures from the Secretary of the Interior under which Class III gaming may be conducted on the North Fork Site. In July 2016, the DOI issued Secretarial procedures (the Secretarial Procedures pursuant to which the Mono may conduct Class III gaming on the North Fork Site. Approval of gaming compact by DOI The Compact was submitted to the DOI in July 2013. In October 2013, notice of the Compact taking effect was published in the Federal Register. The Secretarial Procedures supersede and replace the Compact. Record of decision regarding environmental impact published by BIA In November 2012, the record of decision for the Environmental Impact Statement for the North Fork Project was issued by the BIA. In December 2012, the Notice of Intent to take land into trust was published in the Federal Register. BIA accepting usable land into trust on behalf of the tribe The North Fork Site was accepted into trust in February 2013. Approval of management agreement by NIGC In December 2015, the Mono submitted a Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement, and certain related documents, to the NIGC. In July 2016, the Mono received a deficiency letter from the NIGC seeking additional information concerning the Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement. In March 2018, the Mono submitted the Management Agreement and certain related documents to the NIGC. In June 2018, the Mono received a deficiency letter from the NIGC seeking additional information concerning the Management Agreement. In April 2021, the Mono received an issues letter from the NIGC identifying issues to be addressed prior to approval of the Management Agreement. In September 2022, the Mono received an additional issues letter from the NIGC identifying remaining issues to be addressed prior to approval of the Management Agreement. Following dialogue with the NIGC, the Mono submitted executed North Fork Project agreements to the NIGC in November, 2023. On January 5, 2024, the Chairman of the NIGC approved the Management Agreement. Gaming licenses: Type The North Fork Project will include the operation of Class II and Class III gaming, which are allowed pursuant to the terms of the Secretarial Procedures and IGRA, following approval of the Management Agreement by the NIGC. Number of gaming devices allowed The Secretarial Procedures allow for the operation of a maximum of Class III slot machines at the facility during the first two years of operation and thereafter up to Class III slot machines. There is no limit on the number of Class II gaming devices that the Mono can offer. 
 Agreements with local authorities The Mono has entered into memoranda of understanding with the City of Madera, the County of Madera and the Madera Irrigation District under which the Mono agreed to pay one-time and recurring mitigation contributions, subject to certain contingencies. The memoranda of understanding have all been amended to restructure the timing of certain payments due to delays in the development of the North Fork Project.

 million of reimbursable advances to the Mono, primarily to complete the environmental impact study, purchase the North Fork Site and pay the costs of litigation. The repayment of the advances is expected to come from the proceeds of the North Fork Project s financing, from cash flows from the North Fork Project s operations, or from a combination of both. In accordance with the Company s accounting policy, accrued interest on the advances will not be recognized in income until the carrying amount of the advances has been recovered. The carrying amount of the reimbursable advances was reduced by million to fair value upon the Company s adoption of fresh-start reporting in 2011. At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the advances was million. 
 In addition to the reimbursable advances, the Company expects to receive a development fee of of the costs of construction for its development services, which will be paid upon the commencement of gaming operations at the facility. The Management Agreement provides for the Company to receive a management fee of of the North Fork Project s net income. The repayment of all or a portion of the reimbursable advances is anticipated to be subordinated to the Mono s debt service obligations under the North Fork Project s financing. The Management Agreement has a term of seven years from the opening of the North Fork Project. The Management Agreement includes termination provisions whereby either party may terminate the agreement for cause, and may also be terminated at any time upon agreement of the parties. There is no provision in the Management Agreement allowing the tribe to buy-out the agreement prior to its expiration. The Management Agreement provides that the Company will train the Mono tribal members such that they may assume responsibility for managing the North Fork Project upon the expiration of the agreement. 
 The Company expects that, upon termination or expiration of the Development Agreement, the Mono will continue to be obligated to repay any unpaid principal and interest on the advances from the Company. Amounts due to the Company under the Development Agreement and Management Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the North Fork Project except the North Fork Site. In addition, each of the Development Agreement and the Management Agreement contains waivers of the Mono s sovereign immunity from suit for the purpose of enforcing the agreements or permitting or compelling arbitration and other remedies. 
 The timing of both the North Fork Project and of the repayment of the reimbursable advances is difficult to predict and is contingent on the achievement of the critical milestones, the financing of the North Fork Project, and the cash flows from the North Fork Project. Site work in anticipation of construction commencement has started on the site of the North Fork Project. The Company currently estimates that the North Fork Project will be completed and opened for business in approximately to months. The Company expects to assist the Mono in obtaining financing for the North Fork Project. 
 The Company has evaluated the likelihood that the North Fork Project will be successfully completed and opened, and has concluded that the likelihood of successful completion is in the range of to at September 30, 2024. The Company s evaluation is based on its consideration of all available positive and negative evidence about the status of the North Fork Project, including, but not limited to, the status of required regulatory approvals, as well as the progress being made toward the achievement of any remaining critical milestones, the arrangement of financing for the North Fork Project and the status of any remaining litigation and contingencies. There can be no assurance that all the necessary governmental and regulatory approvals will be obtained, that financing will be obtained, that the financing and/or the cash flows from the North

 The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively, as compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the statutory rate primarily because its effective tax rate includes a rate benefit attributable to the fact that Station Holdco operates as a limited liability company, which is not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, the Company is not taxed on the portion of Station Holdco s income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, the effective tax rate is impacted by the permanent tax benefit attributable to the stock compensation activity from Station Holdco. 
 As a result of the Company s 2016 initial public offering IPO and certain reorganization transactions, the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset resulting from the outside basis difference of its interest in Station Holdco. The Company also recorded a deferred tax asset for its liability related to payments to be made pursuant to the tax receivable agreement TRA representing of the tax savings the Company expects to realize from the amortization deductions associated with the step-up in the basis of depreciable assets under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code. This deferred tax asset will be recovered as cash payments are made to the TRA participants. In addition, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other tax attributes, as applicable. 
 
 Under the 2017 U.S. federal tax year examination, the Internal Revenue Service IRS previously issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment in relation to the 2017 land lease deduction. During the second quarter of 2024, Station Holdco held its appeals conference with the IRS. As a result of the preliminary appeals conference, the Company recorded a current unrecognized tax benefit liability and deferred tax asset associated with the land lease deduction. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company came to a tentative agreement with the IRS and made a deposit equal to the amount the Company expects to owe. No net liability remains on the balance sheet. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the TRA with certain owners who held LLC Units prior to the IPO. In the event that such parties exchange any or all of their LLC Units for Class A common stock or cash, at the election of the Company, the TRA requires the Company to make payments to such holders for of the tax benefits realized by the Company as a result of such exchange. The Company expects to realize these tax benefits based on current projections of taxable income. The annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s liability under the TRA was million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, was payable to Fertitta Family Entities. LLC Units were exchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company made payments on the TRA liability of million and expects to pay million of the TRA liability within the next twelve months.

 The timing and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Company generates each year and the tax rate then applicable. The payment obligations under the TRA are Red Rock s obligations and are not obligations of Station Holdco or Station LLC. Payments are generally due within a specified period of time following the filing of the Company s annual tax return and interest on such payments will accrue from the original due date (without extensions) of the income tax return until the date paid. Payments not made within the required period after the filing of the income tax return generally accrue interest. 
 The TRA will remain in effect until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA. The TRA will also terminate if the Company breaches its obligations under the TRA or upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control. If the Company exercises its right to terminate the TRA, or if the TRA is terminated early in accordance with its terms, the Company s payment obligations would be accelerated based upon certain assumptions, including the assumption that the Company would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize such tax benefits, and may substantially exceed the actual benefits, if any, the Company realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the MD A of Red Rock Resorts, Inc. we, our, us, Red Rock or the Company is intended to help the reader understand the Company s financial condition and results of operations. The MD A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes (the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 Red Rock was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2015 to own an indirect equity interest in and manage Station Casinos LLC Station LLC ), a Nevada limited liability company. Station LLC is a gaming, development and management company established in 1976 that owns and operates seven major gaming and entertainment facilities and 11 smaller gaming properties (three of which are 50 owned) in the Las Vegas regional market. In December 2023, we opened Durango Casino Resort Durango ). 
 We own all of the outstanding voting interests in Station LLC and have an indirect equity interest in Station LLC through our ownership of limited liability company interests in Station Holdco LLC Station Holdco, and such interests, LLC Units ), which owns all of the economic interests in Station LLC. At September 30, 2024, we held 58 of the economic interests and 100 of the voting power in Station Holdco, subject to certain limited exceptions, and we are designated as the sole managing member of both Station Holdco and Station LLC. We control and operate all of the business and affairs of Station Holdco and Station LLC, and conduct all of our operations through these entities. Other than assets and liabilities related to income taxes and the tax receivable agreement, our only material assets are our equity interest in Station Holdco, our voting interest in Station LLC and a note receivable from Station LLC. We have no operations outside of our management of Station Holdco and Station LLC. 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidation of Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, and Station Holdco. The financial position and results of operations attributable to LLC Units we do not own are reported separately as noncontrolling interest. 
 Our principal source of revenue and operating income is gaming, and our non-gaming offerings include restaurants, hotels and other entertainment amenities. Approximately 80 to 85 of our casino revenue is generated from slot play. The majority of our revenue is cash-based and as a result, fluctuations in our revenues have a direct impact on our cash flows from operations. Because our business is capital intensive, we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing and fund capital expenditures. 
 A significant portion of our business is dependent upon customers who live and/or work in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. In September 2024, the unemployment rate in the Las Vegas metropolitan area was 5.9 as compared to 5.7 in September 2023. Statewide, the unemployment rate for September 2024 was 5.6 as compared to 5.4 in September 2023. In September 2024, the median price of an existing single-family home in Las Vegas according to the Las Vegas Realtors was 479,900, up 6.6 from 450,000 in September 2023. In light of uncertainty in the economic outlook stemming from inflation, higher interest rates, increased energy costs and increased geo-political and regional conflicts, we cannot predict whether the trend in unemployment or the trend in housing prices in the Las Vegas area will continue. 
 We have continued to experience favorable customer trends, including consistent visitation from our guests and strong spend per visit across the majority of our properties. These trends, in combination with our operational discipline and our focus on our core local guests, as well as regional and out of town guests, continued to drive strong operating results in 2024. However, we cannot predict whether these trends will continue, nor can we predict the extent to which impacts of inflation, increased energy costs and interest rate fluctuations may affect our business in the future. 
 Information about our results of operations is included herein and in the notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key Performance Indicators 
 We use certain key indicators to measure our performance. 
 Gaming revenue measures: 
 Slot handle, table game drop and race and sports write are measures of volume. Slot handle represents the dollar amount wagered in slot machines, and table game drop represents the total amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in table game drop boxes. 
 Win represents the amount of wagers retained by us. 
 Hold represents win as a percentage of slot handle, table game drop or race and sports write. 
 As our customers are primarily Las Vegas residents, our hold percentages are generally consistent from period to period. Fluctuations in our casino revenue are primarily due to the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties. 
 Food and beverage revenue measures: 
 Average guest check is a measure of food sales volume and product offerings at our restaurants, and represents the average amount spent per customer visit. 
 Number of guests served is an indicator of volume. 
 Room revenue measures: 
 Occupancy is calculated by dividing occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by rooms available. 
 Average daily rate ADR is calculated by dividing room revenue, which includes the retail value of complimentary rooms, by rooms occupied, including complimentary rooms. 
 Revenue per available room is calculated by dividing room revenue by rooms available.

 We view each of our Las Vegas casino properties as an individual operating segment. We aggregate all of our Las Vegas operating segments into one reportable segment because all of our Las Vegas properties offer similar products, cater to the same customer base, have the same regulatory and tax structure, share the same marketing programs, are directed by a centralized management structure and have similar economic characteristics. We also aggregate our Native American management arrangements into one reportable segment. There was no Native American management activity in the current or prior year periods. The results of operations for our Las Vegas operations are discussed in the remaining sections below.

The increases in SG A expenses were primarily due to expenses associated with our Durango property. As a percentage of net revenues, SG A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were in-line with the prior year periods. Management continues to focus on operational discipline and opportunities for improved efficiency. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense increased by 45.6 and 44.2 , respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to depreciation expense associated with Durango s assets placed in service in December 2023. 
 Write-downs and Other, net. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, write-downs and other, net included 5.8 million in refunds for previously expensed development costs and 3.2 million in net costs primarily comprising development and preopening expenses and business innovation development expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, write-downs and other, net totaled 1.7 million, primarily comprising development and preopening expenses (including 5.8 million in refunds for previously expensed development costs) and business innovation development expenses.

The increase in interest expense was primarily due to capitalized interest in the prior year periods, as well as an increase in borrowings for the current year periods. We expect that the variable interest rates on our credit facility may continue to fluctuate in response to macroeconomic conditions. On March 14, 2024, we completed a series of refinancing transactions pursuant to which we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement and issued 500 million of 6.625 senior notes due 2032 (the 6.625 Senior Notes ).

See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the refinancing transactions as well as our other long-term debt. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Instruments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net losses of 9.7 million and 11.7 million, respectively, in the fair value of our interest rate collars. The losses were primarily due to downward movements in the forward interest rate curve. 
 Provision for Income Tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a provision for income tax of 8.1 million and 26.1 million, respectively. Station Holdco is treated as a partnership for income tax reporting purposes and Station Holdco s members are liable for federal, state and local income taxes based on their share of Station Holdco s taxable income. We are not liable for income tax on the noncontrolling interests share of Station Holdco s taxable income or benefit from a taxable loss, and therefore our effective tax rate of 12.7 and 11.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were less than the statutory rate. We recognized income tax expense of 9.3 million and 27.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 represented the portion of net income attributable to the ownership interest in Station Holdco not held by us.

 The year-over-year changes in Adjusted EBITDA were due to the factors described within Results of Operations above. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely used measure of operating performance in our industry and is a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies. We believe that in addition to net income, Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing our operating performance because it provides information about the performance of our ongoing core operations. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes net income plus depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, write-downs and other, net (including gains and losses on asset disposals, preopening and development, business innovation and technology enhancements, demolition costs and non-routine items), interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment/modification of debt, change in fair value of derivative instruments and provision for income tax. 
 To evaluate Adjusted EBITDA and the trends it depicts, the components should be considered. Each of these components can significantly affect our results of operations and should be considered in evaluating our operating performance, and the impact of these components cannot be determined from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA does not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. It should be noted that not all gaming companies that report EBITDA or adjustments to this measure may calculate EBITDA or such adjustments in the same manner as we do, and therefore, our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other gaming companies.

Holding Company Financial Information 
 The indentures governing the 4.50 Senior Notes, 4.625 Senior Notes and 6.625 Senior Notes contain certain covenants that require Station LLC to furnish to the holders of the notes certain annual and quarterly financial information relating to Station LLC and its subsidiaries. The obligation to furnish such information may be satisfied by providing consolidated financial information of the Company along with additional disclosure explaining the differences between such information and the financial information of Station LLC and its subsidiaries on a standalone basis. The following financial information about the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, exclusive of Station LLC and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company ), is furnished to explain the differences between the financial information of the Holding Company and the financial information of Station LLC and its subsidiaries for the periods presented in this report. The primary differences between the financial information of the Holding Company and that of Station LLC relate to income taxes, the liability associated with the tax receivable agreement TRA and a note receivable from Station LLC. 
 At September 30, 2024, the difference between the balance sheet for Station LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and the balance sheet for the Holding Company is that the Holding Company had cash of 3.0 million, 6.7 million of income tax receivable, 48.6 million of deferred tax assets, net, and a 53.2 million note receivable from Station LLC, which are solely assets of the Holding Company, and liabilities that are solely the Holding Company s, consisting of a 20.4 million liability under the TRA, of which 1.2 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months and 4.0 million of other liabilities. The Holding Company s 53.2 million intercompany note receivable from Station LLC is eliminated in consolidation. At December 31, 2023, the Holding Company had cash of 0.2 million, 14.4 million of income tax receivable, 43.4 million of deferred tax assets, net, and a 34.0 million note receivable from Station LLC, which are solely assets of the Holding Company, and liabilities that are solely the Holding Company s, consisting of a 22.1 million liability under the TRA, of which 1.7 million was current, and 3.3 million of other liabilities. 
 The Holding Company recognized net losses of 7.5 million and 24.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 8.9 million and 27.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to the provision for income taxes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following financial condition, capital resources and liquidity discussion contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to our business, financial condition, results of operations, dispositions, acquisitions, expansion projects and issuances of debt and equity, which involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied herein. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 117.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Station LLC maintains its borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility, subject to continued compliance with the terms of the credit facility. At September 30, 2024, Station LLC s borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was 869.2 million, which was net of 185.0 million in outstanding borrowings and 45.8 million in outstanding letters of credit and similar obligations. 
 On March 14, 2024, Station LLC entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which amended and restated the existing credit agreement and pursuant to which Station LLC repaid all loans outstanding under the existing credit agreement and (a) incurred (i) a new senior secured term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1,570.0 million (the New Term B Facility and the term B loans funded thereunder, the New Term B Loan and (ii) a new senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1,100.0 million (the New Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the New Term B Facility, the New Credit Facilities ), and (b) made certain other amendments to the existing credit agreement, including the extinguishment of the existing term loan A facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature on March 14, 2029 and the New Term B Facility will mature on March 14, 2031. Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, equal to either the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate term Term SOFR or a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (ii) the administrative agent s prime rate and (iii) the one-month Term SOFR rate plus 1.00 , in each case plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is, in the case of the New Term B Loan, 2.25 per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan and 1.25 in the case of any base rate loan. 
 In April 2024, we entered into two zero cost interest rate collars to manage our exposure to interest rate movements associated with our variable interest rate debt. The interest rate collars, which have a total notional amount of 750.0 million, include a Term SOFR cap of 5.25 and a weighted average Term SOFR floor of 2.89 . The interest rate collars became

effective in April 2024 and will mature in April 2029. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our derivative instruments. 
 In addition, on March 14, 2024, we issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625 Senior Notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 14, 2024, among Station LLC, the guarantors party thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The net proceeds of the sale of the 6.625 Senior Notes together with the borrowings under the New Term B Loan were used (i) to refinance all loans and commitments outstanding under the existing credit agreement, (ii) to pay fees and costs associated with such transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 6.625 Senior Notes will be paid every six months in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing on September 15, 2024. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our long-term debt. 
 Our primary capital requirements for the near term are expected to be related to the operation and maintenance of our properties, debt service payments, dividends and distributions. Our anticipated uses of cash for the remainder of 2024 include (i) approximately 20 million to 40 million for capital expenditures, (ii) approximately 20 million for construction advances on the North Fork project, (iii)required principal and interest payments on Station LLC s indebtedness totaling 4.3 million and 54.3 million, respectively, (iv) dividends to our Class A common stockholders, including approximately 14.9 million to be paid in December 2024, and (v) distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of Station Holdco, including approximately 11.5 million to be paid in September 2024 and including tax distributions that may be made quarterly when required and in amounts that may vary from quarter to quarter. Other payment obligations include salaries, wages and employee benefits, service contracts, property taxes, insurance and other obligations. 
 On May 2, 2024, our board of directors extended the expiration date of the equity repurchase program to December 31, 2025. Our board of directors has authorized 600.0 million for repurchases of Class A common stock under our equity repurchase program. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares under the program. Subject to applicable laws and the provisions of any agreements restricting our ability to do so, repurchases may be made at our discretion from time to time through open market purchases, negotiated transactions or tender offers, depending on market conditions and other factors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 75,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions at a weighted-average price of 52.29 per share. At September 30, 2024, we had 309.0 million of remaining repurchases authorized under the program. From time to time, we may also seek to repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. Any such purchases may be funded by existing cash balances or the incurrence of debt, including borrowings under our credit facility. The amount and timing of any repurchases will be based on business and market conditions, capital availability, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. 
 We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months. We regularly assess our projected cash requirements for capital expenditures, repayment of debt obligations, and payment of other general corporate and operational needs. In the long term, we expect that we will fund our capital requirements with a combination of cash generated from operations, borrowings under the credit facility and the issuance of debt or equity as market conditions may permit. However, our cash flow and ability to obtain debt or equity financing on terms that are satisfactory to us, or at all, may be affected by a variety of factors, including competition, general economic and business conditions and financial markets. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will generate sufficient income and liquidity to meet all of our liquidity requirements or other obligations. 
 Following is a summary of our cash flow information (amounts in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 400,038 335,401 Investing activities (286,002) (520,537) Financing activities (134,126) 190,682 
 Cash Flows from Operations 
 Our operating cash flows primarily consist of operating income or loss generated by our properties (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest and income tax payments, and changes in working capital accounts such as inventories, prepaid expenses, receivables and payables. The majority of our revenue is generated from our slot machine and

table game play, which is conducted primarily on a cash basis. Our food and beverage, room and other revenues are also primarily cash-based. As a result, fluctuations in our revenues have a direct impact on our cash flow from operations. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 400.0 million as compared to 335.4 million for the prior year period. Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 169.0 million and 126.3 million in interest payments, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also paid 11.4 million in fees and costs related to debt modification. In addition, our operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the prior year period due to changes in working capital accounts. Information about our operating activities is presented within Results of Operations above. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash paid for capital expenditures totaled 257.0 million and 512.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related to the Durango project. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 As described above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Station LLC entered into an amended and restated credit agreement pursuant to which it repaid all loans outstanding under the existing credit agreement, borrowed 1,570.0 million under the New Term B Facility and borrowed 280.0 million under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Station LLC also issued 500.0 million in principal amount of 6.625 Senior Notes due 2032 and paid 23.5 million in debt issuance costs. In addition, we paid 103.6 million in dividends to Class A common stockholders and 110.4 million in cash distributions to the noncontrolling interest holders of Station Holdco. We also paid 13.8 million related to tax withholding on share-based compensation during the period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 370.5 million under the existing revolving credit facility, and paid 44.0 million in dividends to Class A common stockholders and 65.2 million in cash distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of Station Holdco. We also paid 9.5 million related to tax withholding on share-based compensation. 
 Restrictive Covenants 
 The agreements governing our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including certain limitations on our and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. The financial ratio covenants contained in the recent amendments to the Credit Agreement include a maximum Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of 5.00 to 1.00. We believe that as of September 30, 2024, Station LLC was in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes. 
 As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to provide liquidity if changes in the economy, discretionary spending, consumer confidence or other external factors negatively affect our business. In addition, such covenants and restrictions may limit our ability to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Further, our ability to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and industry conditions. 
 Failure to satisfy the covenants contained in the credit agreements, indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness would require us to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain required waivers or amendments, as such matters depend, in part, on factors outside of our control. If we fail to satisfy our covenants and are unable to obtain such waivers or amendments, our creditors could exercise remedies under the applicable documents governing such indebtedness, including acceleration of such indebtedness. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us, nor did we have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit and similar obligations totaling 45.8 million.

Inflation 
 Our business continues to experience the impact of inflation and higher interest rates and we expect the impact to continue through the remainder of 2024. Commodity prices have increased and become more volatile, and we continue to experience price inflation in ordinary goods and services such as food costs, supplies, energy costs and construction costs. In addition, we have been impacted by a shortage of qualified workers which places additional upward pressure on wages and benefit costs as we seek to attract and retain qualified workers. We attempt to minimize the impact of inflation on our business by implementing cost controls, adjusting prices and optimizing our procurement strategy. 
 Native American Development 
 We have development and management agreements with the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians, a federally recognized Native American tribe located near Fresno, California, pursuant to which we will assist the tribe in developing, financing and operating a gaming and entertainment facility to be located on Highway 99 north of the city of Madera, California. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about this project. 
 Regulation and Taxes 
 We are subject to extensive regulation by Nevada gaming authorities as well as the National Indian Gaming Commission and the California Gambling Control Commission. In addition, we will be subject to regulation, which may or may not be similar to that in Nevada, by any other jurisdiction in which we may conduct gaming activities in the future. 
 The gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law, or in the administration of such law, affecting the gaming industry. The Nevada legislature meets every two years for 120 days and when special sessions are called by the Governor. The most recent special legislative session ended on June 14, 2023. There are currently no specific legislative proposals to increase taxes on gaming revenue, but there are no assurances that an increase in taxes on gaming or other revenue will not be proposed and passed by the Nevada legislature in the future. 
 Description of Certain Indebtedness 
 A description of our indebtedness is included in Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Material changes to the terms of our indebtedness during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are described therein and include a description of the March 2024 amendment to Station LLC s credit facility and the issuance of 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625 Senior Notes due 2032. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A description of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Forward-looking Statements 
 When used in this report and elsewhere by management from time to time, the words may, might, could, believes, anticipates, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements with respect to our financial condition, results of operations and our business including our expansions, development and acquisition projects, legal proceedings and employee matters. Certain important factors, including but not limited to, financial market risks, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Potential factors which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and business include, without limitation, the impact of rising inflation, higher interest rates and increased energy costs on consumer demand and our business and results of operations, financial results and liquidity; the impact of our substantial indebtedness; the effects of local and national economic, credit and capital market conditions on consumer spending and the economy in general, and on the gaming and hotel industries in particular; the effects of competition, including locations of competitors and operating and market competition; changes in laws, including increased tax rates, regulations or accounting standards, third-party relations and approvals, and decisions of courts, regulators and governmental bodies; risks associated with construction projects, including disruption of our operations, shortages of materials or labor, unexpected costs, unforeseen permitting or regulatory issues and weather; litigation outcomes and judicial actions, including gaming legislative action, referenda and taxation; acts of war or terrorist incidents, pandemics, natural disasters or civil unrest; risks associated with the collection and retention of data about our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners; and other risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking

statements are based on our current expectations and projections about future events. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt. In April 2024, we entered into two zero cost interest rate collars to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. There have been no material changes in our market risks from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits relating to routine matters incidental to their business. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such matters and litigation inherently involves significant risks. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures None. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 Pursuant to Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, none of the Company's directors or executive officers adopted, terminated or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
