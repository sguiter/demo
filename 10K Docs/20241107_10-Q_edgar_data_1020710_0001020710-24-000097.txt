During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million in other current and other long-term liabilities for contingent consideration associated with the recent acquisitions. 
 
 Acquisitions Note 12 
 Settlements ) Total remeasurement adjustments: Changes in fair value recorded in other expense (income), net 
 Ending Balance at September 30, 2024 Amounts included in other current liabilities were million and million for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Amounts included in other long-term liabilities were million and million for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs 
 
 The significant Level 3 unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration related to the acquisitions are annualized EBITDA forecasts developed by the Company's management and the probability of achievement of those EBITDA results. The discount rate used in the calculations was percent. Changes in our unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a change to our fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of contingent consideration payable under these arrangements is million over . 
 
 Other financial instruments not measured at fair value on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, but which require disclosure of their fair values include: cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses. The Company believes that the estimated fair value of such instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximates their carrying value as reported on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the relative short maturity of these instruments. 
 
 See Note 8 - Long-term Debt for fair value disclosures on our asset-backed line of credit and term loan debt under our syndicated credit agreement facilities.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million of the balances that were previously classified as contract liabilities at the beginning of the period were recognized in revenues, respectively. Contract asset and liability changes were primarily due to normal activity and timing differences between our performance and customer payments.

percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a tax expense of percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was decreased by research and development tax credits and other tax credits and partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses, contingent consideration payments, and uncertain tax positions recorded for research and development tax credits. 
 
 Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was a tax expense of percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a tax expense of percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was decreased by research and development tax credits and other tax credits and partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses, contingent consideration payments, and uncertain tax positions recorded for research and development tax credits. 
 
 To the extent penalties and interest would be assessed on any underpayment of income tax, such accrued amounts would be classified as a component of income tax provision (benefit) in the financial statements consistent with the Company s policy. 
 
 The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to release additional guidance, including administrative guidance on how Pillar Two rules should be interpreted and applied by jurisdictions as they adopt Pillar Two. A number of countries have utilized the administrative guidance as a starting point for legislation that went into effect January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, DXP anticipates the impact of Pillar Two to be immaterial to the Company based on current legislation that has been enacted to date.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following management discussion and analysis ("MD A") of the financial condition and results of operations of DXP Enterprises, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (collectively "DXP," "Company," "us," "we," or "our") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 should be read in conjunction with our previous Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in such reports. The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Report") contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These forward-looking statements include without limitation those about the Company s expectations regarding the Company s business, the Company s future profitability, cash flow, liquidity, and growth. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes", "expects", "may", "might", "estimates", "will", "should", "could", "would", "suspect", "potential", "current", "achieve", "plans" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. Any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements or historical performance as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the effectiveness of management's strategies and decisions; our ability to implement our internal growth and acquisition growth strategies; general economic and business conditions specific to our primary customers; changes in government regulations; our ability to effectively integrate businesses we may acquire; new or modified statutory or regulatory requirements; availability of materials and labor; inability to obtain or delay in obtaining government or third-party approvals and permits; non-performance by third parties of their contractual obligations; unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto; cyber-attacks adversely affecting our operations; other geological, operating and economic considerations and declining prices and market conditions, including reduced oil and gas prices and supply or demand for maintenance, repair and operating products, equipment and service; decreases in oil and natural gas industry capital expenditure levels, which may result from decreased oil and natural gas prices or other factors; our ability to manage changes and the continued health or availability of management personnel; and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or amend our credit facilities, as needed. This Report identifies other factors that could cause such differences. We cannot assure that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Risk Factors", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 11, 2024. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Report to the "Company", "DXP", "we" or "our" shall mean DXP Enterprises, Inc., a Texas corporation, together with its subsidiaries. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by U.S. GAAP, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are organic sales ("Organic Sales"), sales per business day ("Sales per Business Day"), organic sales per business day ("Organic Sales per Business Day"), free cash flow ("Free Cash Flow"), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") adjusted EBITDA ("Adjusted EBITDA"), EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 
 17 

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. 
 
 Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation section below for detailed reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures.

 We define and calculate organic sales to include locations and acquisitions under our ownership for at least twelve months. "Acquisition Sales" are sales from acquisitions that have been under our ownership for less than twelve months and are excluded in our calculation of Organic Sales. 
 
 Business Days 
 
 "Business Days" are days of the week, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, that our locations are open during the year. Depending on the location and the season, our branches may be open on Saturdays and Sundays; however, for consistency, those days have been excluded from the calculation of Business Days. 
 
 Sales per Business Day 
 
 We define and calculate Sales per Business Day as sales divided by the number of Business Days in the relevant reporting period. 
 
 Organic Sales per Business Days 
 
 We define and calculate Organic Sales per Business Day as Organic Sales divided by the number of Business Days in the relevant reporting period. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We define and calculate EBITDA as Net income attributable to DXP Enterprises, Inc., plus interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA as Net income attributable to DXP Enterprises, Inc., plus interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization minus stock-based compensation expense and all other non-cash charges, adjustments, and non-recurring items. We identify the impact of all other non-cash charges, adjustments and non-recurring items because we believe these items do not directly reflect our underlying operations. 
 
 EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 We define and calculate EBITDA Margin as EBITDA divided by sales. We define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 We define and calculate free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment. 

Matters Affecting Comparability 
 
 There were 64 business days during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 63 business days during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 
 Service Centers and Innovative Pumping Solutions Segments 
 
 The replacement and mission-critical nature of our products and services within the Company's Service Centers and Innovative Pumping Solutions business segments and industrial and manufacturing environments and processes drives a demand and outlook that are correlated with global, national and regional industrial production, capacity utilization and long-term GDP growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1,137.2 million in sales in our Service Centers and Innovative Pumping Solutions segments, an increase of approximately 6.0 percent compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our performance has been strengthened by price increases from our vendors and suppliers and the Company's acquisition activity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 40.5 million was associated with recent acquisitions in the water and wastewater markets. We are encouraged by the tapering effects of inflation and believe as we move forward, demand should be consistent across all the end markets we provide products and service. 
 
 19 

Supply Chain Services Segment 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had approximately 193.9 million in sales in our Supply Chain Services segment, a decrease of approximately 2.6 percent compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily due to some facility closures with some of our customers as well as the inherent efficiencies we bring to customers as part of our value proposition. As we move forward and given our increasing demand, we expect our performance to be driven by either the addition of new customers or an increase in spend by our existing customers.

Service Centers segment. Sales for the SC segment increased 22.4 million, or 7.6 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year's corresponding period. This sales increase is primarily the result of the timing of jobs and business mix, as well as 13.0 million associated with recent acquisition. 
 
 21 

Innovative Pumping Solutions segment. Sales for the IPS segment increased 30.9 million, or 52.3 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year's corresponding period. This sales increase is primarily the result of the timing of jobs, increased project related work, and 15.6 million was associated with recent acquisitions in the water and wastewater markets. 
 
 Supply Chain Services segment. Sales for the SCS segment increased by 0.5 million, or 0.7 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year's corresponding period. The increase in sales was primarily the result of increased business activity.

 OPERATING INCOME. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 3.8 million to 39.6 million, from 35.9 million in the prior year's corresponding period. This increase in operating income was driven by the increase in sales during the period. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3.0 million compared to the prior year's corresponding period. This increase was primarily due to the Company borrowing an additional 125.0 million on its Term Loan during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 INCOME TAXES. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was a tax expense of 11.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a tax expense of 26.3 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was decreased by research and development tax credits and other tax credits and partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses, contingent consideration payments, and uncertain tax positions recorded for research and development tax credits.

Service Centers segment. Sales for the SC segment decreased by 2.3 million, or 0.3 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year's corresponding period. Sales from acquisitions for the SC segment increased 4.1 million compared to the corresponding period. Total sales for the SC segment excluding acquisitions decreased 6.4 million from the prior year's corresponding period. This sales decrease is primarily the result of timing and business mix within the segment. 
 
 Innovative Pumping Solutions segment . Sales for the IPS segment increased by 67.0 million, or 42.3 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year's corresponding period. Sales from acquisitions for the IPS segment increased 29.4 million compared to the corresponding period. Total sales for the IPS segment excluding acquisitions increased 37.6 million from the prior year's corresponding period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in project related jobs due to increased capital spending by oil and gas producers and renewables sector. 
 
 Supply Chain Services segment. Sales for the SCS segment decreased by 5.1 million, or 2.6 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year's corresponding period. The decrease in sales was primarily the result of customer facilities closing where we operated.

 OPERATING INCOME. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.6 million or 2.4 to 106.1 million from 108.7 million in the prior year's corresponding period. This decrease in operating income is primarily related to the aforementioned increase in SG A. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.6 million compared with the prior year's corresponding period. This increase was primarily due to the Company borrowing an additional 125.0 million on its Term Loan during the fourth quarter of 2023 and incurring higher than average interest rates on such debt due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and the associated increasing interest rate policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
 INCOME TAXES. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was a tax expense of 21.1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a tax expense of 26.8 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was decreased by research and development tax credits and other tax credits and partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses, contingent consideration payments, and uncertain tax positions recorded for research and development tax credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 General Overview 
 
 On October 3, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the Third Term Loan Amendment on its existing Senior Secured Term Loan B, repricing and borrowing an incremental 105 million that was added to the existing Senior Secured Term Loan B. Including the new borrowings, the Company will have 649.5 million in Senior Secured Term Loan B borrowings. The new Senior Secured Term Loan B borrowings mature on October 13, 2030, and are priced at Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 3.75 percent. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had available cash of 35.0 million and credit facility availability of 131.6 million. We have a 135.0 million asset-backed line of credit (the "ABL Revolver"), partially offset by letters of credit of 3.4 million. We had no borrowings outstanding on our ABL Revolver as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our primary source of capital is cash flow from operations, supplemented as necessary by bank borrowings or other sources of financing. As a distributor of MRO products and services and fabricator of custom pumps and packages, working capital can fluctuate as a result of changes in inventory levels, accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings for project work. Additional cash is required for capital items for information technology, warehouse equipment, leasehold improvements, pump manufacturing and safety services equipment. We also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt. 
 
 The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods presented (in thousands) : 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used in): Operating Activities 70,068 63,775 Investing Activities (165,113) (15,951) Financing Activities (42,384) (66,744) Effect of Foreign Currency (691) 70 Net Change in Cash (138,120) (18,850) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 The Company generated 70.1 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 63.8 million of cash generated during the prior year's corresponding period. 
 
 25 

Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 165.1 million compared to a 16.0 million use of cash during the prior year s corresponding period. This 149.2 million increase was primarily driven by acquisition activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was 149.4 million compared to 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is also driven by purchases of property and equipment of 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 42.4 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 66.7 million during the prior year s corresponding period. The decrease was primarily due to share repurchases of 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 56.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company also paid contingent consideration of 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financial Covenants: 
 
 The Company's principal financial covenants under the ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan B Agreement include: 
 
 Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under the ABL Credit Agreement is defined as the ratio for the most recently completed four-fiscal quarter period, of (a) EBITDA minus capital expenditures (excluding (i) those financed or funded with debt (other than the ABL Loans), (ii) the portion thereof funded with the net proceeds from asset dispositions of equipment or real property which the Company is permitted to reinvest pursuant to the Term Loan and (iii) the portion thereof funded with the net proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards in respect of any equipment and real estate which DXP is not required to use to prepay the ABL Loans pursuant to the Term Loan B Agreement or with the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards in respect of any other property) minus cash taxes paid (net of cash tax refunds received during such period), to (b) fixed charges. The Company is restricted from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to be less than 1.00 to 1.00 during a compliance period, which is triggered when the availability under the ABL Revolver falls below a threshold set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was 1.72 to 1.00. 
 
 26 

Secured Leverage Ratio The Term Loan B Agreement requires that the Company s Secured Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of consolidated secured debt (net of unrestricted cash, not to exceed 200 million) as of such day to EBITDA, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, is either equal to or less than as indicated in the table below: 
 
 Fiscal Quarter Secured Leverage Ratio September 30, 2024 5.50:1.00 
 December 31, 2024 5.50:1.00 
 March 31, 2025 5.25:1.00 
 June 30, 2025 5.25:1.00 
 September 30, 2025 5.25:1.00 
 December 31, 2025 5.00:1.00 
 March 31, 2026 5.00:1.00 
 June 30, 2026 4.75:1.00 
 September 30, 2026 4.75:1.00 December 31, 2026 and thereafter 4.75:1.00 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Secured Leverage Ratio was 2.54 to 1.00. 
 
 EBITDA as defined under the Term Loan B Agreement for financial covenant purposes means, without duplication, for any period of determination, the sum of, consolidated net income during such period; plus to the extent deducted from consolidated net income in such period: (i) income tax expense, (ii) franchise tax expense, (iii) interest expense, (iv) amortization and depreciation during such period, (v) all non-cash charges and adjustments, and (vi) non-recurring cash expenses related to the Term Loan, provided, that if the Company acquires or disposes of any property during such period (other than under certain exceptions specified in the Term Loan B Agreement, including the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business), then EBITDA shall be calculated, after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or disposition, as if such acquisition or disposition had occurred on the first day of such period. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Funding Commitments 
 
 We intend to pursue additional acquisition targets, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition and the related potential capital commitments cannot be determined with certainty. We continue to expect to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash flows from operations and borrowings, including the undrawn portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to the Company. 
 
 The Company believes it has adequate funding and liquidity to meet its normal working capital needs during the next twelve months. However, the Company may require additional debt outside of our credit facilities or equity financing to fund potential acquisitions. Such additional financings may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of debt or equity securities. In connection with any such financing, the Company may issue securities that dilute the interests of our shareholders. 
 
 DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS POLICIES 
 
 Critical accounting and business policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial position and results of operations, and require management's subjective or complex judgments. These policies have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of DXP. 
 
 The Company's unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis as our annual Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a more complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and business practices, refer to the consolidated Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full fiscal year.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 See Note 3 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 
 28 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 With the participation of management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer carried out an evaluation, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with GAAP for each of the periods presented. 
 
 Remediation of Previously Disclosed Material Weaknesses 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management remediated a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition. The necessary controls have been designed, implemented, and tested for operating effectiveness and these controls have been operated for a sufficient period of time as of September 30, 2024 which allows for management to conclude this material weakness is now remediated. 
 
 Additionally, in relation to the material weakness in our control environment, and as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2024, the remediation of this material weakness was dependent on additional time to remediate the remaining material weakness. Given the remediation of the material weakness related to revenue recognition as disclosed above, we now conclude that this material weakness is now remediated. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act identified in the evaluation for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION
