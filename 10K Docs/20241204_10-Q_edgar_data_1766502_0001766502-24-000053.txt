 Vested equity warrants and equity investments in public companies that have readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value and are classified as marketable securities within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted market prices. 
 
 Unvested equity warrants are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on observable and unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. The Company utilized certain valuation techniques, such as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model, to determine the fair value of unvested equity warrants. The application of these models requires the use of a number of complex assumptions based on unobservable inputs, including the expected term, expected equity volatility, discounts for lack of marketability, cash flow projections, and probability with respect to vesting requirements. Equity warrants are transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy upon vesting as they are no longer valued based on unobservable inputs.

Key Financial and Operating Data 
 
 We measure our business using both financial and operating data and use the following metrics and measures to assess the near-term and long-term performance of our overall business, including identifying trends, formulating financial projections, making strategic decisions, assessing operational efficiencies, and monitoring our business.

 (2) Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. 

We define net margin as net income divided by net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed here and elsewhere in this 10-Q Report adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income excluding depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense and related taxes; income tax provision (benefit); interest income (expense), net; transaction related costs; changes in the fair value of equity warrants; severance and exit costs; and litigation matters and other items that we do not consider representative of our underlying operations. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 
 We have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in this 10-Q Report because each is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. 
 20 

We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense from our adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude income tax provision (benefit); interest income (expense), net; transaction related costs; changes in the fair value of equity warrants; and litigation matters and other items which are not components of our core business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude severance and exit costs because these expenses represent temporary initiatives to realign resources and enhance operational efficiency, which are not components of our core business operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation and related taxes. Share-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), net; or changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect transaction related costs and other items which are either not representative of our underlying operations or are incremental costs that result from an actual or planned transaction or initiative and include changes in the fair value of equity warrants, severance and exit costs, litigation matters, integration consulting fees, internal salaries and wages (to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT systems; and 
 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income, net margin, and our other GAAP results.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share 
 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed here and elsewhere in this 10-Q Report adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, which represent non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expense and related taxes, changes in valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets, changes in the fair value of equity warrants, and severance and exit costs. We calculate adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share by dividing adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 
 We have included adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share in this 10-Q Report because each is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and certain variable gains and losses that do not represent a component of our core business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude changes in valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets as this is not a component of our core business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude changes in the fair value of equity warrants because the variability of equity warrant gains and losses is not representative of our underlying operations. We believe it is useful to exclude severance and exit costs because these expenses represent temporary initiatives to realign resources and enhance operational efficiency, which are not components of our core business operations. Accordingly, we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. 
 
 Adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share have limitations as financial measures and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

22 

Free Cash Flow 
 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have also disclosed here and elsewhere in this 10-Q Report free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which consist of purchases of property and equipment, capitalization of labor related to our websites, mobile applications, software development, and leasehold improvements). We have provided a reconciliation below of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 
 We have included free cash flow in this 10-Q Report because it is used by our management and board of directors as an important indicator of our liquidity as it measures the amount of cash we generate. Accordingly, we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. 
 
 Free cash flow has limitations as a financial measure and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including that other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate free cash flow differently. Because of these limitations, you should consider free cash flow alongside other financial performance measures, including net cash provided by operating activities, capital expenditures and our other GAAP results. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for each of the periods indicated: 
 
 (in thousands) 13 Weeks Ended 39 Weeks Ended Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 183,462 79,377 388,809 386,664 Deduct: Capital expenditures (31,695) (31,685) (92,920) (110,902) Free Cash Flow 151,767 47,692 295,889 275,762 
 
 Free cash flow may be affected in the near to medium term by the timing of capital investments (such as the launch of new fulfillment centers, pharmacy facilities, veterinary clinics, customer service infrastructure, and corporate offices and purchases of IT and other equipment), fluctuations in our growth and the effect of such fluctuations on working capital, and changes in our cash conversion cycle due to increases or decreases of vendor payment terms as well as inventory turnover. 
 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 
 Active Customers 
 
 As of the last date of each reporting period, we determine our number of active customers by counting the total number of individual customers who have ordered a product or service, and for whom a product has shipped or for whom a service has been provided, at least once during the preceding 364-day period. The change in active customers in a reporting period captures both the inflow of new customers and the outflow of customers who have not made a purchase in the last 364 days. We view the number of active customers as a key indicator of our growth acquisition and retention of customers as a result of our marketing efforts and the value we provide to our customers. The number of active customers has grown over time as we acquired new customers and retained previously acquired customers. 
 
 Net Sales Per Active Customer 
 
 We define net sales per active customer as the aggregate net sales for the preceding four fiscal quarters, divided by the total number of active customers at the end of that period. We view net sales per active customer as a key indicator of our customers purchasing patterns, including their initial and repeat purchase behavior. 

23 

Autoship and Autoship Customer Sales 
 
 We define Autoship customers as customers in a given fiscal quarter that had an order shipped through our Autoship subscription program during the preceding 364-day period. We define Autoship as our subscription program, which provides automatic ordering, payment, and delivery of products to our customers. We view our Autoship subscription program as a key driver of recurring net sales and customer retention. For a given fiscal quarter, Autoship customer sales consist of sales and shipping revenues from all Autoship subscription program purchases and purchases outside of the Autoship subscription program by Autoship customers, excluding taxes collected from customers, excluding any refunds, and net of any promotional offers (such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers) for that quarter. For a given fiscal year, Autoship customer sales equal the sum of the Autoship customer sales for each of the fiscal quarters in that fiscal year. 
 
 Autoship Customer Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales 
 
 We define Autoship customer sales as a percentage of net sales as the Autoship customer sales in a given reporting period divided by the net sales from all orders in that period. We view Autoship customer sales as a percentage of net sales as a key indicator of our recurring sales and customer retention. 

Components of Results of Consolidated Operations 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 We derive net sales primarily from sales of both third-party brand and private brand pet food, pet products, pet medications and other pet health products, and related shipping fees. Sales of third-party brand and private brand pet food, pet products and shipping revenues are recorded when products are shipped, net of promotional discounts and refunds and allowances. Taxes collected from customers are excluded from net sales. Net sales is primarily driven by growth of new customers and active customers, and the frequency with which customers purchase and subscribe to our Autoship subscription program. 
 
 We also periodically provide promotional offers, including discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers. These offers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are reflected as a net amount in net sales. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of third-party brand and private brand products sold to customers, inventory freight, shipping supply costs, inventory shrinkage costs, and inventory valuation adjustments, offset by reductions for promotions and percentage or volume rebates offered by our vendors, which may depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. Generally, amounts received from vendors are considered a reduction of the carrying value of inventory and are ultimately reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in general corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal and human resources; costs associated with use by these functions, such as depreciation expense and rent relating to facilities and equipment; professional fees and other general corporate costs; share-based compensation; and fulfillment costs. 
 
 Fulfillment costs represent costs incurred in operating and staffing fulfillment and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories, picking, packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment, payment processing and related transaction costs, and responding to inquiries from customers. Included within fulfillment costs are merchant processing fees charged by third parties that provide merchant processing services for credit cards. 
 
 Advertising and Marketing 
 
 Advertising and marketing expenses consist of advertising and payroll related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, business development and selling activities. 

24 

Interest Income (Expense), net 
 
 We generate interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We incur interest expense in relation to our borrowing facilities, finance leases, and uncertain tax positions. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 
 Our other income (expense), net consists of changes in the fair value of equity warrants, investments, and tax indemnification receivables, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and allowances for credit losses.

This increase was primarily driven by growth in customer spending from both new and existing customers, and the frequency with which customers purchase and subscribe to our Autoship subscription program.

 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the thirteen weeks ended October 27, 2024 increased by 69.7 million, or 3.6 , to 2.0 billion compared to 2.0 billion in the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in associated product, outbound freight, and shipping supply costs. The increase in cost of goods sold was lower than the increase in net sales on a percentage basis, reflecting supply chain efficiency gains across our fulfillment network. 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 increased by 113.9 million, or 1.9 , to 6.1 billion compared to 6.0 billion in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2023.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the thirteen weeks ended October 27, 2024 increased by 80 basis points compared to the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2023, primarily due to supply chain efficiency gains across our network as well as margin expansion across our consumables, healthcare, and private brands businesses.

This was primarily due to an increase of 14.6 million in non-cash share-based compensation expense and related taxes, partially offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in fulfillment costs attributable to automation and supply chain efficiencies within our fulfillment network, while facilities expenses and other general and administrative expenses remained consistent.

 We have recently undertaken a project that will modernize our finance information technology architecture. At the conclusion of this project, which we believe will occur towards the end of our 2025 fiscal year, we aim to have, among other things, (i) the ability to produce financial information across different segments of the Company, which supports scalability for future growth, (ii) expanded visibility and analytical capabilities with respect to our data, and (iii) an infrastructure that enables the use of artificial intelligence and other system advancements that will create further efficiencies for our team members. The project will not require meaningful capital investment. 
 
 Advertising and Marketing 
 
 Advertising and marketing expenses for the thirteen weeks ended October 27, 2024 increased by 12.6 million, or 7.0 , to 191.8 million compared to 179.2 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2023.

 Interest income for the thirteen weeks ended October 27, 2024 decreased by 6.3 million, to 3.9 million compared to interest income of 10.2 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2023. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest income generated by cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and an increase in interest expenses incurred. 
 
 Interest income for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 increased by 4.2 million, to 31.3 million compared to interest income of 27.1 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2023.

 Other income for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 27, 2024 increased by 14.5 million, to 0.7 million compared to other expense of 13.8 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in the fair value of equity warrants, tax indemnification receivables, and equity investments, partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We finance our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows generated by operations. Our principal sources of liquidity are expected to be our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of cash on deposit with banks. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 506.6 million as of October 27, 2024, a decrease of 95.6 million from January 28, 2024. Marketable securities consisted primarily of equity investments and totaled 0.9 million as of October 27, 2024, a decrease of 530.9 million from January 28, 2024. 
 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. In addition, we may choose to raise additional funds at any time through equity or debt financing arrangements, which may or may not be needed for additional working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or other strategic investments. Our opinions concerning liquidity are based on currently available information. To the extent this information proves to be inaccurate, or if circumstances change, future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity could be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 10-Q Report for the quarterly period ended April 28, 2024. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on terms favorable to us, or at all.

If Participant is employed by the Company in a research and development capacity and or if Participant is employed in a senior management position (such as Director, Senior Director, Vice President and above, Board Member, or Officer) then Participant is presumed to have participated in the Company s Business and or had Confidential Information about the Company s 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 Business throughout the United States (including state and state-equivalents and county and county-equivalents therein), as the Company and Participant agree that the Company s Business is e-commerce, is conducted nationwide and competes nationwide. 
 
 2. Worker Nonsolicit . Participant will not, directly or indirectly through providing assistance to others, knowingly participate in soliciting or communicating (verbally, electronically, or in other written form) with a Covered Worker for the purpose of persuading the Covered Worker to go to work for a Competitor or to end or modify the Covered Worker s relationship with the Company or assist a Competitor in efforts to hire a Covered Worker away from the Company.

 B-3. Avoidance of Unauthorized Confidential Information Use or Disclosure. 
 1. Participant will honor all agreements with the Company regarding maintaining the confidentiality of information that qualifies as contractually protected Confidential Information, protect and preserve the value of the Company s trade secrets and proprietary information to the Company (irrespective of whether same is also covered by contractual definition of Confidential Information), and comply with Company policies and directives regarding the handling of Company records, files, computer system access, materials and property at all times. To the extent Participant is not otherwise subject to another contractual agreement with the Company covering Confidential Information, Participant agrees that until such time as the Confidential Information is readily-available publicly (other than as a result of disclosure by Participant), Participant shall not disclose to any person or use, copy, download, upload or transfer any Confidential Information, whether or not created in 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 whole or in part by the efforts of Participant, and regardless of whether Participant is still employed by the Company. Participant will only disclose or use, copy, download, upload or transfer such Confidential Information as is required by law or as necessary in the performance of Participant s duties on behalf of the Company. 
 2. If Participant is subject to another contractual agreement that defines what constitutes the Company s Confidential Information , that definition shall control. Absent such a controlling definition, it is understood that Confidential Information refers to an item of information, or a compilation of information, in any form (tangible or intangible), related to the business of the Company that the Company has not made public or authorized public disclosure of, and that is not generally known to the public through proper means. Participant acknowledges that, in Participant s position with the Company, Participant will obtain and or have access to Confidential Information regarding the Company s business, including, but not limited to business plans and forecasts, market analysis, marketing plans and strategies, branding strategies, pricing-related variables and strategy, the actual and anticipated research and development activities of the Company, unpatented inventions, technical data, knowledge, information and materials about trade secrets, mailing e-mailing lists, methods of operation, customer or client lists, consumer preferences and buying histories, services, proprietary know-how, non-public information about financial performance, human resources information such as that obtained from a confidential personnel file, other proprietary matters relating to the Company, and information that is entrusted to the Company in confidence by third parties with whom the Company does business or is negotiating to do business, all of which constitute valuable assets of the Company which this Agreement is designed to protect. Nothing herein restricts or prevents an employee from sharing information about their own compensation with other employees nor prevents other employees from making inquiries about the compensation earned or paid to co-workers. 
 3. Participant agrees that, upon the termination of Participant s employment or services relationship with the Company for any reason whatsoever, Participant shall return all copies, in whatever form or media, including hard copies and electronic copies, of Confidential Information to the Company, and Participant shall delete any copy of the Confidential Information on any computer file or database maintained by Participant and, upon request by the Company, Participant shall certify in writing that this has process has been completed and no copies of Confidential Information are retained. 
 B-4. Avoidance of Disparagement. 
 Participant agrees to avoid making comments that are disparaging, false, misleading, defamatory or cast in a negative light the Company, or the Company s current or former directors, officers, or employees. And, Participant agrees not to, in any respect, make any disparaging or defamatory comments concerning any aspect of the Participant s relationship with the Company or any comments concerning the conduct or events which precipitated any termination of the Participant s employment from the Company. However, the Participant s obligations under this covenant shall not prevent Participant from exercising the right to (1) communicate with a law enforcement officer acting within the line and scope of the officer's law enforcement duties that a violation of the law has occurred or is occurring (2) communicate with a government regulator acting within 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 the line and scope of the regulator's regulatory duties that a violation of the law has occurred or is occurring (3) respond to a lawfully served judicial, grand jury, or other lawful subpoena (4) testify in a judicial or administrative proceeding in response to a lawfully served subpoena or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction (5) confer with the obligated party's attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or representation (6) respond to lawful discovery in a judicial or administrative action provided the disparaging statement is either ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or made in compliance with a protective order entered by the same court (7) prosecute or defend a civil action between or among parties to a covered contract provided the party making the disparaging statement attempts to and, if permitted by law, does file the disparaging statement and any related pleading under seal or in compliance with a protective order entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the civil action or (8) exercise federally protected statutory rights, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights under the National Labor Relations Act or the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. 
 B-5. Enforcement. 
 
 1. In the event the Company has reason to believe Participant has engaged in a Detrimental Activities Violation or is pursuing a course of conduct that threatens such a violation, Company shall have the right to suspend the vesting schedule with respect to any unvested PRSUs until it determines that a violation has occurred and or that any threatened violation has been resolved so as to longer be a threat. In the event of a Detrimental Activities Violation, Section 7 (Repayment of Proceeds Clawback Policy) may be applied as determined appropriate by the Company in the exercise of the full degree of discretion allowed under the Plan. The type of harm to the Company caused by a Detrimental Activities Violation cannot be fully measured and remedied through monetary damages and would be irreparable in nature. Accordingly, in addition to the forgoing, the Company shall retain all rights and remedies available in law or equity to enforce the restrictions and obligations that Participant has committed to in Appendix B. 
 2. Participant s Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities and the terms of this Agreement awarding PRSUs to Participant are mutually dependent, material terms. Accordingly, in the event the enforceability of any portion of the Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities is challenged by Participant and found by an Adjudicator to be void or unenforceable in any part deemed material by the Company, then the Company shall have the right to demand and receive from Participant within ten (10) business days of the Company s request to the Participant, the aggregate after-tax proceeds (taking into account all amounts of tax that would be recoverable upon a claim of loss for payment of such proceeds in the year of repayment) the Participant received upon the sale or other disposition of, or distributions in respect of, the PRSUs or Shares issued in settlement of the PRSUs. 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 3. If Participant violates one of the restrictions in Section B-2, the period of the breached restriction will be extended for an additional period of time equal to the time that elapses from commencement of the breach to the later of (a) the definitive termination of such breach or (b) the final resolution of any litigation arising from such breach provided, however, that this extension of time shall be capped so that the extension of time itself does not exceed the length of time originally proscribed for the restriction, and if this extension would make the restriction unenforceable under controlling law it will not be enforced. 
 B-6. Limitations. 
 1. E xceptions to Restrictions . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein prohibits Participant from owning a non-controlling interest consisting of two percent (2 or less of any class of securities in any publicly traded company or passive investments through an independently controlled fund such as a mutual fund, provided that Participant is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls, a business that is a Competitor, and further provided that Participant does not otherwise participate in any conduct prohibited under this Agreement. In addition, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit Participant s employment in a separately operated subsidiary or other business unit of a company that would not be a Competitor but for common ownership with a Competitor so long as Participant provides written assurances regarding the non-competitive nature of Participants position that are satisfactory to the Company and Participant remains employed solely in such non-competitive entity or unit during the pendency of the restrictions in Section B-2. Nothing herein is intended to be or is to be construed as a prohibition against general generic advertising of a company s products, services, or job openings to the public such as help wanted ads that are not targeted at the Company. The parties acknowledge that some states prohibit or place limitations on the use of covenants not to compete or noncompete covenants with an employee considered to be a low wage worker based on the employee s rate of compensation or overtime exemption status under the Fair Labor Standards Act (a Low Wage Worker Protection law, or LWWP law ). It is the parties intent not to create any restriction that would violate any controlling state LWWP law. Where the controlling state s law includes an LWWP law, it is the parties intent that this Agreement s obligations be construed so as to fit within any applicable exclusion for duty of loyalty obligations, nonsolicitation covenants, confidential information protection covenants, and intellectual property assignment agreements recognized under the LWWP law at issue, and that it does not create a prohibited covenant not to compete. 
 2. Protected Conduct . Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Participant from opposing or reporting to the relevant law-enforcement agency (such as the SEC, Equal Employment Commission, or Department of Labor) an event that Participant reasonably and in good faith believes is a violation of law, requires notice to or approval from Company before doing so, or prohibits Participant from cooperating in an investigation conducted by such a government agency, nor does it prohibit Participant from disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that Participant has reason to believe is unlawful. Participant acknowledges notice that the Defend Trade Secrets Act provides that no individual will be held criminally or civilly liable under Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (a) is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

 or indirectly, or to an attorney and made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or, (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal so that it is not made public. It also provides that an individual who pursues a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of the law may in pursuing such lawsuit disclose trade secrets to his her attorney and use trade secrets in court submissions so long as documents containing the trade secret are filed under seal and do not disclose trade secrets except as permitted by court order. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Participant from using information acquired through lawful means regarding the wages, benefits, or other terms and conditions of employment of individuals employed by Company for any purpose protected under the National Labor Relations Act (such as the right of employees to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection), unless the information is entrusted to Participant in confidence by Company as part of Participant s job duties or Participant is employed in a supervisor or management level position. Conduct of the above-described nature is referred to herein as Protected Conduct . Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect, invite, permit, or limit liability for, otherwise illegal activity such a breaking and entering, illegal computer access (hacking) or theft of the Company s property. 
 3. State-Specific Modifications . It is the intent of the Company to apply Appendix B in a manner that does not violate any law that is deemed to be the controlling law for the parties with respect to the obligations in the Agreement. If Participant resides in California and when Participant last worked for the Company Participant primarily resided and worked in California, then Section B-2 shall not apply except to the extent Participant s conduct also involves the use or disclosure of trade secrets of the Company. If Participant resides in Washington and when you last worked for the Company Participant was a Washington-based employee, then Section B-2 (Noncompete) and B-2 (Business Relationship Interference) shall not apply and Sections B-2 (Worker Nonsolicit) and B-2 (Customer Nonsolicit) shall be limited so that they only apply to prohibit Participant s solicitation of an employee of the Company to leave such employment, and solicitation of a customer of the Company to cease or reduce the extent to which it is doing business with the Company. If the Company is deemed to operate in the District of Columbia and when Participant last worked for the Company Participant worked for it in the District of Columbia, then nothing in Appendix B will be applied to prohibit Participant from being simultaneously or subsequently employed by another person, performing work or providing services for pay for another person, or operating Participant s own business. However, conduct involving disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, client lists, customer lists, or a trade secret (as defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) will remain prohibited.

 information on the consequences of Participant s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Participant understands that the Participant may contact the Participant s local human resources representative. 
 16. Detrimental Activities . The Participant acknowledges and recognizes that an important purpose of this Agreement is to align the interests of Participant with those of Chewy s stockholders and to ensure that the Participant does not engage in activity detrimental to the interests of Chewy s stockholders if Participant is going to be allowed the opportunity to participate in the financial rewards that result from the RSU and their relationship to the value of equity participation in Chewy. In addition, Participant acknowledges that an ancillary purpose consistent with protecting the interests of the stockholders arises with respect to Participant because Participant will be allowed access to confidential and proprietary information (including, but not limited to, trade secrets), as well as access to the prospective and actual customers, suppliers, investors, clients and partners of the Company, and the goodwill associated with the Company. Participant accordingly agrees to comply with the provisions of the Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities as a condition of receipt and retention of the RSUs provided for in this Agreement and their beneficial value. For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants made by Participant in this Agreement supplement and are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other restrictive covenants or similar covenants or agreements between the Participant and the Company, nor will they be construed to replace, reduce or otherwise detrimentally impact the applicability or enforceability of any other such restrictive covenants Participant may agree to with the Company. Participant acknowledges and agrees not to contest or dispute the Company s position that the prohibition of detrimental activities provided for in the Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities is inextricably connected to and part of the Company s governance of its internal affairs and relates directly to the interests of Chewy s stockholders.

Following any applicable six (6)-month delay, all such delayed payments will be paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date permitted under Section 409A of the Code that is also a business day. The Participant is solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code that may be imposed on or in respect of the Participant in connection with this Agreement, and the Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any payment made under this Plan that is determined to result in an additional tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code, nor for reporting in good faith any payment made under this Agreement as an amount includible in gross income under Section 409A of the Code.

 A-2. Avoidance of Competition and Other Detrimental Acts After Engagement. 
 Participant will comply with the following restrictions for a period of two (2) years after Participant s employment or other services engagement with the Company ends 
 1. Noncompete . Participant will not, within Participant s Territory (as defined below), directly or through the direction or control of others, acting individually or as an owner, shareholder, partner, employee, contractor, agent or otherwise, on behalf of a Competitor (a) provide, supervise or manage services that are the same as or similar in function or purpose to the services Participant provided to the Company during the last two (2) years of employment or such shorter period of time as Participant was actually employed or engaged to provide personal services to the Company (the Look Back Period (b) assist in the development or improvement of a competing product or service, or (c) provide services that are otherwise likely or probable to result in the use or disclosure of Confidential Information to a Competitor.

 1. Participant will honor all agreements with the Company regarding maintaining the confidentiality of information that qualifies as contractually protected Confidential Information, protect and preserve the value of the Company s trade secrets and proprietary information to the Company (irrespective of whether same is also covered by contractual definition of Confidential Information), and comply with Company policies and directives regarding the handling of Company records, files, computer system access, materials and property at all times.

 14 

EXHIBIT 10.2 

 2. If Participant is subject to another contractual agreement that defines what constitutes the Company s Confidential Information , that definition shall control. Absent such a controlling definition, it is understood that Confidential Information refers to an item of information, or a compilation of information, in any form (tangible or intangible), related to the business of the Company that the Company has not made public or authorized public disclosure of, and that is not generally known to the public through proper means. Participant acknowledges that, in Participant s position with the Company, Participant will obtain and or have access to Confidential Information regarding the Company s business, including, but not limited to business plans and forecasts, market analysis, marketing plans and strategies, branding strategies, pricing-related variables and strategy, the actual and anticipated research and development activities of the Company, unpatented inventions, technical data, knowledge, information and materials about trade secrets, mailing e-mailing lists, methods of operation, customer or client lists, consumer preferences and buying histories, services, proprietary know-how, non-public information about financial performance, human resources information such as that obtained from a confidential personnel file, other proprietary matters relating to the Company, and information that is entrusted to the Company in confidence by third parties with whom the Company does business or is negotiating to do business, all of which constitute valuable assets of the Company which this Agreement is designed to protect. Nothing herein restricts or prevents an employee from sharing information about their own compensation with other employees nor prevents other employees from making inquiries about the compensation earned or paid to co-workers. 
 3. Participant agrees that, upon the termination of Participant s employment or services relationship with the Company for any reason whatsoever, Participant shall return all copies, in whatever form or media, including hard copies and electronic copies, of Confidential Information to the Company, and Participant shall delete any copy of the Confidential Information on any computer file or database maintained by Participant and, upon request by the Company, Participant shall certify in writing that this has process has been completed and no copies of Confidential Information are retained. 
 A-4. Avoidance of Disparagement. 
 Participant agrees to avoid making comments that are disparaging, false, misleading, defamatory or cast in a negative light the Company, or the Company s current or former directors, officers, or employees. And, Participant agrees not to, in any respect, make any disparaging or defamatory comments concerning any aspect of Participant s relationship with the Company or any comments concerning the conduct or events which precipitated any termination of Participant s employment from the Company. However, Participant s obligations under this covenant shall not prevent Participant from exercising the right to (1) communicate with a law enforcement officer acting within the line and scope of the officer's law enforcement duties that a violation of the law has occurred or is occurring (2) communicate with a government regulator acting within the line and scope of the regulator's regulatory duties that a violation of the law has occurred or is occurring (3) respond to a lawfully served judicial, grand jury, or other lawful subpoena (4) testify in a judicial or administrative proceeding in response to a lawfully served subpoena or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction (5) confer with the obligated party's attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or representation (6) respond to lawful discovery in a judicial or administrative action provided the disparaging statement is either ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or made in compliance with a protective order entered by the same court (7) prosecute or defend a civil action between or among parties to a covered contract provided the party making the disparaging statement attempts to and, if permitted by law, does file the disparaging statement and any related pleading under

EXHIBIT 10.2 

 seal or in compliance with a protective order entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the civil action or (8) exercise federally protected statutory rights, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights under the National Labor Relations Act or the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. 
 
 A-5. Enforcement. 
 1. In the event the Company has reason to believe Participant has engaged in a Detrimental Activities Violation or is pursuing a course of conduct that threatens such a violation, the Company shall have the right to suspend the vesting schedule with respect to any unvested RSUs until it determines that a violation has occurred and or that any threatened violation has been resolved so as to longer be a threat. In the event of a Detrimental Activities Violation, Section 7 (Repayment of Proceeds Clawback Policy) of the Agreement may be applied as determined appropriate by the Company in the exercise of the full degree of discretion allowed under the Plan. The type of harm to the Company caused by a Detrimental Activities Violation cannot be fully measured and remedied through monetary damages and would be irreparable in nature. Accordingly, in addition to the forgoing, the Company shall retain all rights and remedies available in law or equity to enforce the restrictions and obligations that Participant has committed to in the Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities. 
 2. Participant s Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities and the terms of this Agreement awarding RSUs to Participant are mutually dependent, material terms. Accordingly, in the event the enforceability of any portion of the Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities is challenged by Participant and found by an Adjudicator to be void or unenforceable in any part deemed material by the Company, then the Company shall have the right to demand and receive from Participant within ten (10) business days of the Company s request to Participant, the aggregate after-tax proceeds (taking into account all amounts of tax that would be recoverable upon a claim of loss for payment of such proceeds in the year of repayment) Participant received upon the sale or other disposition of, or distributions in respect of, the RSUs or Shares issued in settlement of the RSUs. 
 3. If Participant violates one of the restrictions in Section A-2, the period of the breached restriction will be extended for an additional period of time equal to the time that elapses from commencement of the breach to the later of (a) the definitive termination of such breach or (b) the final resolution of any litigation arising from such breach provided, however, that this extension of time shall be capped so that the extension of time itself does not exceed the length of time originally proscribed for the restriction, and if this extension would make the restriction unenforceable under controlling law it will not be enforced. 
 A-6. Limitations. 
 1. Exceptions to Restrictions . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein prohibits Participant from owning a non-controlling interest consisting of 2 or less of any class of securities in any publicly traded company or passive investments through an independently controlled fund such as a mutual fund, provided that Participant is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls, a business that is a Competitor, and further provided that Participant does not otherwise participate in any conduct prohibited under this Agreement. In addition, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit Participant s employment in a separately operated subsidiary or other business unit of a company that would not be a Competitor but for 
 16 

EXHIBIT 10.2 

 common ownership with a Competitor so long as Participant provides written assurances regarding the non-competitive nature of Participants position that are satisfactory to the Company and Participant remains employed solely in such non-competitive entity or unit during the pendency of the restrictions in Section A-2. Nothing herein is intended to be or is to be construed as a prohibition against general generic advertising of a company s products, services, or job openings to the public such as help wanted ads that are not targeted at the Company. The parties acknowledge that some states prohibit or place limitations on the use of covenants not to compete or noncompete covenants with an employee considered to be a low wage worker based on the employee s rate of compensation or overtime exemption status under the Fair Labor Standards Act (a Low Wage Worker Protection law, or LWWP law ). It is the parties intent not to create any restriction that would violate any controlling state LWWP law. Where the controlling state s law includes an LWWP law, it is the parties intent that this Agreement s obligations be construed so as to fit within any applicable exclusion for duty of loyalty obligations, nonsolicitation covenants, confidential information protection covenants, and intellectual property assignment agreements recognized under the LWWP law at issue, and that it does not create a prohibited covenant not to compete. 
 2. Protected Conduct . Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Participant from opposing or reporting to the relevant law-enforcement agency (such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Equal Employment Commission, or Department of Labor) an event that Participant reasonably and in good faith believes is a violation of law, requires notice to or approval from Company before doing so, or prohibits Participant from cooperating in an investigation conducted by such a government agency, nor does it prohibit Participant from disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that Participant has reason to believe is unlawful. Participant acknowledges notice that the Defend Trade Secrets Act provides that no individual will be held criminally or civilly liable under Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (a) is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or, (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal so that it is not made public. It also provides that an individual who pursues a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of the law may in pursuing such lawsuit disclose trade secrets to his her attorney and use trade secrets in court submissions so long as documents containing the trade secret are filed under seal and do not disclose trade secrets except as permitted by court order. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Participant from using information acquired through lawful means regarding the wages, benefits, or other terms and conditions of employment of individuals employed by Company for any purpose protected under the National Labor Relations Act (such as the right of employees to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection), unless the information is entrusted to Participant in confidence by Company as part of Participant s job duties or Participant is employed in a supervisor or management level position. Conduct of the above-described nature is referred to herein as Protected Conduct . Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect, invite, permit, or limit liability for, otherwise illegal activity such a breaking and entering, illegal computer access (hacking) or theft of the Company s property. 
 
 17 

EXHIBIT 10.2 

 3. State-Specific Modifications . It is the intent of the Company to apply this Commitment to Avoid Detrimental Activities in a manner that does not violate any law that is deemed to be the controlling law for the parties with respect to the obligations in the Agreement. If Participant resides in California and when Participant last worked for the Company Participant primarily resided and worked in California, then Section A-2 shall not apply except to the extent Participant s conduct also involves the use or disclosure of trade secrets of the Company. If Participant resides in Washington and when Participant last worked for the Company Participant was a Washington-based employee, then Section A-2 (Noncompete) and A-2 (Business Relationship Interference) shall not apply and Sections A-2 (Worker Nonsolicit) and A-2 (Customer Nonsolicit) shall be limited so that they only apply to prohibit Participant s solicitation of an employee of the Company to leave such employment, and solicitation of a customer of the Company to cease or reduce the extent to which it is doing business with the Company. If the Company is deemed to operate in the District of Columbia and when Participant last worked for the Company Participant worked for it in the District of Columbia, then nothing herein will be applied to prohibit Participant from being simultaneously or subsequently employed by another person, performing work or providing services for pay for another person, or operating Participant s own business. However, conduct involving disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, client lists, customer lists, or a trade secret (as defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act) will remain prohibited.
