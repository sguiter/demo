FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, should, expects, might, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, seek, would or continue, or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include: 
 the potential impacts of raising additional capital, including dilution to our existing stockholders, restrictions on our operations or requirements that we relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates; 

the success, cost, and duration of our product development activities and clinical trials, including the enrollment rates in our clinical trials; 

the timing of our planned regulatory submissions to the FDA for our bezuclastinib product candidate and any other product candidates we may develop; 

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our bezuclastinib product candidate and any other product candidates we may develop, and any related restrictions, limitations, and/or warnings in the label of an approved product candidate; 

the potential for our identified research priorities to advance our bezuclastinib product candidate or for our teams to discover and develop additional product candidates; 

the ability to license additional intellectual property rights relating to our bezuclastinib product candidate or future product candidates from third-parties and to comply with our existing or future license agreements and/or collaboration agreements; 

our ability to commercialize our bezuclastinib product candidate and future product candidates in light of the intellectual property rights of others; 

our ability to obtain funding for our operations, including funding necessary to complete further discovery, development and commercialization of our existing and future product candidates; 

the scalability and commercial viability of our manufacturing methods and processes; 

the commercialization of our product candidates, if approved; 

our ability to attract collaborators with development, regulatory, and commercialization expertise; 

future agreements with third parties in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates and any other approved product; 

the size and growth potential of the markets for our product candidates, and our ability to serve those markets; 

the rate and degree of market acceptance of our product candidates; 

the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved; 

regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; 

i 

the impact of adverse business and economic conditions including inflationary pressures, general economic slowdown or a recession, high interest rates, changes in monetary policy, banking institution instability and the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government; 

our ability to contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers and their ability to perform adequately; 

the development and success of competing therapies that are or may be under development in clinical trials or become available commercially; 

our ability to attract and retain key scientific and management personnel; 

the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, and needs for additional financing; 

our use of the proceeds from the private placements, sales of our preferred stock and public offerings of our common stock from time to time; and 

our expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our bezuclastinib product candidate and future product candidates. 

While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those set forth under the caption Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is bezuclastinib, also known as CGT9486, a highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving Systemic Mastocytosis SM ), a serious and rare disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors GIST ), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. Bezuclastinib is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations. We are developing bezuclastinib in patients living with Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis AdvSM ), Non-Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis Non-AdvSM and GIST. In addition to bezuclastinib, the Cogent Research Team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases initially targeting mutations in FGFR2, ErbB2, PI3K and KRAS. 
 The following is an illustration of the status of our current clinical and pre-clinical programs: 
 Our Pipeline 

16 

Bezuclastinib- SM 
 The vast majority of AdvSM and Non-AdvSM patients have a KIT D816V mutation. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. For patients with Non-AdvSM, while their lifespan is not impacted by the disease, these patients suffer from a poor quality of life and new treatment options are badly needed. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to bezuclastinib for the treatment of Mastocytosis. 
 SUMMIT (Non-AdvSM) 
 SUMMIT is our randomized, global, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-part Phase 2 clinical trial for patients with Non-AdvSM. The study is designed to explore the safety and efficacy of bezuclastinib in patients with moderate to severe Non-AdvSM, which includes Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis ISM ), Smoldering Systemic Mastocytosis SSM and Bone Marrow Mastocytosis. SUMMIT Part 1 completed enrollment in the third quarter of 2023, including over enrollment at 54 patients across Part 1a and Part 1b. SUMMIT Part 2 is a registration-directed study that is currently enrolling and expected to include 159 patients. 
 From the data collected in Part 1 of SUMMIT and in accordance with FDA guidelines, we have developed a novel patient reported outcomes measure PROM called Mastocytosis Symptom Severity Daily Diary MS2D2 ). Based on literature review, patient and physician interviews, and data from SUMMIT Part 1, we believe our MS2D2 is a reliable, valid and fit-for-purpose PROM. The MS2D2 Total Symptom Score TSS is comprised of 11 items, and scored on a 0-110 scale. We expect that a comparison of week 24 mean absolute change from baseline in MS2D2 TSS between bezuclastinib and placebo will serve as the measurement of the primary endpoint of the SUMMIT Part 2 study. In June 2024, we announced a positive discussion with the FDA and that we reached alignment with the FDA on the use of MS2D2 in Part 2 of SUMMIT. We expect to complete enrollment in SUMMIT Part 2 in the first quarter of 2025, with top-line results expected in the second half of 2025. 
 In February 2024, we presented data from SUMMIT Part 1b at the 2024 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology AAAAI ). Thirty four patients were enrolled in Part 1b and were treated with either bezuclastinib or placebo plus best supportive care. Patients were enrolled with the following sub-types: 33 patients with ISM and one patient with SSM. One patient had received prior avapritinib. These patients were evaluated for signs of clinical activity over 12 weeks, including well-accepted biomarkers of disease burden. Based on the totality of the results from SUMMIT Part 1, the data support 100 mg QD as the optimal dose of bezuclastinib in Part 2 of SUMMIT for patients with Non-AdvSM RP2D ). 
 At the RP2D and as of the cut-off date of December 18, 2023, 100 of patients with baseline tryptase 20ng/mL achieved 
 Patients enrolled in SUMMIT Part 1b were evaluated for signs of clinical activity over 12 weeks using multiple PRO measures, including MS2D2 and the Mast Cell Quality-of-Life MC-QoL ). At the RP2D, patients reported a 51 mean improvement in overall symptom severity MS2D2 TSS from baseline at week 12 for bezuclastinib 100 mg versus 18 improvement for placebo. Additionally, patients at the RP2D reported a statistically significant reduction in total symptom severity after 12 weeks when compared to placebo (-23.78 vs. -9.03; p=0.0003) and 70 of patients at the RP2D achieved 50 reduction in MS2D2 TSS at Week 12 versus 8 placebo patients. Patients at the RP2D reported a 49 mean improvement in quality of life (MC-QoL) versus 24 for placebo. Additionally, patients at the RP2D reported a statistically significant improvement in quality of life after 12 weeks when compared to placebo 24.86 vs. -12.39, p=0.046). 
 The majority of treatment emergent adverse events were low grade and reversible with no bleeding or cognitive impairment events reported across cohorts. There were no dose reductions in the 100 mg cohort and two dose reductions in the 150 mg cohort (Grade 1 ALT and Grade 2 abdominal pain). Only one serious adverse event SAE was reported across both cohorts, which occurred in the 150mg cohort, when a patient experienced ALT/AST increase that led to discontinuation. SUMMIT Part 2 is currently ongoing using the RP2D. 
 In June 2024, we presented additional data from SUMMIT Part 1 at the 2024 European Hematology Association EHA Congress. As of the cutoff date, December 18, 2023, patients in Part 1 treated at the recommended dose of 100 mg bezuclastinib demonstrated >90 reductions across all markers of mast cell burden. Additional data also show meaningful reduction in symptom severity and objective measures of disease, including a substantial reduction in mast cell reactions (>50 and patients most severe symptoms as measured by MS2D2, clinically meaningful reduction in all individual MS2D2 TSS symptoms and across domains, as well as additional symptoms including dizziness, diarrhea severity, and brain fog, and clinically meaningful improvement in skin symptoms as well as objective reduction in skin lesions. Consistent with results previously reported, as of the December 18, 2023 cutoff date, the RP2D demonstrates a favorable safety and tolerability profile. There were no bleeding or cognitive impairment adverse events reported and no SAEs reported.

APEX (AdvSM) 
 APEX is our global, open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AdvSM evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of bezuclastinib. In June 2022, we reported positive interim clinical data from Part 1 of the APEX trial at the 2022 EHA Congress, and we presented updated positive clinical data from Part 1 in an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology ASH Annual Meeting in December 2022. In April 2023, we initiated the registration-directed Part 2 of the APEX trial at 150 mg daily dose of bezuclastinib. We remain on track to deliver top-line results from the APEX trial by mid-2025. 
 In December 2023, at the 2023 ASH meeting, we reported additional positive clinical data from Part 1 of the APEX trial. As of the data cutoff date of September 25, 2023, 32 patients had been treated in Part 1 at one of four dose levels of the original formulation (50 mg BID, 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID or 400 mg QD). Patients were enrolled with the following sub-types: seven patients with ASM, 23 patients with SM-AHN, and two patients with MCL. As of the cut-off date of September 25, 2023, 32 patients enrolled were evaluated for signs of clinical activity and 27 patients were evaluable for response per the modified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria. An objective response rate ("ORR") of 52 (including complete remission CR ), CR with partial hematologic remission CRh ), partial remission PR )) was achieved, including a 56 ORR for TKI-treatment-na ve patients. An ORR of 75 was achieved by pure pathological response PPR criteria, including an ORR of 86 for TKI-treatment-na ve patients. All patients receiving the 100mg BID achieved PR or better and remain on trial with 3 patients at 30 cycles of treatment. The 150mg QD dose of our optimized formulation selected for APEX Part 2 is expected to deliver patient exposures consistent with the 100mg BID dose of the original formulation used in Part 1. An additional APEX cohort was also initiated in the third quarter of 2023 and is designed to allow concomitant administration of bezuclastinib with azacitadine in patients with SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm. 
 Bezuclastinib- GIST 
 We are also pursuing the development of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib as a potential second line treatment for patients living with GIST. GIST is a cancer frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. First-line therapy for the vast majority of GIST patients is imatinib, followed by sunitinib monotherapy as the current second-line therapy for the majority of patients that eventually develop resistance to imatinib. 
 PEAK (GIST) 
 PEAK is our randomized open-label, global Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib compared to sunitinib alone in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib. The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to bezuclastinib for the treatment of GIST. Patient enrollment for the pivotal portion of the PEAK trial was completed in the third quarter of 2024. Based on strong global patient interest, a total of 413 patients were enrolled in the trial. In addition, we completed a pre-planned interim futility analysis, and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee IDMC recommended continuing the PEAK study without modification. This pre-specified analysis was based on an assessment of progression-free survival PFS as determined by independent central review and did not include the option for early stopping due to efficacy. Top line results are expected by the end of 2025. 
 In June 2024, we presented updated positive clinical data from the lead-in portion of PEAK Part 1 at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO meeting. As of the cutoff date, April 1, 2024, the 42 patients in Part 1 have been on study for a median of 15.3 months. The median progression-free survival mPFS during treatment with bezuclastinib and sunitinib was 10.2 months in all of these heavily pre-treated GIST patients. In a subset of second-line GIST patients with only prior imatinib, which most closely resembles patients currently enrolling in the Phase 3 registration-enabling PEAK study, the data demonstrate a mPFS of 19.4 months. In addition, the objective response rate ORR in all patients treated with bezuclastinib and sunitinib was 27.5 and in the subset of second-line patients the ORR was 33.3 , per investigator assessment. Combination treatment resulted in a disease control rate of 80 in all patients and 100 in second-line patients with prior imatinib only. As of the data cutoff, the combination of bezuclastinib and sunitinib does not appear to add to the severity of adverse events known to be associated with sunitinib monotherapy and is well-tolerated. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events TEAEs were low-grade and reversible and discontinuations due to TEAEs remain limited. 
 In May 2024, we also announced the initiation of a new advanced Phase 2 clinical trial of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib in later line GIST patients that is being sponsored by the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration and in collaboration with The Life Raft Group and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The open label, single arm Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate the mPFS as well as the safety and tolerability of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib in 40 patients with GIST who have previously progressed on sunitinib. This trial is focused on later line patients that are not eligible for PEAK and have limited treatment options.

Worldwide rights to develop and commercialize bezuclastinib are exclusively licensed from Plexxikon Inc., a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group Plexxikon ). Under the terms of the license agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development milestones of up to 7.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones and up to 25.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain regulatory milestones. During the second quarter of 2022, as a result of the progression of the PEAK study, the first clinical milestone was achieved, resulting in payment of 2.5 million to Plexxikon in June 2022. As of September 30, 2024, no other milestone payments have been made. Patents protecting bezuclastinib include composition of matter claims which have been issued in the US and other key territories and provide exclusivity through 2033 and potentially beyond through patent term extensions. In addition, we filed a patent application in 2023 seeking to protect our optimized formulation of bezuclastinib that is currently being used in all three of our on-going clinical trials, which could potentially provide exclusivity through at least 2043. 
 CGT4859 
 Our research team is building a pipeline of small molecule inhibitors, with our first efforts aimed toward targeting currently undrugged mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR ). FGFR mutations are well-established oncogenic drivers in multiple diseases, but approved medicines fail to capture the full landscape of FGFR altered tumor types, with FGFR1-mediated hyperphosphatemia serving as the most common dose-limiting toxicity for pan-FGFR inhibitors. We have selected our FGFR2 clinical candidate, CGT4859. In April 2023, we reported preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research AACR 2023 Annual Meeting providing the first published evidence of CGT4859 a reversible, selective FGFR2 inhibitor with coverage of activating and emerging resistance mutations that spares inhibition of FGFR1. Preclinical data demonstrate a profile that delivers equipotent coverage across both key gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations (V564X, N549X) in FGFR2, while avoiding any evidence of FGFR1-linked hyperphosphatemia at efficacious plasma concentrations. In October 2023, we presented updated preclinical data at the 2023 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. Preclinical data demonstrate a profile that exhibits low namomolar potency on WT FGFR2 and FGFR2 mutations and is selective against the kinome, as well as a panel of ion channels and receptors. Exploratory pharmacokinetics studies conducted across species showed CGT4859 to be a low-clearance compound with high oral bioavailability. Further, in a mutant-driven mouse model, CGT4859 demonstrated dose-responsive tumor growth inhibition with complete regressions at 5 mg/kg PO and was well-tolerated. In addition, as a reversible inhibitor, the Cogent program retains enzymatic potency against potential cysteine 491 mutations. We initiated a Phase 1 study of CGT4859 in patients with FGFR2 mutations, including advanced cholangiocarcinoma, in the third quarter of 2024. The trial will explore the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of escalating doses of CGT4859 with a goal of selecting an active and well tolerated dose for further clinical investigation. Preliminary results from this trial are expected in 2025. 
 Research programs
 
 The Cogent Research Team, based in Boulder, Colorado, is focused on pioneering best-in-class, small molecule therapeutics to expand our pipeline and deliver novel precision therapies for patients living with unmet medical needs. For ErbB2, PI3K and KRAS we see opportunities to provide a more robust molecular response compared to existing therapies. 
 ErbB2 
 Our research team is also advancing a novel, ErbB2 mutant program, which is focused on actionable and underserved mutations in a variety of solid tumor indications. In April 2023, we reported preclinical data at AACR describing a series of novel compounds which potently inhibit several key ErbB2 mutations, including YVMA insertions, while sparing inhibition of EGFR. An exemplar compound from these series demonstrates advantages versus tucatinib, an approved benchmark compound, on tumor growth inhibition in a peripheral ErbB2 L755S driven mutant model, as well as in an ErbB2 driven intracranial model. Recent program advances with a novel chemotype have further improved ErbB2 mutational potency and selectivity and improved human whole blood stability to nearly 24 hours, suggesting a favorable profile for optimal clinical efficacy. Updated data was presented in November 2023 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium SABCS and at AACR in April 2024. The updated data presented shows that CGT4255 demonstrated low nM potency against ErbB2 wild-type and oncogenic ErbB2 mutations with greater than 100-fold selectivity over wild-type-EGFR. In addition to impressive selectivity across a broad range of kinases, receptors and ion channels, CGT4255 has exceptional half-life in human whole blood and liver cytosol fractions. Dose ascending PK data in mice showed low clearance and high oral bioavailability at all doses, with best-in-class 80 brain penetrance at 100 mg/kg. Maximum inhibition of ErbB2 was observed at a 30 mg/kg PO dose in both NIH/3T3 ErbB2-YVMA and ErbB2-L755S tumor models, with complete regressions at 100 mg/kg PO BID in the NIH3T3 ErbB2-L755S TGI model and was well tolerated. These advances continue to highlight a favorable profile for optimal clinical efficacy. We selected our ErbB2 clinical candidate and initiated IND-enabling studies in mid-2024. 
 19 

PI3K 
 Our research team is also developing a potential best-in-class, wild-type-sparing, PI3K inhibitor that provides coverage for the H1047R mutation, which affects >30,000 cancer patients each year. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K pathway is a key cell cycle regulating pathway that has an established role in tumor growth and development. PI3K mutations are highly prevalent in many solid tumors and are present in 36 of all breast cancer patients. The approved agents for these patients often lead to dose limitations, resulting from activity against wild-type PI3K . Preclinical data was presented at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR International Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics EORTC-NCI-AACR in October 2024 and highlighted that CGT6297 is an allosteric inhibitor of PI3K, was well-tolerated in the tumor growth inhibition efficacy models and has been profiled based on its selectivity for H1047R over WT PI3K. CGT6297 demonstrated low nM potency in H1047R mutant PI3K cell lines, differentiated dose ascending PK in mice with high bioavailability and low clearance. CGT4824 also showed >95 inhibition of pAKT in a H1047R PD model, importantly without increases in insulin or C-peptide. Its efficacy profile was superior to a clinically-relevant dose of Alpelisib in the NCI H1048 mouse tumor growth inhibition model. CGT6297 has been selected as our clinical candidate for the PI3K 1047 mutation focused project. IND-enabling studies are expected to be initiated in 2025. 
 KRAS 
 Our research team is also developing a potent and selective KRAS inhibitor. Mutations in KRAS are among the most prevalent mutations found in cancer, occurring most often in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Preclinical data was presented at the EORTC-NCI-AACR meeting and highlighted our internally-developed pan KRAS(ON) inhibitor with selectivity over HRAS and NRAS and picomolar (pM) activity across KRAS mutations without the potential liabilities of molecules in the class. Following oral administration, CGT6737 demonstrated robust PK/PD and tumor growth inhibition with 90 PD inhibition in mouse xenograft models. Lead optimization of CGT6737 is ongoing. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Since our inception in 2014, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, staffing our company, and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were 187.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net losses of 138.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 791.6 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we: 
 initiate and increase enrollment for our existing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates; 

continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; 

acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 

maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional research, clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel; 

establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; 

seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and 

add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts. 

We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution. 
 20 

As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 345.5 million. Based on our current plans, we expect that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through clinical readouts from ongoing SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include: 
 expenses incurred in connection with the discovery, preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations CROs 

the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations CMOs 

employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

laboratory supplies and animal care; 

facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and 

payments made under third-party licensing agreements. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 Certain of our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of costs, such as fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs, and CROs in connection with our discovery, preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with the manufacture of bezuclastinib, costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. 
 Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following: 
 the timing and progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

21 

the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements; 

our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones; 

the enrollment rates in our clinical trials; 

our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; 

the future productivity of the Cogent Research Team in Boulder, CO and its ability to discover new product candidates and build our pipeline; 

the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority; 

the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

the success in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties; 

our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; 

our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; 

the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved; 

the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors; 

competition with other products; and 

a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with the expansion of operations to support our on-going discovery, preclinical and clinical activities and current and future commercialization activities. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations, primarily income from subleasing a portion of our former headquarters facilities. 
 Change in Fair Value of the CVR liability 
 This consists of changes in the fair value of the contingent value right CVR liability. 
 22 

Income Taxes 
 Since our inception, we have not recorded any current or deferred tax benefit for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023. We reevaluate the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 195.7 million and 110.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2035. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2023, 192.4 million is available to be carried forward indefinitely but we are permitted to offset a maximum of 80 of taxable income per year. As of December 31, 2023, we had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of 14.0 million and 3.1 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2040 and 2035, respectively. The Company also had federal orphan drug tax credits of 12.4 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2041. 
 Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 over a three-year period. 
 We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.

Total research and development expense increased by 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher external research and development costs associated with the manufacture and development of bezuclastinib, including costs associated with the accelerated enrollment of the SUMMIT and PEAK trials and ongoing cost of the APEX trial, and the continued development and progression of our research pipeline. Additionally, there was an increase in unallocated expenses driven by higher personnel costs due to an increase in headcount, including stock-based compensation expense which increased by 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 11.8 million, compared to 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount, including stock-based compensation expense which increased by 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and initial commercial readiness activities initiated in the third quarter of 2024 . 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8 million, compared to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to higher average interest rates and invested balances in cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was less than 0.1 million and represented miscellaneous income. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was nil.

Total research and development expense increased by 45.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher external research and development costs associated with the manufacture and development of bezuclastinib, including costs associated with the APEX, SUMMIT and PEAK trials, and the continued development and progression of our research pipeline. Additionally, there was an increase in unallocated expenses driven by higher personnel costs due to an increase in headcount, including stock-based compensation expense which increased by 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 31.6 million, compared to 24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount, including stock-based compensation expense which increased by 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and initial commercial readiness activities initiated in the third quarter of 2024 . 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.2 million, compared to 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to higher average invested balances in cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was less than 0.1 million, compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income represented miscellaneous income while for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income primarily represented sublease income recognized resulting from the sublease of a portion of our former corporate headquarters space. The decrease in other income, net is driven by the expiration of our former corporate headquarters lease and associated sublease in April 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of the CVR liability 
 The change in fair value of CVR liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was nil, compared to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded a decrease in fair value of the liability of 1.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, reducing the liability to zero as the probability of additional CVR payments occurring prior to the expiration of CVR term was remote. The CVRs expired on August 6, 2023 and no further payments will be made to CVR holders. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with our former collaboration partner. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have historically funded our operations primarily through the public offering and private placement of our securities and consideration received from our collaborative agreements. 
 25 

On May 6, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The shelf registration statement allows us to sell from time-to-time up to 300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities, for our own account in one or more offerings. The terms of any offering under the shelf registration statement will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering. 
 Additionally, on May 6, 2022, pursuant to the Form S-3, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Guggenheim Securities, LLC Guggenheim Securities ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 75.0 million through Guggenheim Securities, as the sales agent. As of September 30, 2024, no shares have been sold under the Sales Agreement. 
 On June 13, 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of 17,899,698 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 8.25 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 2,730,000 additional shares of common stock) and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,030,302 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 8.24 per underlying share. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately 161.9 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 
 On February 10, 2023, we filed a Form S-3ASR with the SEC 2023 Shelf Registration for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, debt securities and units, which became effective immediately upon filing. At the time any of the securities covered by the 2023 Shelf Registration are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the SEC containing specific information about the terms of any such offering. 
 In June 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of 14,375,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 12.00 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,875,000 additional shares of common stock). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately 161.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 On February 13, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement for a private placement (the Private Placement with certain institutional and accredited investors (each, a Purchaser and collectively, the Purchasers ). The closing of the Private Placement occurred on February 16, 2024. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased (i) an aggregate of 17,717,997 shares of our common stock at a price per share of 7.50, and (ii) 12,280 shares of our Series B Non-voting Convertible Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock ), at a price per share of 7,500.00. Net proceeds were approximately 213.4 million after deducting placement fees and offering costs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 135,548,559 shares outstanding on an as-converted basis, which consists of (i) 110,458,249 shares of common stock outstanding, (ii) pre-funded warrants that are exercisable for 606,060 shares of common stock, (iii) 70,465 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are convertible into 17,616,250 shares of common stock and (iv) 6,868 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are convertible into 6,868,000 shares of common stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 345.5 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through clinical readouts from ongoing SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026.

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 147.2 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of 187.9 million, partially offset by net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 12.7 million and by net noncash charges of 28.0 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of a 14.7 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a 0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a 1.0 million decrease in the operating lease liability. 
 26 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 109.6 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of 138.0 million, partially offset by net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 6.4 million and by net noncash charges of 22.0 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of a 9.5 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities partially offset by a 2.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a 0.5 million decrease in the operating lease liability and a 0.1 million increase in other assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 23.4 million which consisted of purchases of property and equipment and marketable securities, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 108.3 million which consisted of purchases of property and equipment and marketable securities, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 214.4 million, which consisted of 213.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and Series B Preferred Stock in the Private Placement, net of paid offering costs and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 163.5 million, which consisted of 161.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering, net of paid offering costs, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical development of our current and any future product candidates and conduct additional research, development and preclinical activities. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: 
 the initiation, progress, timing, and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future potential product candidates; 

any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA s issuance of a refusal to file letter or a request for additional information; 

adverse results or delays in clinical trials; 

our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial; 

adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates; 

changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals; 

adverse developments concerning our manufacturers; 

our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or our inability to do so at acceptable prices; 

our inability to establish collaborations, if desired or needed; 

our failure to commercialize our product candidates; 

27 

additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; and 

unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates. 

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 345.5 million as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through clinical readouts from ongoing SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We will require additional funding to complete the critical activities planned to support ongoing research and development programs. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes to our market risks as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have a material adverse effect on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There have been no material changes from our risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024. The risks described in our Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company.
