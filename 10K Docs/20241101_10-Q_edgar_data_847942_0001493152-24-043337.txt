 (UNAUDITED) 

shares of STQN common
stock (representing of STQN s issued and outstanding common stock after the Transaction) to the two shareholders of Union
in exchange for shares of Union s common stock, representing of Union s issued and outstanding common stock. As
a result of the Transaction, STQN now owns all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Union, the surviving company of the merger
between STQN Sub and Union. Prior to the Transaction, Exworth Management LLC Exworth Management owned of the outstanding
common stock of Union and approximately of the outstanding common stock of STQN. 

The
Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States GAAP ). Under this method of accounting, STQN was treated as the acquired company for
financial reporting purposes and Union was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the terms of the Transaction and other factors
including: (i) Union s stockholders having a majority of the voting power of the combined company and (ii) the operations of Union
comprising all of the ongoing operations of the combined entity. Operations prior to the Transaction are those of Union. 

Subsequent
to the Transaction, the Company conducts its operations through Union, a Delaware corporation, which was formed on March 16, 2022. Union
provides loans that are collateralized by digital assets such as Bitcoin and will accept as collateral other types of alternative assets
such as eCommerce accounts receivable, recursive payments of software as service (SAAS) subscriptions, IP and copyrights. 

STQN
and Union are collectively referred to as the Company . 

Nature
of Operations 

Loans
made by the Company are collateralized with digital assets of such kind and in such amounts as the Company determines from time to time
to be acceptable. As of September 30, 2024, there are no loans receivable outstanding and no digital assets collateral. As of December
31, 2023, the only digital asset the Company accepted as collateral was Bitcoin. The Company s target markets are individuals and
commercial enterprises that hold digital assets and are seeking liquidity without selling their digital assets, with limited or no options
to obtain a credit line or business loans from conventional financial institutions. The Company provides term loans, up to two years,
to these individuals and commercial enterprises. 

The
Company originates U.S. dollar denominated loans and offers loans to both individual and business borrowers who own digital assets and
desire to borrow against such digital assets rather than selling them. Borrowers that receive loans from the Company are required to
transfer a specified value of digital assets to the Company to be held as collateral and security for the repayment of the loans. Upon
maturity and repayment of a borrower s loan, the digital asset collateral is returned to the borrower. 

Also,
under the loan agreements with borrowers, the Company has the right to repledge collateral to secure transactions, including loans that
the Company maintains with third parties for capital management purposes and market neutral trading strategies to generate investment
returns. See Note 6 Note Payable for a description of these loan arrangements. 

The
Company also provides loan administration services to borrowers and lenders. The Company is responsible for processing loan payments,
forwarding information to counterparties, responding to inquiries, keeping loan profile records, preparing loan statements, and managing
bank accounts and collateral accounts. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared applicable to a going concern which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had
cash of and a shareholders deficit of . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had
losses of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had losses of 
and , respectively. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern for a reasonable period of time. Management plans to seek debt and/or equity financing to operate until such times as the Company
has established sufficient ongoing revenues to cover its costs. However, there is no assurance that management will be successful in
accomplishing its plan. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should be the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern, 

per Federally insured institution. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had uninsured balances on deposit at banks. 

Loan
administration services 

The
Company provides loan administration services to customers (see Note 9). The Company serves as a third party that acts as a liaison between
the lender and borrower of a loan. The Company has two performance obligations, which consist of a servicing part and a reporting part.
For servicing, the Company is generally responsible for processing loan payments, forwarding information to counterparties, responding
to inquiries, and managing banking and collateral accounts. Revenue is based on a fixed percentage of the loan principal and is recognized
at closing of a loan. For reporting, the Company is generally responsible for keeping records of a loan profile, and preparing drawdown,
disbursement, and amortization details on a monthly statement for customer s review. Revenue is generally a fixed monthly charge
and recognized over the life of a loan until fully repaid. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is part of the
FASB s initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The ASU eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles
of ASC 740, Income Taxes, and simplifies income tax accounting in several areas. The new standard was effective for the Company for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a significant effect on the Company s financial
statements.

The
Company determined the fair value per Bitcoin to be on December 31, 2023, using the price provided at 8:00 p.m., New York Time
by the Digital Asset Exchange Market considered to be the Company s principal market (Fed Reserve Coinbase Bitcoin). 

. On July 12, 2024, Union repaid its note payable of . On July
15, 2024, the 100 Bitcoins collateral was returned from the lender and returned to the borrower. 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company had one loan receivable in the principal amount of . The receivable bore interest at per
annum, was due in July 2024, and was secured by 100 Bitcoins. 

At
the time of origination, loans are secured and over-collateralized with digital assets the Company determines from time to time to be
acceptable collateral. As of September 30, 2024 there were no loans receivable outstanding and no digital assets collateral. As of December
31, 2023, the only digital asset the Company accepted as collateral was Bitcoin. Borrowers make principal payments at maturity and make
interest payments quarterly. The interest rate is set by the Company and is impacted by loan terms and amounts. Once a loan application
is approved, a loan is created when a borrower sends collateral to the Company s collateral wallet (the The Company s
Custody Wallet and funds are disbursed to the borrower s bank account. During the term of the loan, the Company may repledge
a borrower s collateral and move it out of the Company s Custody Wallet. Total borrower collateral repledged of 
is presented at fair value on the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. During the term of the loan, borrowers are required to maintain
a certain level of loan to value LTV ratio, which is the loan amount divided by real time fair value of the collateral.
If at any time the LTV reaches the LTV margin call level, borrowers are required to deposit additional collateral with the Company so
that the LTV drops to the required level. According to its loan agreements, the Company has the ability to sell or liquidate a borrower s
collateral assets to repay its loan principal if a margin call is not cured as required under the contractual terms. If the threshold
for collateral liquidation is surpassed, the Company may liquidate a portion or all of the collateral assets. The liquidation handling
fee is generally of the principal amount of the loan. Since inception , the Company has not received any liquidation fees. 

The
Company does not recognize its digital asset-backed loans extended as sale transactions as defined by FASB ASC 860. Upon the maturity
of a digital asset-backed loan, the Company expects to receive back the borrowed amount it originally extended as a loan plus borrower
fees and any unpaid interest and to return the borrower s collateral. The Company values its collateralized outstanding loans at
par, shown at principal values. Interest receivable on loans in the amount of nil and is presented on the Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Loans are secured by digital assets which are the collateral for loans. The Company originates
loans at various LTVs to over-collateralize each loan. Otherwise, the Company may
at its sole and absolute discretion sell, transfer, liquidate or otherwise dispose of all or a part of the collateral and apply the net
proceeds to the discharge of the borrower s obligations. A summary of loans receivable by expected future cash flows is presented
below: 

The
LTV ratio on the one loan receivable at December 31, 2023 was .. 

On
December 31, 2023, the fair value of the collateral received to secure the loan receivable balance was . As of December 31,
2023, all the collateral balance was repledged, resulting in a corresponding liability of , which is included as Digital
asset collateral due to customer on the Balance Sheet. There is a risk that financings made with borrower collateral could be
worth less than the underlying borrower collateral, in which case the Company would have to purchase additional digital assets to repay
the borrowers collateral. 

Allowance
for Loan Losses 

An
allowance for loan losses is established with respect to loans held for investment through periodic charges to the provision for loan
losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the future collection of the principal
of a loan is unlikely. To date, the Company does not have any experience with losses on the portfolio and therefore has not
 recorded an allowance for loan losses in the periods presented. 

Management
classifies loans into risk categories based on their original LTV and monitors the current LTV on a recurring basis. The allowance is
subjective as it requires material estimates, including such factors as historical trends. Other qualitative factors considered may include
items such as uncertainties in the digital asset market, changes in the composition of the Company s lending portfolio, business
conditions and emerging trends. Recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on conditions that may be beyond
the Company s control. Although the Company has not experienced any losses on the portfolio to date, any combination of the previously
described factors may affect its loan portfolio resulting in potential loan losses and could require an allowance for loan loss, which
could impact future periods. 

As
of September 30, 2024, management has not liquidated any collateral and the Company has not incurred any losses on the outstanding portfolio.
The Company also over collateralizes its loans with digital assets, which allow the Company to liquidate the pledged collateral for an
amount at least equal to the principal owed. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had one loan receivable and this loan had a LTV.
As a result, the Company recorded allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2023. On July 10, 2024, Union collected its loan receivable
of . On July 12, 2024, Union repaid its note payable of . On July 15, 2024, the 100 Bitcoins collateral was returned
from the lender and returned to the borrower.

 -

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of domestic deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and taxing strategies in making this assessment.

United States income tax purposes, STQN has at September 30, 2024 (approximately

Overview 

Effective
December 22, 2022, we entered into and consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger Merger Agreement whereby we acquired
all of the outstanding shares of Exworth Union and it became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Immediately prior to consummation of the Merger
Agreement Exworth Management owned 74 of our outstanding shares of common stock and 91 of the outstanding shares of Exworth Union.
Exworth Union is engaged in providing loans collateralized by digital assets. Prior to the Merger, we were a shell company
with no commercial operations and had generated no revenues other than nominal interest income. The transaction effected through the
Merger Agreement was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Exworth Union was determined to be the accounting acquirer and we,
Strategic, were treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes 

The
discussion below pertains to our financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period commencing
March 16, 2022, the date Exworth Union was formed and ending March 31, 2022. For a discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations prior to the formation of Exworth Union please refer to filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission before consummation of the Merger Agreement. 

Exworth
Union, a Delaware corporation, was formed on March 16, 2022. It provides loans that are collateralized by digital assets including Bitcoin
and will accept other types of alternative collaterals such as eCommerce account receivables, recursive payments of subscriptions, IP
and copyrights, though the only form of collateral that has been accepted to date is Bitcoin. The target customers are individuals and
commercial enterprises that hold digital assets and are seeking liquidity without selling their digital assets, with limited or no access
to obtain credit lines or business loans from conventional financial institutions. We provide term loans, up to two years, to these individuals
and commercial enterprises.

Revenue 

Interest
income, our major source of income, was 16,177 and 43,671 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and
 13,747 and 41,241 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On July 15, 2024, Union collected its loan receivable of
 1,374,691 and repaid its note payable of 1,388,576 and the 100 Bitcoins collateral was returned from lender and returned to the borrower.
As of December 31, 2023, we have 1 loan in our loan portfolio, a consumer loan secured by Bitcoin. The LTV ratio of our loan portfolio
as of December 31, 2023 was 32 . The LTV ratio has as high as 35 and as low as 19 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loan
admin service income, was nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and nil and 3,950 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The Company provides loan admin services to a related party. The Company serves as a third party that acts
as a liaison between the lender and borrower of a loan.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 44,388 and 117,012, respectively, for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 33,892 and 132,229. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, it primarily includes legal, accounting and other professional expense related to company s daily operation. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was 1,447 and 18,804 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 8,679 and 26,036 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023, incurred pursuant to a master loan agreement we entered with a U.S. based lender. The loan
has a term of 24 months with quarterly interest-only payments with principal to be paid at maturity. No margin call was initiated by
our lender during the period from inception of the loan to July 15, 2024. 

Amortization
of Loan Origination Fee 

Our
lender charged a 1 origination fee of the principal amount that we borrowed. The origination fee was deducted from the loan principal
and will be amortized evenly through the loan term. Total amortization of loan origination fee for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 290 and 3,761, respectively, and 1,736 and 5,207 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss was 29,948 and 95,906, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 30,560 and
 118,281 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Among the more significant factors that may cause our net income to
vary from period to period are: 1) the number of loans; 2) the interest rates that we charge our borrowers; 3) the interest rate that
we pay to our lenders; 4) the fair market value of collateral held by us or pledged to our lenders; and 5) The allowance for loan loss
of our loans. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 25,757 and 54,169, respectively. The accompanying condensed financial statements
have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. To date, we have financed our operations through a private placement
of equity raising approximately 350,000. We also entered into a master loan agreement with a U.S. based lender. The loan is non-recourse
and collateralized by pledging our customers collateral. The balance on the loan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023
is 0 and 1,384,815, net of unamortized origination fee of 0 and 3,761, respectively, and collateralized with 100 Bitcoins. 

In
assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash-on-hand, operating and capital expenditure commitments. We believe our current
working capital is sufficient to support our operations for the next twelve months. However, if we are unable to raise additional capital,
we may not be able to execute our business plan. We will use our limited personnel and financial resources in connection with developing
our business plan, including developing a proprietary software platform, issuing equity or debt securities, or obtaining additional credit
facilities. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our existing shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. Our obligation
to bear credit risk for certain financing transactions we facilitate may also strain our operating cash flow. We have no commitments
for the purchase of our equity and, should we need to raise capital, we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts
or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of
the JOBS Act, which allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public
and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not
be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

17 

There
are no limitations in our certificate of incorporation on our ability to borrow funds or raise funds through the issuance of capital
stock to fund our working capital requirements. Our limited resources and lack of recent operating history may make it difficult to borrow
funds or raise capital. Such inability to borrow funds or raise funds through the issuance of capital stock required to facilitate our
business plan may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects, including the ability to fund our business
plan. To the extent that debt financing ultimately proves to be available, any borrowing will subject us to various risks traditionally
associated with indebtedness, including the risks of interest rate fluctuations and insufficiency of cash flow to pay principal and interest,
including debt of an acquired business.

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation,
the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded for the reasons discussed below that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by a company s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by a company s board
of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of our management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management,
including our President and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Management s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting is based on the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Based
on its assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September
30, 2024, with the following aspects being noted as the potential material weakness: due to the lack of an oversight committee, insufficient
accounting personnel for appropriate segregation of duties and a lack of personnel with familiarity with U. S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of our Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit our Company to provide only management s report in this Quarterly
Report. 

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the
liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date
hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

under whose supervision he shall be. He shall keep in safe custody the seal of the corporation and, when authorized by the board of directors,
affix the same to any instrument requiring it and, when so affixed, it shall be attested by his signature or by the signature of the
treasurer or an assistant secretary. 

THE
TREASURER 

Section
10. The treasurer shall have the custody of the corporate funds and securities and shall keep full and accurate accounts of receipts
and disbursements in books belonging to the corporation and shall deposit all moneys and other valuable effects in the name and to the
credit of the corporation in such depositories as may be designated by the board of directors.

STOCK
CERTIFICATES AND UNCERTIFICATED SHARES 

Section
1. Every stockholder shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by or in the name of the corporation by officers or agents designated
by the board of directors for the purpose, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the corporation; provided, however, that the
board of directors may authorize the issuance of uncertificated shares of some or all of any or all classes or series of the corporation s
stock. Any such issuance of uncertificated shares shall have no effect on existing certificates for shares until such certificates are
surrendered to the corporation, or on the respective rights and obligations of the stockholders. When the corporation is authorized to
issue shares of more than one class or more than one series of any class, there shall be set forth upon the face or back of the certificate,
or the certificate shall have a statement that the corporation will furnish to any stockholders upon request and without charge, a full
or summary statement of the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the various classes
of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such rights, and, if the corporation shall be authorized
to issue only special stock, such certificate shall set forth in full or summarize the rights of the holders of such stock. 

Section
2. Whenever any certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and by a registrar, then
a facsimile of the signatures of the officers or agents of the corporation may be printed or lithographed upon such certificate in lieu
of the actual signatures. In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have
been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of
death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate
or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed
such certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon, had not ceased to be the officer
or officers of such corporation. The board of directors may designate the corporation s transfer agent as an agent of the corporation
with authority to sign the certificate in the name of the corporation certifying the number of shares of stock owned by a holder of the
corporation s stock. 

LOST
CERTIFICATES 

Section
3. The board of directors may direct a new certificate or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore
issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
the certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or uncertificated shares, the board
of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed
certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or give the corporation
a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost or destroyed. 

TRANSFER
OF STOCK 

Section
4. Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied
by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate
to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Upon written notice to the corporation
or to a transfer agent of the corporation from the holder of record of any uncertificated shares of stock requesting a registration of
transfer of such uncertificated shares to another person, accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer,
and such documentary stamps as may be required by law, it shall be the duty of the corporation to register such uncertificated shares
of stock in the name of such other person on the books of the corporation as the successor holder of record of such uncertificated shares
of stock. Every such transfer of stock shall be entered on the stock book of the corporation which shall be kept at its principal office
or by its registrar duly appointed. 

CLOSING
OF TRANSFER BOOKS 

Section
5. The directors may prescribe a period not exceeding sixty days prior to any meeting of the stockholders during which no transfer of
stock on the books of the corporation may be made, or may fix a day not more than sixty days prior to the holding of any such meeting
as the day as of which stock-holders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting shall be determined; and only stockholders of
record on such day shall be entitled to notice or to vote at such meeting. 

REGISTERED
STOCKHOLDERS 

Section
6. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive
dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares,
and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person,
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Nevada.
