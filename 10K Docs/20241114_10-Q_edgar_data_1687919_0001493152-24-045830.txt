Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis and Plan of Operation 

This
10 Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general
economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events. 

Overview 

Forge
Innovation Development Corp. is a development stage company and was incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2016. The Company s
primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including the purchase and sale of real estate, targeting properties
primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own, and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties. Our
activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing
financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to
homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres in the city
of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather than getting involved in protracted
negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit. 

On
August 17, 2020, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, Forge Network Inc, in the State of California. As of September 30,
2024, we have not generated any income from the subsidiary due to our business strategy adjustment. 

On
March 24, 2023, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement between Forge Innovation Development Corp. (the Company or the
 Buyer and Legend Investment Management, LLC Legend LLC or the Seller ), the Company acquired
77.3 of Legend LLC s 66 ownership of Legend International Investment, LP Legend LP ). Legend LP owns 100 of Mission
Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the Property located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California.
The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated
on a 4.51acre site. 

A
relative of the President of the Company has significant influence of the Seller s management, therefore the acquisition is being
treated as a related party transaction. The Company acquired 51 interest of Legend LP from Legend LLC in exchanged for 1,967,143 common
stocks of the Company, valued at 0.70 per share for a total purchase price of 1,377,000, which equals 51 of Legend LP s approximate
net value of 2,700,000 based on (1) the Property s valuation appraisal report dated on February 20, 2023, (2) Legend LP s
net book value as of February 28, 2023, and (3) the loan agreement to Legend LP by a third-party lender effective on March 23, 2023.
After the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 51 of Legend LP and the Seller will own 15 of Legend LP. 

Results
of Operation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had total rental income of 178,380, as compared to 132,760 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, an increase of 45,620, or 34 . The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP in March 2023, and the
increased rentable offices since the acquisition of Legend LP. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of 72,256 and 50,499,
respectively. The increase of general and administrative expense is mainly due to the increase of property tax. During the same period
of 2023 and 2024, the depreciation expense increased from 68,884 to 78,167, and property operating expense increased from 40,354 to
 44,509. The increase in property operating expenses is not considered as significant.

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had interest expense and other, net of 93,669 and 128,520 occurred
from the loans of Legend LP, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to the change of borrower for the loans of
Legend LP in April 2024. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had share-based compensation of nil and 494,027, respectively. The
Company issued 2,800,000 shares of common stocks under its 2023 Equity Incentive Plan after the first quarter of 2023. 

Results
of Operation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total rental income of 490,498, as compared to 310,770 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 179,728, or 58 . The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP in March 2023, and the increased
rentable offices since the acquisition of Legend LP. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total management income of nil, as compared to 45,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP in March 2023, which eliminated to recognize property management
income from Legend LP as intercompany transaction since April 2023. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of 246,141 and 148,890,
respectively. During the same period of 2023 and 2024, the depreciation expense increase from 190,731 to 234,694, and property operating
expense increased from 92,364 to 122,139. The increases in these expense categories were mainly due to the acquisition of Legend LP
and subsequently increased rentable offices, which leads more general and administrative expenses, depreciation expense and property
operating related expenses. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had interest expense and other, net of 411,771 and 333,283 occurred
from the loans of Legend LP, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had share-based compensation of 928,986 and 536,986, respectively. The
increase is due to the adoption of 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and the issuance of 2,800,000 shares of common stocks under the plan to
the Company s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan after the first quarter of 2023. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company had gain on bargain purchase of 487,688 and nil on the acquisition of
Legend LP, respectively. 

Equity
and Capital Resources 

We
have incurred losses since inception of our business in 2016, except for current quarter, and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of 3,716,913. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 28,244 and a negative working capital of 1,144,081, compared to cash
of 4,892 and a negative working capital of 482,138 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the working capital deficiency was primarily
due to cash used to pay for operating expenses and loans and interest of Legend. 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations and execute the business plan of the Company
in order to meet its operating needs on a timely basis. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be
sufficient to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets,
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

14 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful
and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition.
