 cannabis dispensaries and cannabis production and cultivation facilities across Illinois and Massachusetts. The Company's "MISSION" branded dispensaries are located in: Georgetown, MA; Worcester, MA; South Shore (Chicago), IL; Calumet City, IL; and Norridge, IL. In the state of Massachusetts, the Company has a cultivation facility in Worcester, and cultivation and production facilities in Georgetown and Holliston. In the state of Illinois, the Company has a cultivation and production facility in Matteson. The Company also sells non-THC hemp derived products across the United States. As part of its corporate segment, subsidiaries of 4Front Ventures lease real estate and sell equipment and supplies to cannabis producers in the state of Washington. Together, 4Front Ventures and its subsidiaries are referred to in this report as 4Front or the Company. 
 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of 4Front and all entities in which the Company either has a controlling voting interest or is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company has prepared these statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and U.S. GAAP. Certain information related to the organization, significant accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed, or omitted. 
 
 In the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise noted below. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results you can expect for a full year. These financials should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of million and working capital deficit of million. The Company incurred net losses from continuing operations of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt with respect to the Company s ability to meet its obligations for at least one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, and therefore, to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company plans to continue to fund its operations through cash generated from sales and is deploying its capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues and earnings over both the immediate and near term. Capital reserves are being utilized for capital expenditures and improvements in existing facilities, product development and marketing, as well as customer, supplier and investor and industry relations. The Company has raised capital as needed, however there is no guarantee the Company will be able to continue to raise funds in the same manner it has historically.

 Goodwill 

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is related to the Massachusetts segment in which there is accumulated impairment within this segment. 
 
 Goodwill and infinite lived assets are assessed on an annual basis for impairment, or more frequently, if circumstances indicate an impairment to the carrying value may have occurred. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets (licenses), are recoverable and there were no events or circumstances that indicated impairment. However, if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the assets would be reviewed for impairment. 
 
 Refer to Note 17 for discussion of intangible assets and goodwill related to the Company's operations in California classified as discontinued operations.

 See Note 11 for warrants classified within equity.

If 4Front obtains a bona fide offer from a third party to refinance the loan within from the amendment date, the lender will have the option to match the proposed terms of the offer or keep the loan in force; upon exercise of either option, the lender's warrant coverage will be reduced from to of the loan balance divided by the exercise price as of the current maturity date. If 4Front obtains permitted secured debt senior to the loan up to million, of the warrants will become exercisable by cashless exercise. If 4Front obtains permitted secured debt senior to the loan in excess of million (up to the million maximum), of the warrants will become exercisable by cashless exercise. The warrants met the criteria in ASC 480 due to the variability of the number of issuable shares, and are therefore classified as liabilities at fair value with changes being reported through the statement of operations.

 In connection with the senior secured credit facility with Alt Debt II, LP, the Company entered into a restricted stock unit RSU agreement (the RSU Agreement dated November 13, 2023 wherein the Company granted RSUs to the lender at an issue price of CAD . Each RSU represents an unsecured promise to issue SVS upon the earliest of certain distribution events. If at the time of the distribution event, the number of SVS underlying the RSUs is less than of the fully diluted SVS of the Company, an additional number of RSUs will be issuable to the lender at the closing market price on the Canadian Securities Exchange on the trading day prior to issuance. 
 
 On September 20, 2024, the RSU Agreement dated November 13, 2023 was voided and the Company entered into a new RSU Agreement dated September 20, 2024 wherein the Company granted RSUs to the lender at an issue price of CAD . Each RSU represents an unsecured promise to issue SVS upon the earliest of certain distribution events. If at the time of the distribution event, the number of SVS underlying the RSUs is less than of the fully diluted SVS of the Company, an additional number of RSUs will be issuable to the lender at the closing market price on the Canadian Securities Exchange on the trading day prior to issuance. The additional RSUs met the criteria in ASC 480 due to the variability of the number of issuable shares, and are therefore classified as liabilities at fair value with changes being reported through the statement of operations. The fair value of the RSUs classified as liabilities was determined using the Company's share price which is considered a Level 1 input on the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 On January 29, 2024, the Company entered into an RSU agreement with LI Lending, LLC providing that, in the event of a financing by the Company at less than C per SVS on or before July 29, 2024, LI Lending, LLC shall be entitled to receive a number of shares necessary to restore it to of the voting interests of the Company. The RSUs met the criteria in ASC 480 due to the variability of the number of issuable shares, and are therefore classified as liabilities at fair value with changes being reported through the statement of operations. No financing that would trigger the RSU had occurred as of July 29, 2024 and the RSU was forfeited as of September 30, 2024. As of the issuance date and September 30, 2024, the fair value of the RSUs classified as liabilities was determined to be nil.

 Note 13: ) ) ) Income tax benefit (expense) ) 
 
 The Company has computed its provision for income taxes under the discrete method which treats the year-to-date period as if it were the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. The discrete method is applied when application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. At this time, there is a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the Company s annual pre-tax income and significant non-deductible expenses so the Company cannot reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. 
 
 Due to its cannabis operations, the Company is subject to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 280E under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E. Therefore, the effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income and provides for effective tax rates that are well in excess of statutory tax rates. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions and is subject to examination of its income tax returns by tax authorities in these jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these returns. The corporate statute of limitations for these jurisdictions remains open for the 2019 tax year to the present. Prior to July 31, 2019, the Company was treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and tax income and losses generated from operations were passed through to the Company s individual members.

Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenue from Sale of Goods 15,292 20,110 (4,818) 24 Real Estate Income 1,840 2,892 (1,052) 36 Total Revenues 17,132 23,002 (5,870) 26 Cost of Goods Sold (13,468) (13,722) 254 2 Gross Profit 3,664 9,280 (5,616) 61 Total Operating Expense 9,031 23,579 (14,548) (62) Loss from Continuing Operations (5,367) (14,299) 8,932 62 Total Other Expense, net (1,096) (16,328) 15,232 (93) Net Loss from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes (6,463) (30,627) 24,164 79 Income Tax Benefit 4,199 (4,199) 100 Net Loss from Continuing Operations (6,463) (26,428) 19,965 76 Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes 60 (35,668) 35,728 100 Net Loss (6,403) (62,096) 55,693 90 
 
 Revenue from Sale of Goods 
 
 Revenue from sale of goods related to continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.3 million, representing a decrease of 4.8 million or 24 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the segment discussion below for specific revenue drivers. 
 
 Real Estate Income 
 
 Real estate income from leasing cannabis production facilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.8 million, versus 2.9 million recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 1.1 million was largely attributable to lower rent billings in accordance with the lease agreements amended in fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Total revenue from continuing operations in the reportable segments from which we operate were as follows: 
 
 30 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Illinois 7,255 9,058 (1,803) 20 Massachusetts 7,883 10,455 (2,572) 25 Corporate 1,994 3,489 (1,495) 43 Total Net Revenues 17,132 23,002 (5,870) 26 
 
 Net revenues for the Illinois segment were 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 1.8 million or 20 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to overall softness within the retail portion of this segment as a result of increased competition and price compression as the cannabis market matures in Illinois. 
 
 Net revenues for the Massachusetts segment were 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 2.6 million or 25 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to overall softness within the retail portion of this segment as a result of increased competition and continued price compression. 
 
 Net revenues for the corporate segment includes the sale of CBD products to third-party consumers and the leasing of real estate and sale of equipment and supplies to cannabis producers in the state of Washington, which were 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease of 1.5 million or 43 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in real estate income as described above. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.5 million, resulting in a decrease of 0.3 million or 2 when compared to 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold of 2 was not commensurate with the decrease in revenue from sale of goods of 24 quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Matteson Facility during the fiscal third quarter of 2024, resulting in lease costs associated with the Matteson Facility being recognized in cost of goods sold, which were previously reported in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.7 million or 21 of revenue, compared to 9.3 million or 40 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenue outpacing the decrease in cost of goods sold as described above. 
 
 Total Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and gain/loss on disposal. Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.0 million, representing a decrease of 14.5 million or 62 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 12.5 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Specifically, the Company saw a decrease in rent and lease related expenses of 3.7 million, a decrease in salaries and benefits of 3.2 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of 6.5 million . Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further detail on selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company recognized a gain on disposal of 0.6 million upon the completion of the sale of Om of Medicine and 0.6 million upon the sale of equipment during the current quarter. 

31 

Total Other Expense, net 
 
 Other expense consists primarily of interest expense, change in fair value of derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other expenses. Total other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 million, compared to 16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 15.2 million was primarily due a decrease in interest expense of 1.2 million from prior year as a result of debt amendments subsequent to the fiscal third quarter of 2023, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.34 million during the current quarter related to the amendment of the Facility on September 20, 2024. In addition, the Company recognized a gain on changes in fair value of derivative liability of 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus a loss of 11.9 million in the comparative prior period. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 Net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.5 million, compared to 26.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss from continuing operations of 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of 12.5 million coupled with a gain on changes in fair value of derivative liability of 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus a loss of 11.9 million in the comparative prior period. This was offset by an income tax benefit of 4.2 million in the comparative prior quarter, versus none in the current period. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenue from Sale of Goods 49,005 67,709 (18,704) 28 Real Estate Income 5,625 8,747 (3,122) 36 Total Revenues 54,630 76,456 (21,826) 29 Cost of Goods Sold (36,053) (38,884) 2,831 7 Gross Profit 18,577 37,572 (18,995) 51 Total Operating Expense 33,110 52,201 (19,091) 37 Loss from Continuing Operations (14,533) (14,629) 96 1 Total Other Expense, net (15,520) (24,116) 8,596 (36) Net Loss from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes (30,053) (38,745) 8,692 22 Income Tax Expense (818) 818 100 Net Loss from Continuing Operations (30,053) (39,563) 9,510 24 Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes 330 (45,389) 45,719 101 Net Loss (29,723) (84,952) 55,229 65 
 
 Revenue from Sale of Goods 
 
 Revenue from sale of goods related to continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 49.0 million, representing a decrease of 18.7 million or 28 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the segment discussion below for specific revenue drivers. 
 32 

Real Estate Income 
 
 Real estate income from leasing cannabis production facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.6 million, versus 8.7 million recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 3.1 million was largely attributable to lower rent billings in accordance with the lease agreements amended in fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Total revenue from continuing operations in the reportable segments from which we operate were as follows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Illinois 23,969 29,172 (5,203) 18 Massachusetts 24,117 34,794 (10,677) 31 Corporate 6,544 12,490 (5,946) 48 Total Net Revenues 54,630 76,456 (21,826) 29 
 
 Net revenues for the Illinois segment were 24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 5.2 million or 18 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net revenues for the Massachusetts segment were 24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 10.7 million or 31 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decline in revenue from sales of goods in both Illinois and Massachusetts were primarily attributed to increased competition and price competition which impacted the retail portion within each segment. In addition, significant regulatory and tax burdens have impacted financial performance and profit margins. Net revenues for the corporate segment were 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.9 million or 48 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to the decrease in real estate income as described above. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.1 million, resulting in a decrease of 2.8 million or 7 when compared to 38.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold of 7 was not commensurate with the decrease in revenue from sale of goods of 28 year-over-year primarily due to the commencement of operations at the Matteson Facility during the fiscal third quarter of 2024, resulting in lease costs associated with the Matteson Facility being recognized in cost of goods sold, which were previously reported in selling, general and administrative expenses. This increase in overhead resulted in higher incremental costs to cultivate and manufacture cannabis and cannabis derived goods, resulting in a higher cost of goods per unit sold. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 18.6 million or 34 of revenue, compared to 37.6 million or 49 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenue outpacing the decrease in cost of goods sold as described above. 

33 

Total Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and gain/loss on disposal. Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.1 million, representing a decrease of 19.1 million or 37 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 16.7 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Specifically, the Company saw a decrease in rent and lease related expenses of 5.8 million, a decrease in salaries and benefits of 2.7 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of 6.9 million. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further detail on selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company recognized a gain on disposal of 0.6 million upon the completion of the sale of Om of Medicine and 0.6 million upon the sale of equipment during the current period. 
 
 Total Other Expense, net 
 
 Other expense consists primarily of interest expense, change in fair value of derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other expenses. Total other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.5 million, compared to 24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 8.6 million was primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of 11.8 million from the conversion of 23.0 million of the senior secured debt into 244,680,852 SVS on January 29, 2024 and a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.3 million from the amendment of the Facility on September 20, 2024. This was offset by a decrease in interest expense of 3.2 million from prior year as a result of debt amendments as a result of debt amendments subsequent to the fiscal third quarter of 2023 and a decrease in other expense of 2.5 million primarily due to an accrual for cultivation taxes in the state of Illinois recognized in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. In addition, the Company recognized a gain on changes in fair value of derivative liability of 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a loss of 11.9 million in the prior year. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 Net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.1 million, compared to 39.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss from continuing operations of 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit offset by the decreases in operating expense and other expense as described above. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial and Performance Measures 
 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate the Company s financial performance. Management uses the non-GAAP measurement of adjusted EBITDA, which we believe reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as it facilitates comparing financial results across accounting periods. We also believe this non-GAAP financial measure enables investors to evaluate the Company s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. This non-GAAP financial measures may also exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of the Company s ongoing operating results. As there are no standardized methods of calculating non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by others. Accordingly, non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

34 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as detailed below. This measure provides investors with additional information to measure the Company s financial performance, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period. The Company s management uses Adjusted EBITDA (a) as a measure of operating performance, (b) for planning and forecasting in future periods, and (c) in communications with the Company s board of directors concerning the Company s financial performance. 
 
 The Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation and should not be used by investors as a substitute or alternative to net income or any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, management believes Adjusted EBITDA should be used to supplement the Company s financial measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP to understand the trends affecting the business. 
 
 Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations to using non-GAAP measures as an analytical tool are (a) they do not reflect the Company s interest income and expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company s debt, (b) they do not reflect future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, and (c) although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 
 The prior year reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted for consistency with current year presentation. These adjustments did not affect net loss, revenues and stockholders equity. 
 
 35 

The following table reconciles Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (GAAP) (6,403) (62,096) (29,723) (84,952) Less: Net (income) loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (60) 35,668 (330) 45,389 Net loss from continuing operations (6,463) (26,428) (30,053) (39,563) Adjusted for: Interest income (5) 21 (15) Interest expense (1) 
 7,053 7,628 19,377 22,354 Income tax expense (4,199) 818 Depreciation and amortization (2) 
 2,031 2,382 6,368 7,128 EBITDA Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) 2,616 (20,596) (4,323) (9,263) Share-based compensation (3) 
 688 3,678 2,594 4,912 Change in fair value of derivative liability (2,403) 11,931 (4,033) 11,931 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,343 13,095 (Gain) Loss on disposal (1,213) 160 (1,208) 160 Adjusted EBITDA Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) 1,031 (4,827) 6,125 7,740 
 
 (1) For the current period, interest expense includes interest related to leases of 4.9 million and 13.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Prior year amounts of 4.3 million and 12.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Non-cash interest expense related to leases was previously presented as a reconciling item from EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP). 
 (2) For the current period, depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization related to leases of 1.0 million and 2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Prior year amounts of 1.0 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Non-cash amortization expense related to leases was previously presented as a reconciling item from EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP). 
 (3) Although share-based compensation is an important component of employee and executive compensation, determining the fair value of share-based compensation involves a high degree of judgment and as a result the Company excludes share-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA because its believes that the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon future exercise or termination of any related share-based compensation award. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, Net Loss. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as compared to Net Loss, the closest comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Company, excludes from Net Loss: 
 
 Interest income and expense, including interest expense related to leases; 
 Current income tax expense; 
 36 

Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, including amortization of leases; 
 Non-cash share-based compensation expense; 
 Non-cash changes in fair value of derivative liability; 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt; and 
 Loss on disposal of assets. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had total current liabilities of 112.9 million and 104.0 million, respectively, and current assets of 38.1 million and 33.9 million, respectively, to meet current obligations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficit of 74.8 million compared to 70.1 million. The decline in working capital of 4.7 million was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable of 4.8 million, an increase in taxes payable of 2.7 million, offset by an increase in inventory of 2.5 million resulting from the commencement and continued scaling of operations at the Matteson Facility during the fiscal third quarter of 2024. 
 
 The Company is an emerging growth company. It is generating cash from sales and is deploying its capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues and earnings over both the immediate and near term. Capital reserves are being utilized for capital expenditures and improvements in existing facilities, product development and marketing, as well as customer, supplier and investor and industry relations. Historically, the Company has raised capital as needed however there is no guarantee the Company will be able to continue to raise funds in the same manner it has historically. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash Flows from discontinued operations are separately presented on the statement of cash flow for each operating, investing, and financing section of the statement. For liquidity purposes, the focus of this section is on the cash flow from continuing operations which is expected to affect future liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million as compared to 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross profit, offset by the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a direct result of management's decisive action to streamline operations and reduce its cash burn. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Continuing Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in continuing investing activities was 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 million as compared to 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment related to the completion of the Matteson facility in February 2024 and the construction of the Norridge dispensary, which opened in May 2024. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Continuing Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in continuing financing activities was 2.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 4.1 million as compared to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in repayments of notes payable resulting from amendments to its debt agreements subsequent to the fiscal third quarter of 2023. 
 
 37 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 We review new accounting standards as issued. Although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of our previous fiscal year may be applicable to the Company, we have not identified any standards that we believe merit further discussion. We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Material Weaknesses 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control 
 
 The Company did not fully design and implement effective control activities based on the criteria established in the COSO framework. The Company has identified deficiencies that constitute a material weakness, either individually or in the aggregate. This material weakness is attributable to the following factors: 
 
 We did not have sufficient accounting staff resources to timely perform closing, review and audit related procedures during the financial close process. 

38 

Due to the existence of the above material weakness, management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. This material weakness creates a possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company continues to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and is committed to ensuring that such controls are designed and operating effectively. The Company is implementing process and control improvements to address the above material weakness as follows: 
 
 The Company will obtain additional resources, both in accounting staff and related technology, needed to timely perform closing and audit related procedures and align identified resources. 
 
 The material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. The Company is working to have the material weaknesses remediated as soon as possible. However, there is no assurance that the remediation will be fully effective. As described above, the material weakness has not been fully remediated as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q. If these remediation efforts do not prove effective and control deficiencies and material weaknesses persist or occur in the future, the accuracy and timing of the Company s financial reporting may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 On May 9, 2023, Florival LLC Florival sued 4Front Ventures in the California Superior Court for the County of Santa Cruz. The lawsuit alleged 4Front Ventures had breached an agreement with Florival under which Island Global Holdings, Inc. Island ), a subsidiary of the Company, agreed to purchase the membership interests of licensed cannabis cultivator Gold Coast Gardens, LLC. Florival claimed damages of 0.85 million. 4Front Ventures denied it had any direct liability under the agreement, which was executed two years before 4Front Ventures acquisition of Island, and asserted an unclean hands defense on behalf of both 4Front Ventures and Island based on Florival s inequitable conduct during the litigation. On November 7, 2023, the court entered summary judgment against 4Front Ventures and Island. The Company has appealed the decision. Management has accrued 0.9 million related to this matter as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On September 29, 2023, Teichman Enterprises, Inc. Teichman sued 4Front California Capital Holdings, Inc. 4Front CA ), a subsidiary of the Company, and 4Front Ventures in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleged 4Front CA had breached a lease agreement ending January 31, 2029 and 4Front Ventures breached its guarantee of the lease. Teichman seeks damages for unpaid rent, marketing expenses, and other amounts totaling 15.5 million. 4Front CA and 4Front Ventures denied the allegations in the complaint and denied that Teichman was entitled to the full amount of damages claimed due to Teichman's obligation to mitigate. The case is in discovery. Based on management's review of the matter, the Company has accrued 2.7 million associated with this legal liability as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Apart from the foregoing and ongoing legal proceedings, from time to time, we may be subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that are routine and incidental to our business. Although some of the legal proceedings set forth herein may result in adverse decisions or settlements, management believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
