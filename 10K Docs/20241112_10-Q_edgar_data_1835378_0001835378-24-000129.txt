 Should one or more of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to:

 operating segment and this segment is the only reporting unit. 
 ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and other ASC 350 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually and, in certain circumstances, between annual tests. The accounting guidance gives the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed. 
 The Company elects to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company experienced a decline in its stock price resulting in its market capitalization being less than the carrying value of its reporting unit. Thus, the Company performed quantitative assessments of the Company s reporting unit. The fair value was determined based on the market approach. The market approach utilizes the Company's market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium. Market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of common stock outstanding by the market price of its common stock. The control premium is determined by utilizing publicly available data from studies for similar transactions of public companies. As a result of this assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of million during the three months ended June 30, 2023. impairment was recognized during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Separately acquired intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost including directly attributable costs. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
 Customer relationships and acquired technology are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets; approximately years and years, respectively. Amortization of customer relationships and acquired technology is presented within depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Legal contingencies 
 On March 4, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by the Nielsen Company (US) LLC against TV Squared, alleging infringement of US Patent No. 10.063.078. On June 1, 2022, TV Squared moved to transfer the case to the Southern District of New York, which was granted on January 18, 2023. On March 23, 2023, TV Squared moved for judgment on the pleadings that the asserted claims of the Nielsen patent are invalid because they are patent ineligible under 35 U.S.C. 101. The Court has not yet ruled on TV Squared s motion. While the motion has remained pending, discovery commenced. The Court also conducted a hearing to construe the patent claims on January 10, 2024, but has not issued a ruling. 
 On April 15, 2024, the Court issued an order to stay the case for ninety ) days and to extend various deadlines as set out below, to allow the parties to continue settlement negotiations without incurring the substantial costs associated with the impending close of fact discovery and deadlines for expert reports. The parties agreed that the stay will apply to all interim deadlines, including the service of and responses and objections to written discovery. On July 2, 2024 the Court issued an order to extend the stay for an extra one hundred and twenty ) days, and on October 23, 2024, the Court extended the stay for an additional eighty ) days. 
 In the October 23, 2024 order, the Court set the date for the close of fact discovery as May 2, 2025 and the date for close of expert discovery as September 9, 2025. 
 No trial date has yet been set and the plaintiff has not specified the amount sought in the litigation. Given the uncertainty of litigation and the preliminary stage of the lawsuit, the Company is unable at this time to give an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss, if any, which might result to the Company if the outcome in such litigation was unfavorable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a loss contingency.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our audited financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations, estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may be updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including under the heading Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Company Overview 
 We are an enterprise cloud software platform for the creation, delivery, measurement, and optimization of advertising across connected TV CTV ), mobile and desktop environments. We provide critical technology infrastructure for many

Table of Contents 

 of the world s largest brands, agencies, and publishers, and empower them to create ad-supported TV experiences people love. Our vision, that television should be open for everyone, and controlled by no one, is at the heart of how we operate our business as an independent platform, and as a strategic, trusted partner for our clients. 
 Our technology is purpose-built for CTV, with a comprehensive view of the full ecosystem, including linear TV, mobile, and desktop channels. Our cloud-based platform tightly integrates with the highly fragmented advertising technology and media ecosystem, and includes three key solutions: Ad Serving, Creative Personalization, and Measurement. We count many of the world s largest brand advertisers as customers, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, CVS Pharmacy, Kellogg s, Mercedes-Benz, Target, Sanofi, and more. As of September 30, 2024, over 50 of the top 200 large advertisers, by TV US advertising spend according to MediaRadar leverage our platform. We are also trusted partners of the largest streaming platform providers in the world, including Disney, Hulu, ESPN, NBCU, and Paramount, and we work closely with top advertising agencies and agency holding companies such as WPP, Publicis Groupe, Omnicom Group, Interpublic Group of Cos., Dentsu Inc., Havas Group, Horizon Media, and The Stagwell Group. Our clients are diversified across all major industry verticals, including consumer packaged goods, pharmaceutical and healthcare, retail, financial services, automotive and technology. We serve customers globally across over 50 countries, with most of our customers located in the US. 
 Our revenue growth closely correlates with the growth of CTV advertising. CTV accounted for 58 and 55 of all video impressions served by Innovid during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, this represented a year-over-year increase of 13 in CTV video impressions served by Innovid. The balance of video impressions served by Innovid during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was attributed to mobile, 32 and 35 , respectively, and PC, 11 and 10 , respectively. In the third quarter of 2024, video impressions volume decreased by 2 for mobile and increased by 5 for desktop as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Transactions 
 Innovid Corp. was originally incorporated as ION Acquisition Corp. 2 Ltd. ION ), a special purpose acquisition company, on November 23, 2020, and Innovid Corp. was the surviving entity following the completion of its merger with ION on November 30, 2021 (the Transaction ). 
 On February 28, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of TV Squared Limited by way of stock purchase agreement Stock Purchase Agreement ). The Company acquired all the equity of TVS for an aggregate amount of 100.0 million in cash, 11,549,465 shares of the Company common stock at fair value of 3.80 per share, and the issuance of 949,893 fully vested stock options of the Company at a weighted average fair value of 3.49, subject to certain adjustments as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such management estimates and assumptions used are related, but not limited to, income tax uncertainties, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation, as well as the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in business combinations. The Company s management believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions used as reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Global Events 
 A number of our employees, including some senior employees and two of our directors are residents of Israel. As of today, the Company s business operations have not been disrupted to any significant extent and the Company does not anticipate any material impact to operations going forward amidst the war in Israel. All of our infrastructure and internal networks are cloud-based and are located outside of Israel. Key systems and IT functions are distributed globally, and our customer care and sales teams are situated mainly in the US, the UK and Argentina. Our office in Israel is primarily a research and development facility and is one of three of our worldwide research and development facilities.

 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 There are several factors that have impacted, and we believe, may continue to impact our results of operations and growth. 
 These factors include: 
 Continued market demand. Our performance depends on continued global demand across the advertising ecosystem for independent third-party ad serving, personalization, and measurement of digital ads. Advertisers, programmatic platforms, social media channels and digital publishers are collectively placing increased emphasis on the quality and effectiveness of digital ad spend across all channels, formats and devices. 
 Our growth is primarily driven by CTV, the fastest growing segment of digital ad spend, and our results depend on our ability to monetize continued market growth of CTV ad spend. 
 Growth of volume of CTV ad impressions of existing customers. Our results also depend on our ability to retain our existing customers and on our customers continued investment in CTV advertising. Customer retention will continue to impact our results as TV investment continues to shift from linear to CTV and the volume of CTV impressions grows. 
 Upsell of additional services. An additional contributor to our efforts in expanding revenue generated by our customers is our investment in cross-selling our solutions. We cross-sell our personalized creative solutions to primarily ad serving customers, who, for example, begin using our services with standard digital video ads and then introduce personalized formats over time. We also cross-sell our advanced measurement solutions, which provide real-time metrics to inform optimization of TV campaigns while in the market. The success of these efforts will impact our results of operations. 
 New client accounts. We intend to continue targeting new brand, media agency and digital publisher customers who are currently utilizing solutions provided by our competitors or point solutions. Our results of operations will be impacted by our ability to attract new customers. 
 Seasonality. We experience fluctuations in revenue that coincide with seasonal fluctuations in the digital ad spending of our customers, in particular television ad spending patterns. Advertisers typically allocate the largest portion of their media budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. As a result, the fourth quarter of the year typically reflects our highest level of revenue while the first quarter typically reflects our lowest level of revenue. However, this traditional seasonality may also be impacted by certain external factors or major events that also impact traditional television advertising patterns, such as supply chain disruptions and silicon/chip shortages. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole and for these seasonal fluctuations in ad spend to impact quarter-over-quarter results. We believe that the year-over-year comparison of results more appropriately reflects the overall performance of our business. 
 
 Global Markets 
 The majority of our clients operate at a significant scale. Innovid serves customers globally through a delivery footprint including the US, APAC, EMEA, and LATAM. During the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 8 , respectively, of Innovid's revenue was generated by our customers outside of the US. 
 We continue to service international markets to meet the needs of our global customer base and to accelerate new customer acquisition in key geographies outside of the US. We believe our continuing ability to service international markets will impact our results of operations. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate most of our revenue from digital ad solutions via our cloud-based ad serving platform to advertisers, media agencies and publishers. We focus on standard, interactive and data driven digital video advertising. Ad serving services relate to utilizing our platform to serve advertising impressions to various digital publishers across CTV, mobile, and desktop.

 InnovidXP, our cloud based cross-platform TV Ad measurement solution measures the efficiency of CTV advertising and in-flight optimizations for TV marketers. We will continue to invest in advanced measurement capability and provide solutions to advertisers, streaming platforms and agencies as their needs evolve in the highly fragmented CTV ecosystem. 
 We provide creative services for the design and development of interactive data-driven and dynamic ad formats by adding data, interactivity and dynamic features to standard ad units. 
 We generate the majority of our revenue from the sale and delivery of our products within the US. For information with respect to sales by geographic markets, refer to Note 10, Segment Reporting to the condensed consolidated financial statements included under Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 We anticipate that revenue from our US sales will continue to constitute a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods.

 Revenue 
 The overall growth and scaling of CTV was the key driver of Innovid s revenue growth in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As TV ad spend continues to shift from linear to CTV, we continue to benefit from the natural volume growth of CTV impressions we deliver for our existing and new customers. We have driven consistent positive net revenue retention of our core client base, largely through increased CTV advertising volume, as legacy TV budgets migrate from linear TV to CTV.

 Three months ended September 30, (In thousands) (Increase) decrease 2024 2023 Amount Taxes on income (5,823) (1,301) (4,522) 348 
 The Company recorded net benefits for incomes taxes of 5.8 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 502.8 and 32.3 , respectively. The benefit increase in the third quarter of 2024 results from a change in the Company s full year forecast and the effects of using the interim tax reporting methodology provided under ASC 740-270 where the Company uses a forecasted effective tax rate against current year-to-date results.

The increase in year-to-date 2024 tax expense results from growing profitability of the global business and associated higher current tax expense, non-deductibility of stock compensation expenses in the US and Israel, the recognition of uncertain tax positions that previously offset against unrecognized deferred tax assets, and as discussed above, the effects of using the interim tax reporting methodology provided under ASC 740-270. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through utilization of cash generated from operations, as well as borrowings under our credit facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 35.0 million and net working capital, consisting of current assets less current liabilities, of 59.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 194.9 million, 76.0 million thereof results from the cumulative accretion of preferred stock to redemption value prior to the conversion of all preferred stock into our common stock upon the closing of the Transaction. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated net cash provided by operating activities, together with available borrowings under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected. We are closely monitoring the effect that current economic conditions may have on our working capital requirements. To date, the war in Israel has not had a material negative impact on our cash flow or liquidity. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors. 
 On November 6, 2024, our board of directors authorized the Company to implement a stock repurchase program to purchase up to 20.0 million of our common stock. Subject to the final terms of the program, it is expected that repurchases would be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases determined at the Company s discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 or Rule10b-5-1 under the Exchange Act. This program is not expected to obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at the discretion of our board of directors and the Company may decline to move forward with the implementation of any repurchase plan.

 Revolving Line of Credit 
 On August 4, 2022, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Innovid LLC and TV Squared Inc, entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the 2022 A R Agreement ), to increase the revolving line of credit from 15.0 million to 50.0 million (the New Revolving Credit Facility ). The 2022 A R Agreement and the New Revolving Credit Facility were amended by a First Loan Modification Agreement dated August 2, 2023 (the 2023 Modification Agreement and a Second Loan Modification Agreement dated June 26, 2024 (the 2024 Modification Agreement ). The interest for the New Revolving Credit Facility is payable monthly in arrears. The New Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at an annual rate that is the greater of (a) WSJ Prime Rate plus 0.25 or (b) 4.25 , on the aggregate outstanding balance. Additional fees include 0.20 per annum of the average unused portion of the New Revolving Credit Facility to be paid quarterly in arrears. The maturity date of the 2022 A R Agreement, as amended, is June 30, 2027. The New Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain customary conditions precedent to the credit extension as stated in the 2022 A R Agreement and is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets and continues to place limitations on indebtedness, liens, distributions, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and acquisitions, all as defined in the agreement. 
 The New Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with all covenants, primarily maintaining an adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.30 to 1.00. As defined in the 2022 A R Agreement adjusted quick ratio is the ratio of (a) quick assets to (b) current liabilities minus the current portion of deferred revenue. Quick assets are calculated as unrestricted cash plus accounts receivable, net, and is determined according to US GAAP. We are also required to maintain the minimum quarterly adjusted EBITDA as defined in the 2022 A R Agreement, as amended, if the Company does not maintain the quarterly adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.50 to 1.00. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 The Company utilizes the credit line on an as needed basis. In January 2024, the Company repaid 20.0 million under the credit line and has not subsequently drawn from it. 
 We recognize interest expense in finance income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial and 0.4 million, respectively. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 0.4 million and 0.4 million, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.2 million and 1.1 million, respectively. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 1.1 million and 1.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 11,915 7,437 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (6,916) 1,887 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (19,688) 772 Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (321) (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (15,010) 10,096 
 Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by growth in our operations, increases or decreases in collections from our customers and payments to our vendors, as well as increases in personnel related expenses as we scale our business. The timing of cash receipts from customers and payments to vendors and providers can significantly impact our cash flows from operating activities. Seasonality is expected to impact cash flows from operating activities quarterly. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Cash provided by operating activities is calculated by adjusting our net loss for changes in working capital, excluding non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and change in fair value of warrants. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 11.9 million. The non-cash charges, primarily stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization, offset the net loss and provided 10.7 million in cash. Collections on our trade receivables, the timing of prepaid software subscriptions, other accrued expenses and vendor payments together provided 5.8 million in cash. The timing of payments to employees used 4.9 million in cash. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 7.4 million. Net loss, adjusted for non-cash charges used 4.8 million in cash. The timing of other accrued expense, vendor and employee payments provided 4.0 million in cash. Decreases in prepaid software subscriptions used 1.2 million in cash. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 6.9 million, primarily the result of an investment in internal software development projects and purchases of property and equipment. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 1.9 million, which consisted of cash from short-term deposits of 10.0 million partially offset by 8.2 million of investment in internal software development projects and purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 19.7 million due to a payment on our revolving credit facility partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of options. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 0.8 million mainly due to proceeds from the exercise of options. 
 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure) 
 The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, to net cash provided by operating activities (in thousands): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 6,029 6,489 11,915 7,437 Loss on foreign exchange, net 
 (70) (321) Capital expenditures 
 (2,214) (2,410) (7,081) (8,190) Free Cash Flow 3,745 4,079 4,513 (753) 
 We generated Free Cash Flow of 3.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.1 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decline in cash from operations in the current period. 
 We generated 4.5 million in Free Cash Flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an outlay of Free Cash Flow of 0.8 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to improved cash from operations. 
 See Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for details regarding management s use of this non-GAAP measure. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements 
 Lease Commitments 
 Our lease commitments predominantly relate to rented office space. We rent facilities under operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through 2035, excluding any options for renewal. Minimum rental payments under operating leases at September 30, 2024 was 1.4 million in the next twelve months and 9.8 million thereafter, for a total of 11.2 million. Other lease arrangements were immaterial. On February 7, 2024, we amended our New York lease agreement, extending the term to 2035. The lease contains an option to extend the lease for an additional five-year period

 and early termination, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised. We expect to pay approximately 15.9 million in rent over the lease term. 
 Pledges and Bank Guarantees 
 In connection with the 2022 A R Agreement, we pledged 65,000 shares of common stock of our Israeli subsidiary, NIS 0.01 par value each. 
 We have a total of 0.6 million of pledged bank deposits as of September 30, 2024, in connection with office leases and credit cards. 
 
 Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with US GAAP, we believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), Adjusted EBITDA margin percent and Free Cash Flow are useful in evaluating our business. We use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin percent and Free Cash Flow as measures of operational efficiency to understand and evaluate our core business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our core business as well as comparisons to peers as similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other interested parties to evaluate businesses in our industry. Additionally, these figures provide an understanding and evaluation of our trends when comparing our operating results, on a consistent basis, by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not take the place of GAAP financial measures in evaluating our business. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Percent 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin percent are useful in evaluating our business. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and any long-lived asset impairment, any goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation expense, finance (income) expenses, retention bonus expenses, legal claims, severance costs, other and taxes on income. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin percent as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin percent permit a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. The following table presents a reconciliation from net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin percent, non-GAAP financial measures as used by management (in thousands): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) 
 4,665 (2,731) (12,111) (30,253) Net income (loss) margin percent

Table of Contents 

 (a) Finance income, net consists mostly of remeasurement related to revaluation of our warrants, remeasurement of our foreign subsidiary s monetary assets, liabilities and operating results, interest expense and interest income. 
 (b) Retention bonus expenses consists of retention bonuses for certain TVS employees. 

Other companies in our industry may calculate the above-described non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these measures are: 
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 they do not reflect costs of acquiring and integrating businesses, which will continue to be a part of our growth strategy; 
 they do not reflect severance costs; 
 they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay income taxes; 
 they do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges related mainly to intangible assets, certain assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using the non-GAAP financial measures supplementary. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and the impact of foreign exchange on cash. For further discussion of Free Cash Flow, including a reconciliation to cash flows provided by operating activities, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this document. 
 We believe Free Cash Flow is a helpful supplemental measure to assist us and investors in evaluating our liquidity. Further, we believe Free Cash Flow is useful to provide additional information to assess our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, including that it does not include capital expenditures and excludes the impact of foreign exchange on cash. 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate the above-described non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our US GAAP results and using the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. 
 Operational Metrics 
 In addition, Innovid s management considers the number of core clients, annual core clients retention and annual core clients net revenue retention in evaluating the performance of the business. We define core clients as advertisers or publishers that generated at least 100,000 of annual revenue. These metrics are reported annually. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 1. Financial Statements , we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Most of the Company s revenue is derived from digital ad solutions, where the Company provides a cloud-based ad serving platform for use by advertisers, media agencies and publishers. Standard, interactive and data driven digital video ads are delivered through this ad serving platform. Advertising impressions are served via the Company s cloud-based ad serving platform to various digital publishers across CTV, mobile TV, desktop TV, display and other channels. 
 InnovidXP, the Company s cloud-based cross-platform for TV ad measurement solution, measures the efficiency of CTV advertising and in-flight optimizations for TV marketers. The customers get insights into the effectiveness of their TV and digital advertising. 
 The Company also provides creative services for the design and development of interactive data-driven and dynamic ad formats by adding data, interactivity and dynamic features to standard ad units. 
 The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 and determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied. 
 For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct and are separately identifiable, the Company allocates the contract consideration to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price SSP ). SSP is typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis. 
 Revenue related to ad serving is recognized when impressions are delivered via the Company s ad serving platform. The Company recognizes revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. 
 Revenue related to the InnovidXP solution is recognized over time, since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company s performance. Revenue for this measurement subscription is recognized over the service period. 
 Revenue related to creative projects is recognized when the Company delivers an ad unit. Creative services projects are usually delivered within a week. 
 The Company s accounts receivable, consist primarily of receivables related to providing products and services described above, for which the Company s contracted performance obligations have been satisfied, the amount has been billed and the Company has an unconditional right to payment. The Company typically bills customers monthly based on actual delivery. The payment terms vary, mainly with terms of 60 days or less. 
 The typical contract term is twelve months or less for ASC 606 purposes. Most of the Company s contracts can be cancelled without cause. The Company has the unconditional right to payment for the services provided as of the date of the termination of the contracts. 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606 and does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. 
 Deferred revenue represents mostly unrecognized fees billed or collected for measurement platform services. Deferred revenue is recognized as (or when) we perform under the contract. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 We apply a fair value framework to measure and disclose its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
 Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
 Level 2 - Includes other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted deposits, trade receivables, net, trade payables, employees, payroll accruals, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Historical carrying amounts represent the approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
 We measure our investments in money market funds classified as cash equivalents and warrant liability at fair value. We determine the fair value of the warrants by using the closing price of our public warrants. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of the warrants liability is recognized in finance (income) expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets 
 Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever facts or circumstances either internally or externally may indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If there are indications of an impairment, we test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. If the asset or asset group is determined to be impaired, any excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. No impairment was recognized during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. In September 2023, the Company identified an impairment indicator for its legacy measurement product and recorded an impairment charge of 2.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Goodwill and intangible assets 
 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets have been recorded in the Company's financial statements resulting from various business combinations. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. As such, goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test. 
 The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the applicable business combination. Reporting units are evaluated when changes in the Company s operating structure occur, and, if necessary, goodwill is reassigned using a relative fair value allocation approach. The Company operates in one operating segment and this segment is the only reporting unit. 
 ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and other ASC 350 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually and, in certain circumstances, between annual tests. The accounting guidance gives the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The qualitative assessment considers events and 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed. 
 The Company elects to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company experienced a decline in its stock price resulting in its market capitalization being less than the carrying value of its one reporting unit. Thus, the Company performed quantitative assessments of the Company s reporting unit. The fair value was determined based on the market approach. The market approach utilizes the Company's market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium. Market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of common stock outstanding by the market price of its common stock. The control premium is determined by utilizing publicly available data from studies for similar transactions of public companies. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of 14.5 million. No impairment was recognized during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Separately acquired intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost including directly attributable costs. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
 Customer relationships and acquired technology are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of assets; approximately 11 years and 6 years, respectively. Amortization of customer relationships and acquired technology is presented within depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Capitalized software development costs 
 Software development costs, which are included in property and equipment, net, consists of capitalized costs related to the purchase and development of internal-use software. We use such software to provide services to our customers. The cost to purchase and develop internal-use software is capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed, and it is considered probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended. These costs include personnel and personnel-related employee benefits for employees directly associated with the software development and external costs of the materials or services consumed in developing or obtaining the software. 
 Any costs incurred for upgrades and functionality enhancements of the software are also capitalized. Once this software is ready for use in providing our services, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year estimated useful life. Amortization is presented within depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Cloud computing arrangements 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company capitalized certain application development phase costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements). Capitalized costs are included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, once the modules or components are ready for its intended use. This amortization will be recorded to software subscription expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Cash outflows from cloud computing arrangement implementation costs are classified within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Income taxes and tax contingencies 
 Income taxes are computed using a balance sheet approach reflecting both current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes reflect the tax impact of all the events included in the financial statements. The basic principles employed in the balance sheet approach are to reflect a current tax liability or asset that is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current and prior years, a deferred tax liability or asset that is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards, the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law of which the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated, and the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. There are certain situations in which deferred taxes are not provided. Some basis differences are not temporary differences because their reversals are not expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 The Company regularly evaluates deferred tax assets for future realization and establishes a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. The Company considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including existing cumulative losses in recent years, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates. 
 ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 (cumulative basis) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in taxes on income.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide this information. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during and as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Other than described below, we are not presently party to any legal proceedings or aware of any claims which we believe would have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated business prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows, or capital levels. We may from time-to-time be party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business.

 On March 4, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by the Nielsen Company (US) LLC against TV Squared, alleging infringement of US Patent No. 10.063.078. On June 1, 2022, TV Squared moved to transfer the case to the Southern District of New York, which was granted on January 18, 2023. On March 23, 2023, TV Squared moved for judgment on the pleadings that the asserted claims of the Nielsen patent are invalid because they are patent ineligible under 35 U.S.C. 101. The Court has not yet ruled on TV Squared s motion. While the motion has remained pending, discovery commenced. The Court also conducted a hearing to construe the patent claims on January 10, 2024, but has not issued a ruling. 
 On April 15, 2024 the Court issued an order to stay the case for ninety (90) days and to extend various deadlines as set out below, to allow the parties to continue settlement negotiations without incurring the substantial costs associated with the impending close of fact discovery and deadlines for expert reports. The parties agreed that the stay will apply to all interim deadlines, including the service of and responses and objections to written discovery. On July 2, 2024 the Court issued an order to extend the stay for an extra one hundred and twenty (120) days, and on October 23, 2024, the Court extended the stay for an additional eighty (80) days. 
 In the October 23, 2024 order, the Court set the date for the close of fact discovery as May 2, 2025 and the date for close of expert discovery as September 9, 2025. 
 No trial date has yet been set and the plaintiff has not specified the amount sought in the litigation. Given the uncertainty of litigation and the preliminary stage of the lawsuit, the Company is unable at this time to give an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss, if any, which might result to the Company if the outcome in such litigation was unfavorable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recorded a loss contingency.
