SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

(December 31, 2023 - ). The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing from its members or other sources,
as may be required. 

The
Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company s
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s sales and the status of competitive products.
The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities, revenue from operations and or affiliate
funding. 

While
the Company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term, there is no assurance that the Company s
activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or, if additional capital is needed,
that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern;
however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Impairment testing is required when events occur that indicate an asset group may not be recoverable triggering events ).
As detailed in ASC 360-10-35-21, the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances (sometimes referred to as impairment
indicators or triggers): (a) A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group) (b) A significant adverse
change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition. (c) A significant
adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset (asset group), including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator (d) An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected
for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset (asset group) (e) A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with
a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of
a long-lived asset (asset group) (f) A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold
or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to
a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent. We have evaluated our intangible assets and found that certain losses and a delay
in our business plan may have constituted a triggering event for our intangible assets.

When
such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset
or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess
of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets
and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company s management currently believes there is no impairment
of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company s
products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.

Taxes (Continued) 

ASC
740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax position, as defined,
seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspect of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for
income taxes. We adopted the provisions of ASC 740 as of January 1, 2007, and have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and
state jurisdictions where are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified
the U.S. federal and Massachusetts as our major tax jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, we remain subject to Internal
Revenue Service IRS examination of our income tax returns filed within the last three (3) years, and to Massachusetts
Department of Revenue examination of our income tax returns within the last four (4) years. However, certain tax attributes carry forwards
which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect
to the year in which such attributes are utilized. 

We
believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained in the audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that
will result in a material change to our financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain tax positions have been recorded pursuant
to ASC 740. Our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such items as a component

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Lease
Accounting 

For
contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2019, the Company assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains,
a lease. Generally, it determines that a lease exists when (i) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) obtains
the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset and (iii) it has the right to direct the use of the asset. 

At
the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases
with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The
lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,
which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any prepayments to the lessor and initial direct costs, such
as brokerage commissions, less any lease incentives received. 

All
right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease
liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of the Company s incremental
borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying lease. The incremental borrowing rates used for the initial
measurement of lease liabilities as of October 1, 2019, were based on the original lease terms. 

Lease
payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (i) fixed lease payments for the non-cancellable lease term, (ii)
fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (iii) variable
lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of the
Company s real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate, such
as sales and value-added taxes, the Company s proportionate share of actual property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance,
and utilities. The Company has adopted an accounting policy, as permitted by ASC 842, not to account for such payments as part of related
lease payments. Consequently, such payments are recognized as operating expenses when incurred. 

Lease
expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable
lease payments as incurred. Amortization of the right-of-use asset for operating leases reflects amortization of the lease liability,
any differences between straight-line expense and related lease payments during the accounting period, and any impairments. Finance lease
payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense, and the related asset is depreciated as described
under Equipment above.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required
to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. 

a)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent nor detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our
internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of our management and directors; and (iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Based
on such criteria, our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that it was effective as of December 31, 2023. 

As
a smaller reporting company, management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting is not subject to attestation
by our independent registered public accounting firm and as such, no attestation was performed by our independent registered public accounting
firm. 

b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred in our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
