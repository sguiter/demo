corporation on . On October 15, 2019, the Company
changed its name from LandStar, Inc. to Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. within the state of Nevada. 

The
Company delivers solutions and capabilities that businesses can use in conjunction with their use of established cloud vendors such as
Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as with on-premises databases and
database applications with virtualization platforms, such as those hosted or configured using VMWare , Citrix and Oracle 
clouds/products). 

consists of:
(i) a cash payment at closing; (ii) a promissory note issued by Data443 in favor of Centurion Centurion Note 
and (iii) in the form of a contingent payment. The Centurion Note matures January 19, 2027 but provides that Data443 s
repayment obligation would accelerate on the occurrence of certain events. One of those events was a financing event that did not occur
within the originally anticipated timeframe. If that event had occurred, then Data443 s repayment obligation would have been to
repay the balance of the outstanding principal and interest as follows: (i) of the then-outstanding amount due in cash; and
(ii) the remaining balance, at Data443 s option, in Common stock or a combination of Common stock and cash, with the number of
shares of Common stock to be determined according to a specified formula. In April 2022, Data443 and Centurion agreed that, even though
the trigger for this acceleration event did not occur, Data443 would issue shares of Common stock to Centurion in an amount then-equivalent
to , as partial repayment of the obligation due under the Centurion Note. The number of shares of Common stock Data443 issued
to Centurion on April 20, 2022, was . Because Data443 still has some repayment obligations to fulfill under the Centurion Note,
as of the filing date of these financial statements, the acquisition that is the subject of the Centurion Asset Purchase Agreement is
still not completed and is expected to be completed in 2024. 

All references to shares of our common stock in this annual report refers to the
number of shares of common stock after giving retrospective effect to these Reverse Stock Splits (unless otherwise indicated). 

and , respectively 

in stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 
in stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Determining the appropriate fair value model and the
related assumptions requires judgment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of each option grant was estimated
using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected volatility represents the historical volatility of our publicly traded common
stock. Due to limited historical data, we calculate the expected life based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual
term which is in accordance with the simplified method. The expected term for options granted to nonemployees is the contractual life.
The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options. We have
not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of Common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed
to be zero.

Slate
Advance Agreement 

In
March 2023 we entered into an agreement (the Slate Agreement with Slate Advance Slate pursuant to which
we sold in future receivables (the Slated Receivables Purchased Amount to Slate in exchange for payment to
the Company of in cash less fees of . The Company agreed to pay Slate at maximum of each day until the Slate
Receivables Purchased Amount is paid in full. The term of the Slate Agreement is indefinite. There is no stated interest rate. We recorded
the difference between the purchase price and the receivable purchase as a debt discount. The debt discount balance is amortized as payments
are made and recorded as interest expense. 

In
order to secure payment and performance of the Company s obligations to Slate under the Slate Agreement, the Company granted to
Slate a security interest in the following collateral: all accounts receivable and all proceeds as such term is defined by Article 9
of the UCC. We also agreed not to create, incur, assume, or permit to exist, directly or indirectly, any lien on or with respect to any
of such collateral. 

We
analyzed the transaction under the guidance of ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring to determine if the transaction qualified as a
troubled debt restructuring. For a debt restructuring to be considered troubled, the debtor must be experiencing financial difficulty,
and the creditor must have granted a concession. We analyzed the Slate Transaction under ASC 470-60 and determined that we met one of
the definitions of a company experiencing financial difficulty, such as currently in default of any of our debts. As we are not in default,
the fair value of the debt has not changed, we did not recognize gain or loss as the fair value has not changed, and the future undiscounted
cash flows are not greater or smaller than the carrying value, the creditor has not granted any concessions. We believe that the debt
does not fall into the troubled debt restructuring guidance since no concessions were granted by the creditor.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
for the year ended December 31, 2023 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, and the notes to those
financial statements that are included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the
 Quarterly Report ). 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, or projections
regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. All statements
other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms believes, estimates, 
 continues, anticipates, expects, seeks, projects, intends, 
 plans, may, will, would or should or, in each case, their negative
or other variations or comparable terminology. They appear in a number of places throughout this Quarterly Report, and include statements
regarding our intentions, beliefs, or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, future acquisitions, and the industry in which we operate. 

By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that
may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in
the Risk Factors section of the Annual Report, which include, but are not limited to, the following: 

we
 will need additional capital to fund our operations; 

there
 is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; 

we
 will face intense competition in our market, and we may lack sufficient financial and other resources to maintain and improve our
 competitive position; 

we
 are dependent on the continued services and performance of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jason Remillard; 

our
 common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink and is thinly traded, reducing your ability to liquidate your investment in us; 

we
 have had a history of losses and may incur future losses, which may prevent us from attaining profitability; 

the
 market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance; 

we
 have shares of preferred stock that have special rights that could limit our ability to undertake corporate transactions, inhibit
 potential changes of control, and reduce the proceeds available to our common stockholders in the event of a change in control; 

we
 have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends; 

our
 Chief Executive Officer has the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which limits our stockholders 
 ability to influence corporate affairs; and 

the
 other factors described in Risk Factors. 

Those
factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this quarterly report. 

19 

Although
we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and
industry developments may differ materially from statements made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this
quarterly report. The matters summarized under Overview , Risk Factors, Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Business and elsewhere in this quarterly report could
cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in our forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained
in this quarterly report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 

In
light of these risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking
statement that we make in this quarterly report speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update
any forward-looking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision to any of those statements to reflect future events
or developments, except as required by applicable law. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express
any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical
data. 

Overview 

We
provide data security and privacy management solutions across the enterprise and in the cloud. With over 10,000 customers, we provide
the visibility and control needed to protect data at scale, regardless of format, location, or consumer, and to facilitate compliance
with fast-changing global data privacy requirements. Our customers include established leaders and up-and-coming businesses spanning
the private and public/government sectors across diverse industries and fields, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing,
retail, technology, and telecommunications. 

The
mounting ransomware landscape and other threats to data have accelerated the rate at which businesses are adopting data security solutions
and we believe that our portfolio of data security and privacy products provides a comprehensive solution set that we believe positions
us to capitalize on that increased adoption rate and to establish our products as new data privacy and security standards. Our offerings
are anchored in reliable and comprehensive privacy management and equip organizations with a seamless approach to safeguard data, protect
against attacks, and otherwise mitigate the most critical risks. 

Sector-specific
US laws, state-level legislation, and outside-the-United States (OUS) regulations are confounding enterprises of all sizes for whom safeguarding
and stewarding data is key, but for whom becoming specialists in privacy and security is not an element of their strategic roadmap. For
many of these enterprises, we can bridge the gap between their need to protect data and their need to use their resources to grow their
core business by offering turnkey solutions and related counselling and technical support to offset risks from data breaches and security
incidents of various types. We provide products and services for the marketplace that are designed to protect data that is stored in
the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid cloud/on-premises environments, and data that is transmitted throughout the enterprise, including
but not limited to by remote employees. Our suite of security products focuses on protecting sensitive files and email, confidential
customer, patient and employee data, financial records, strategic and product plans, intellectual property and other proprietary information,
allowing our customers to create, share, and protect their sensitive data wherever it is stored and however it is used. 

We
deliver solutions and capabilities that businesses can use in conjunction with their use of established cloud vendors such as Microsoft 
Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as with on-premises databases and database applications
and with virtualization platforms, such as those hosted or configured using VMWare , Citrix , and Oracle products. 

We
sell or plan to sell substantially all of our products and services through a sales model that combines the leverage of a channel sales
model or direct account management, thereby providing us with opportunities to grow our current customer base and deliver our value proposition
for data privacy and security. We endeavour to use subscription models to license products and services, commonly for a paid in-advance,
multiyear term that is auto-renewing. We also make use of channel partners, distributors, and resellers which sell to end-users of the
products and services. This approach allows us to maintain close relationships with our customers and benefit from the global reach of
our partners. Additionally, we are enhancing our product offerings and go-to-market strategy by establishing technology alliances within
the IT infrastructure and security vendor ecosystem. Our sales and marketing focus for new organic growth is on organizations with 500
or more users who are adopting cloud services and can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value. 

We
continue to onboard to cloud-native technology adoption portals such as the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and the Amazon AWS
Marketplace. Vendors may offer incentives to us as a software and services provider to onboard and market via their marketplace portals. 

20 

We
strive to create new and innovative products and to improve existing products, proactively identifying and solving the data security
needs of our customers. 

As
cloud adoption continues to accelerate, data privacy requirements get more complex, and data security becomes more challenging, we believe
we are well positioned to capture more market share, continue to lead in strategic data security technology development, and prepare
organizations for the next epoch in IT data privacy services. 

Our
Products 

Each

products are modular, giving our customers the flexibility to select what they require for their business needs and to expand their usage

 at a premium. 

Outlook 

Our
objective is to further integrate our suite of data security, ransomware protection, and privacy products and offer the products alone
or in combination to enterprise customers directly and via our partner channels. We aim to position our products to meet the challenges
our customers face - data privacy concerns grow in lockstep with security breaches, the need to continually expand data storage, and
to meet telework, telehealth, and remote learning requirements. 

We
have relied on and expect to continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions of products, talent, and an established customer base to
contribute to our long-term growth objectives. 

Key
elements of our growth strategy may be summarized as follows: 

Acquisitions .
We intend to aggressively pursue acquisitions of other cybersecurity software and service providers focused on the data security sector.
We target companies with a developed and/or steady client base, as well as companies with offerings that complement our existing suite
of products. 

Research
 Development; Innovation . We intend to increase our spending on research and development to create new and innovative products
and to improve existing products, proactively identifying and solving the data security needs of our clients. 

Grow
Our Customer Base . We believe the continued challenges businesses face in managing their enterprise data and the ever-evolving landscape
of cybersecurity threats will keep the demand high for the type of products and services we offer. We intend to capitalize on this demand
by continually developing and curating a collection of products and services that are attractive and relevant to both our established
revenue base and to new customers. 

Expand
Our Sales Capacity . We believe that continuing to expand our sales force will be essential to achieving our expansion and growth.
We intend to expand our sales capacity by adding sales and marketing employees, with heavy focus on customer success and leveraging our
existing customer relationships. 

22 

Management s
Plans 

Our
plan is to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions, and then expand selling across our subsidiaries and affiliated
companies. During the next twelve months, we anticipate incurring costs related to (i) filing of Exchange Act reports; and (ii) operating
our businesses. We will require additional operating capital to maintain and continue operations. We will need to raise additional capital
through debt or equity financing, and there is no assurance we will be able to raise the necessary capital. 

While
we primarily report income based on recognized and deferred revenue, another measurement internally for the business is booked revenues.
Management uses this measure to track numerous indicators such as: contract value growth; initial contract value per customer; and certain
other values that change quarter-over-quarter. These results may also be subject to, and impacted by, sales compensation plans, internal
performance objectives, and other activities. We continue to increase revenue from our existing operations. We generally recognize revenue
from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription, which is generally one year at a time. As a result, a substantial portion
of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we executed
during previous periods. Consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected
in our revenue for that period. Any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns
or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future
periods. 

Recent
Developments 

Acquisition
of Certain Assets of Cyren Ltd. 

On
May 15, 2023 we entered into an agreement to purchase certain assets (the Cyren Assets of Cyren Ltd. Cyren a company that provided emerging and high-volume risk mitigation services for some of the world s largest name brand organizations
prior to its bankruptcy filing in February 2023. Pursuant to a purchase agreement, the appointed receiver for the Cyren Assets (the Receiver agreed to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to us, and we agreed to purchase from the Receiver, all right, title, and interest
in and to the Cyren Assets, as further described in the purchase agreement, as amended on December 12, 2023 (as so amended, the Purchase
Agreement ). On December 15, 2023 we closed the transaction. 

Under
the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we acquired goodwill, clients, proprietary technology and intellectual property related to three
services: threat intelligence, URL categorization and email security. We believe the transaction enhances our existing product portfolio
and accelerates the development of next-generation solutions. Cyren s technology is based on a combination of artificial intelligence,
machine learning and big-data analytics, which we believe enables Cyren to identify and mitigate threats in real time, sooner than many
competitors. 

Cyren s
clients include some of the world s largest name brand organizations and provides fast-breaking threat detection services and threat
intelligence to major firewall vendors, email providers, leading cybersecurity vendors, and other industries such as gaming and e-commerce. 

We
believe that the Cyren technology, services and customers strengthen our competitive position by broadening our product offerings and
enhancing our technological capabilities.

Revenue 

The
increase in revenue is due to our customers of Cyren related offerings after one year post our acquisition of intellectual property from
the Appointed Receiver for the Assets of Cyren Ltd. Many customers that we reacquired after the purchase were still in contract negotiations
as of the end of Q3 2023. We continue to see organic growth in increased consumption of our services that contain storage
or volume components, matching our expectations and as is reflected in our continuing Annual Recurring Revenue ARR growth.
We are offering and closing deals based on professional services consulting to further enable our technological capabilities within our
existing customer base and new customer opportunities. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue consists of direct expenses, such as labor, shipping, and supplies. The increase in cost of revenue is a result of costs associated
with our acquisition of Cyren intellectual property, specifically our large data center spent. Significant efforts continue to reduce/minimize
the operating footprint of the Cyren Assets as well increased emphasis on productivity for the Company in general.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

The
general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of management costs, costs to integrate assets we acquired and to expand sales,
product enhancements, audit and review fees, filing fees, professional fees, and other expenses related to SEC reporting, in connection
with the projected growth of our business. Additionally, we continue to incur specific one-time costs in relation to our planned national
exchange-based uplisting, additional financing activities and related functions. The increase in general and administrative expense was
primarily due to a slight increase in payroll expense and professional service fees but we continue a general cost reduction effort by
the Company. As a specific effort of our expense and cost reduction efforts, we are not renewing our corporate office space at
the end of our current lease and moving to an all-remote working environment. This specific change will result in an annual savings of
over 385,000. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

The
sales and marketing expenses primarily consisted of additional focus on cross-sell, upsell and growth in existing contracts from customers.
As our retention activities of the assets of Cyren customer base has largely transitioned to increased consumption and quality of service
delivery efforts. The decrease in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to the timing related to our focused investments in marketing
campaigns, supporting tools and direct client engagement efforts to form our product roadmaps and continue to deliver significant value
to our clients. 

Other
income (expense) 

Other
income (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of interest expense. Other expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of interest expense as well as the affect of the settlement of debt. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss decreased 35 from net loss of 1,979,676 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to net loss of 1,281,999 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024. The net loss was mainly derived from an operating loss of 814,646, and interest expense of 466,200.
The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was mainly derived from an operating loss of 1,002,044, and interest expense
of 983,100. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the decrease in interest and increase in revenue and gross profit from the
prior year s three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 

Revenues
increased 41 from 2,692,681 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3,807,080 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
The increase in revenue is due to our acquisition of intellectual property from the Appointed Receiver for the Assets of Cyren Ltd. However,
we continue to see organic growth in increased consumption of our services that contain storage or volume components, matching our expectations
and as is reflected in our continuing Annual Recurring Revenue ARR growth. We are offering and closing deals based on
professional services consulting to further enable our technological capabilities within our existing customer base. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue consists of direct expenses, such as labor, software and technology, and supplies. The increase in cost of revenue is a result
of costs associated with our acquisition of Cyren intellectual property, specifically our large data center spent. Significant efforts
continue to reduce/minimize the operating footprint of the Cyren Assets as well increased emphasis on productivity for the Company in
general. 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 our operating expenses were as follows:

General
and Administrative Expenses 

The
general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of management costs, costs to integrate assets we acquired and to expand sales,
product enhancements, audit and review fees, filing fees, professional fees, and other expenses related to SEC reporting, including the
re-classification of sales-related management expenses, in connection with the projected growth of our business. Additionally, we continue
to incur specific costs in relation to our planned uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Markets, additional financing activities and related
functions. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the Company s emphasis on reducing overall costs,
decreasing overhead expenses, and finding savings specific to our acquisition-related costs. As a specific effort of our expense and cost reduction efforts, we are not renewing our corporate office space at
the end of our current lease and moving to an all-remote working environment. This specific change will result in an annual savings of
over 385,000. 

Sales

The
sales and marketing expenses primarily consisted of additional focus on cross-sell, upsell and growth in existing contracts from customers.
As our retention activities of the assets of Cyren customer base has largely transitioned to increased consumption and quality of service

nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of interest expense and an forgiveness of debt on note payable of 4,724,299. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss increased 60 from 2,628,029 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4,421,955 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024. The net loss was mainly derived from an operating loss of 2,128,745, and interest expense of 2,287,538. The net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 was mainly derived from an operating loss of 2,589,922 and interest expense of 4,947,656 and settlement
of debt of 4,909,549. 

Accumulated
Losses 

We
had a net operating loss carryfowards of approximately 6 million from prior operations in 2017, before our current President and Chief
Executive Officer acquired a controlling interest in the company. Subsequent to this and through September 30, 2024, we have relied on
convertible notes and other debt instruments that may contain unfavorable discounts, origination fees, and have embedded conversion features
that are subject to derivative treatment for accounting purposes. Due primarily to this treatment of convertible notes, debt and related
derivative accounting, since 2017, we have accumulated deficits of approximately 14.1 million due to derivative valuations and 16.3
million expensed for interest and amortization of debt discounts for financing and other origination fees.

We
require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for capital expenditures. As of September
30, 2024, we had bank overdraft of 1,038 and our principal sources of liquidity were trade accounts receivable of 58,134, and prepaid
expenses and other current assets of 0, as compared to cash of 84,570, trade accounts receivable of 309,768 and prepaid and other
current assets of 29,467 as of December 31, 2023. 

During
the last two years, and through the date of this Report, we have faced an increasingly challenging liquidity situation that has limited
our ability to execute our operating plan. We will need to obtain capital to continue operations. There is no assurance that we will
be able to secure such funding on acceptable terms. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a loss from operations
of 4,421,955. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had assets of cash in the amount of 0 and other current assets in the amount of 58,134. As of September 30,
2024, we had current liabilities of 16,032,862. Our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was 60,078,791. 

As
of December 31, 2023, we had assets of cash in the amount of 84,570 and other current assets in the amount of 339,235. As of December
31, 2023, we had current liabilities of 13,801,416. We accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023 was 55,656,836. 

The
revenues generated from our current operations will not be sufficient to fund our planned growth. We will require additional capital
to continue to operate our business, and to further expand our business. Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions
or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful
in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other
means. Unless we can attract additional investment, our operating as a going concern is in doubt. 

We
are now obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ). In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules
subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB have imposed various requirements
on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase
our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities of ours more time-consuming and costly. In order to meet the needs
to comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act, we will need investment of capital. 

Management
has determined that additional capital will be required in the form of equity or debt securities. There is no assurance that management
will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

If
we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may have to cease filing the required reports and cease operations
completely. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future
obligations, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or the equity
securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the common stock.

For September 30, 2024 we had net cash outflows for financing activities of 867,226. By comparison, during the nine months ended September
30, 2023, we raised 1,067,631 from issuance of convertible debt, received proceeds from a related party of 318,447, and repaid of convertible
note payable of 294,868, repaid of 1,252,955 on notes payable; and repaid to a related party of 60,000. For September 30, 2023 we
had net cash outflows for financing activities of 232,086. 

We
are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan.
If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods
presented. 

Our
critical estimates include revenue recognition and intangible assets. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual
results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied. We also have
other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, however, the application of these
policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. 

The
critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows: 

Convertible
Financial Instruments 

We
bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free standing derivative financial instruments if certain
criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument
are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies
both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted
accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms
as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument
is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable GAAP. 

When
we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded
for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying
Common Stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument. 

27 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees
and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date. For non-employees, as per ASU No. 2018-7, Compensation-Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Stock-Based Payment Accounting, remeasurement is not required. The fair value
amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting
period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by us in the same expense classifications in the consolidated statements of operations,
as if such amounts were paid in cash. Also, refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial
statements that are included in this Annual Report.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. However, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period reported on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that we have material weaknesses and significant
deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not sufficient to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
chief executive officer and our chief financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. An evaluation was performed of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation was based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

28 

Based
on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that,
as of September 30, 2024 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of the identification of material weaknesses
described as follows: 

We
 did not have controls designed to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of accounting
 transactions. Accordingly, we believe we have a material weakness because there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
 to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us. Management evaluated
 the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure
 controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
 nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
 possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
 individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
 and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

We
 do not have a functioning audit committee or outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the
 establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 

Remediation
Plan for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is committed to improving its internal controls when we have adequate resources to do so, we appointed a full-time Chief Financial
Officer in September but do not currently have independent directors or an audit committee. Until there are independent directors and
an audit committee, we will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties by (i) continuing to use third party specialists to assist us
with accounting and finance; and (ii) commissioning frequent reconciliations of significant accounts using independent auditors. 

Our
Management has discussed the material weaknesses noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature
of these material weaknesses, it is reasonably possible that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected during our financial close and reporting process. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the
normal course of our business. The ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any claims of any type (either alone or in the aggregate)
may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the ultimate outcome of
any litigation is uncertain. Any outcome (including any for the actions described above), whether favorable or unfavorable, may materially
and adversely affect us due to legal costs and expenses, diversion of management attention and other factors. We expense legal costs
in the period incurred. We cannot assure you that additional contingencies of a legal nature or contingencies having legal aspects will
not be asserted against us in the future, and these matters could relate to prior, current or future transactions or events. 

On
August 9, 2024, Plaintiff Guy Gissin, Adv., in his capacity as the Appointed Receiver for the Assets of Cyren Ltd. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary (the
 Subsidiary ), in US District Court Eastern District of North Carolina, naming the Subsidiary as the defendant (the Complaint ).
The Subsidiary is in the process of engaging local litigation counsel to defend itself in the litigation. An answer to the Complaint
will be filed shortly. Based on the early stages of the Complaint, and the inherent uncertainty as to the outcome, at this time, the
Company is not able to reasonably estimate a possible range of loss. 

The
Company views most legal proceedings involving claims of former employees as routine litigation incidental to the business, and therefore
not material. 

We
are not aware of any other pending or threatened litigation against us that in our view would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, liquidity, or operating results. However, legal claims are inherently uncertain, and we cannot assure you that we
will not be adversely affected in the future by legal proceedings.
