Discussion of Segment Profitability Measures 

As of September 30, 2024, we were engaged in the
following businesses: the production and sale of fertilizers through Jinong and Gufeng, the production and sale of high-quality agricultural
products by Yuxing and the production and sale of Bitcoin by Antaeus. For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized into
four main business segments based on locations and products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), Yuxing (agricultural
products production) and Antaeus (Bitcoin). Each of the segments has its own annual budget about development, production and sales. 

Each of the four operating segments referenced
above has separate and distinct general ledgers. The chief operating decision maker CODM makes decisions with respect
to resources allocation and performance assessment upon receiving financial information, including revenue, gross margin, operating income
and net income produced from the various general ledger systems; however, net income by segment is the principal benchmark to measure
profit or loss adopted by the CODM. 

For Jinong, the net loss decreased by 94,720,
or 82.8 , to (19,642) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from (114,362) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease in net loss was principally due to lower general and administrative expenses. 

For Gufeng, the net loss increased by 73,276,
or 5.8 , to (1,335,699) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from (1,262,423) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase in net loss was principally due to the decrease in net sales. 

For Yuxing, the net income increased 68,552 or
44.4 , to 222,823 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 154,271 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
was mainly due to lower general and administrative expenses. 

For Antaeus, the net loss increased by 129,654,
or 780.9 , to (146,257) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from (16,603) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal sources of liquidity include cash
from operations, borrowings from local commercial banks and net proceeds of offerings of our securities. 

As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents
were 51,477,572, a decrease of 7,295,015, or 12.4 , from 58,772,587 as of June 30, 2024. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from our securities
offerings, as well as other working capital if required, to acquire new businesses, upgrade production lines and complete Yuxing s
new greenhouse facilities for agriculture products located on 88 acres of land in Hu County, 18 kilometers southeast of Xi an city.
We believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow from operations to support our business growth for the
next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions or expansions. However, if events or circumstances occur
and we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required to seek additional capital and/or to reduce certain discretionary
spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous, which
may include additional debt and/or equity financings. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable
terms, if at all. Any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive
covenants.

financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the proceeds from loans with amount
of 5,726,880 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, our loans payable was

Accounts Receivable 

We had accounts receivable of 22,322,256 as of
September 30, 2024, as compared to 16,493,068 as of June 30, 2024, an increase of 5,829,188, or 35.3 . 

Allowance for doubtful accounts in accounts receivable
as of September 30, 2024 was 24,199,086, an increase of 1,457,390, or 6.4 , from 22,741,696 as of June 30, 2024. And the allowance
for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable was 52.0 as of September 30, 2024 and 58.0 as of June 30, 2024. 

Deferred assets 

We had no deferred assets as of September 30,
2024 and June 30, 2024. During the three months, we assisted the distributors in certain marketing efforts and developing standard stores
to expand our competitive advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain
marketing efforts and store development will be expensed over three years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a
distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the
amount owed by the distributor is payable to us immediately. The deferred assets had been fully amortized as of September 30, 2024. 

25 

Inventories 

We had inventories of 35,368,718 as of September
30, 2024, as compared to 37,826,456 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of 2,457,738, or 6.5 . The decrease was primarily due to Gufeng s
inventory. As of September 30, 2024, Gufeng s inventory was 7,699,836, compared to 11,225,115 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease
of 3,525,279, or 31.4 . The Company confirmed the loss of 2.0 million and 2.4 million of inventories for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Advances to Suppliers 

We had advances to suppliers of 15,942,668 as
of September 30, 2024 as compared to 12,110,034 as of June 30, 2024, representing an increase of 3,832,634, or 31.6 . Our inventory
level may fluctuate from time to time, depending how quickly the raw material is consumed and replenished during the production process,
and how soon the finished goods are sold. The replenishment of raw material relies on management s estimate of numerous factors,
including but not limited to, the raw materials future price, and spot price along with its volatility, as well as the seasonal demand
and future price of finished fertilizer products. Such estimate may not be accurate, and the purchase decision of raw materials based
on the estimate can cause excessive inventories in times of slow sales and insufficient inventories in peak times. 

Accounts Payable 

We had accounts payable of 1,625,523 as of September
30, 2024 as compared to 1,685,725 as of June 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 60,201, or 3.6 . 

Customer Deposits (Unearned Revenue) 

We had customer deposits of 7,320,054 as of September
30, 2024 as compared to 4,937,207 as of June 30, 2024, representing an increase of 2,382,847, or 48.3 . The increase was mainly attributable
to Gufeng 7,057,732 unearned revenue as of September 30, 2024, compared to 4,391,668 unearned revenue as of June 30, 2024, increased
 2,666,064, or 60.7 , caused by the advance deposits made by clients. This increase was due to seasonal fluctuation and we expect to deliver
products to our customers during the next three months at which time we will recognize the revenue. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s discussion and analysis of
its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting
policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Basis
of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following paragraphs reflect the most critical
accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations: 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these
estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results and outcomes may differ from
management s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. 

26 

Revenue recognition 

Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment
to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, we have no other significant
obligations and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied
are recorded as unearned revenue. 

Our revenue consists of invoiced value of goods,
net of a value-added tax (VAT). No product return or sales discount allowance is made as products delivered and accepted by customers
are normally not returnable and sales discounts are normally not granted after products are delivered. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

For statement of cash flows purposes, we consider
all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Accounts receivable 

Our policy is to maintain reserves for potential
credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy
of these reserves. Any accounts receivable of Jinong and Gufeng that are outstanding for more than 180 days will be accounted as allowance
for bad debts, and any accounts receivable of Yuxing that are outstanding for more than 90 days will be accounted as allowance for bad
debts. 

Deferred assets 

Deferred assets represent amounts the Company
advanced to the distributors in their marketing and stores development to expand our competitive advantage and market shares. Based
on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts and store development will be expensed
over three years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement
with us earlier than the realization of the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the amount owed by the distributor is to be
refunded to us immediately. The deferred assets had been fully amortized as of September 30, 2024. 

Segment reporting 

FASB ASC 280 requires use of the management
approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s management organizes
segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services,
geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other way management disaggregates a company. 

As of September 30, 2024, we were organized
into four main business units: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), Yuxing (agricultural products
production) and Antaeus (Bitcoin). For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized into four main business segments
based on locations and products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), Yuxing (agricultural products
production) and Antaeus(Bitcoin). Each of the segments has its own annual budget regarding development, production, and sales.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Disclosures About Market Risk 

We may be exposed to changes in financial market
conditions in the normal course of business. Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur because of movements in interest
rates and equity prices. We currently do not, in the normal course of business, use financial instruments that are subject to changes
in financial market conditions. 

Currency Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk 

Substantially all our revenues and expenses are
denominated in RMB. However, we use the U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes. Conversion of RMB into foreign currencies is regulated
by the People s Bank of China through a unified floating exchange rate system. Although the PRC government has stated its intention
to support the value of RMB, there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that RMB will not devalue
significantly against U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value, in U.S. dollar terms, of our net assets
and income derived from our operations in the PRC. 

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Except
for U.S. holding companies, all our consolidated revenues, consolidated costs and expenses, and our assets are denominated in RMB. As
a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange
rate between the U.S. dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets
as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the
balance sheet dates, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates, and shareholders equity is translated
at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income (loss) but are included
in determining other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated other
comprehensive loss was 22 million. We have not entered any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. The
value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC s political and
economic conditions. Between July 1, 2024 and September 30, 2024, China s currency increased by a cumulative 3.6 against the U.S.
dollar, making Chinese exports more expensive and imports into China cheaper by that percentage. The effect on trade can be substantial.
Moreover, it is possible that in the future, the PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen
intervention in the foreign exchange market. 

Interest Rate Risk 

We deposit surplus funds with Chinese banks earning
daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. All our outstanding debt instruments carry fixed rates of interest.
The amount of short-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was 5.5 million and 7.5 million, respectively.
We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short-term bank loans. Although the interest rates, which are based
on the banks prime rates with respect to our short-term loans, are fixed for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically three
to twelve months for short-term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal. There was no material change in interest
rates for short-term bank loans renewed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The original loan term on average is one year,
and the remaining average life of the short term-loans is approximately nine months. 

Management monitors the banks prime rates
in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have
not entered any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. 

Credit Risk 

We have experienced higher credit risk than usual
since 2020. With the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the overdue outstanding accounts receivable increased significantly compared with the
years prior to the pandemic. Our accounts receivables are typically unsecured and are mainly derived from revenues earned from customers
in the PRC. Most of our customers are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs ), which may not have strong
cash flows or be well capitalized. They may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. Many of the SMEs
that we work with cannot weather COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or they cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged
outbreak. Numerous distributors encountered significant difficulties and/or hardships in their businesses amid the pandemic. Even through
our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers, the bad debts expenses are higher in recent 3 years comparing with the
years before 2020. 

28 

Inflation Risk 

Inflationary factors such as increases in the
cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Notwithstanding the measures taken by the PRC government
to control inflation, China still experienced an increase in inflation and our operating cost became higher than anticipated. The
high rate of inflation had an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 

Risk of epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks 

The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected,
and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations. This is or may be due to closures
or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for
our products and services, and credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us. We share
most of these risks with all businesses. 

In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly
increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 may cause a global recession, which would
have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations, and this impact could exist for an extensive period. 

The Company is continuing to monitor the situation
and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors
outside the Company s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development
and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic
on the global economy and demand for consumer products. 

Additional future impacts on the Company may include,
but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company s products and services; the Company s supply chain
and sales and distribution channels; the Company s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company s profitability
and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company s business, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described above. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), at the conclusion of the period ended September 30, 2024 we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective and adequately designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and that
such information was accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allowed
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in internal controls 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15
that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
