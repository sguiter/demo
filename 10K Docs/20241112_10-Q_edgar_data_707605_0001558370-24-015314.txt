 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS locations in Pennsylvania and location in Maryland. The Trust Company offers a complete range of trust and financial services and administers assets valued at billion and billion that are not reported on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Effective October 1, 2024, the Trust Company merged with and into the Bank. See Note 17 Subsequent Events for more information. In addition, the Parent Company is an administrative group that provides support in such areas as audit, finance, investments, loan review, general services, and marketing. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and the differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company s most significant estimates relate to the allowance for credit losses (related to investment securities, loans, and unfunded commitments), pension, and derivatives (interest rate swaps/hedges). of the total gross revenue of the Company. Non-interest income within the scope of Topic 606 is as follows: Wealth management fees - Wealth management fee income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and customer investment portfolios. The Company s performance obligation is generally satisfied over a period of time and the resulting fees are billed monthly or quarterly, based upon the month end market value of the assets under management. Payment is generally received after month end through a direct charge to customers accounts. Due to this delay in payment, a receivable of has been established as of September 30, 2024 and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in order to properly recognize the revenue earned but not yet received. Other performance obligations (such as delivery of account statements to customers) are generally considered immaterial to the overall transactions price. Commissions on transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis as the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time in which the trade is processed. Also included within wealth management fees are commissions from the sale of mutual funds, annuities, and life insurance products.

The Company had non-cash transfers to other real estate owned (OREO) and repossessed assets of in the first nine months of 2024 compared to non-cash transfers in the same 2023 period. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company entered into a new operating lease related to an office location and recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability of million. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company entered into two new financing leases related to an office location and equipment and recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of . The execution of these new leases was partially offset by the termination of financing leases related to an office location and equipment which led to the write-off of of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities during the first nine months of 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company entered into a new financing lease related to an office location and recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability of . As a result of the adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (CECL), the Company had non-cash transactions during the first nine months of 2023 associated with the day one adjustments necessary to record the adoption. Specifically, the adoption of this accounting standard necessitated that a day one increase of million be made to the allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio. Furthermore, ASC 326 necessitated that the Company establish an allowance for expected credit losses for held to maturity (HTM) debt securities. Based upon the credit quality of the Company s HTM debt securities portfolio, the day one allowance for credit losses on our HTM securities portfolio totaled . Finally, the adoption of CECL led to the recognition of a day one increase of for the Company s unfunded loan commitments.

 credit losses. As such, allowance for credit losses has been established for these securities. The allowance for credit losses on the taxable municipal, corporate, and other bonds within the held to maturity securities portfolio is calculated using the probability of default/loss given default (PD/LGD) method. The calculation is completed on a quarterly basis using the default studies provided by an industry leading source. Additionally, based on management judgment, certain qualitative adjustments, such as the Company s historical loss experience and/or the issuer s credit quality, may be applied. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on the held to maturity securities portfolio totaled and , respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held to maturity debt securities is included within investment securities held to maturity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded within provision (recovery) for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accrued interest receivable on held to maturity debt securities totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included within accrued interest income receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. Held to maturity debt securities are typically classified as non-accrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest. When held to maturity debt securities are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. The Company had held to maturity debt securities in non-accrual status or past due over 90 days still accruing interest at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The underlying issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Allowance for Credit Losses Available for Sale Securities The Company measures expected credit losses on available for sale debt securities when the Company does not intend to sell, or when it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available for sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, equal to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on the available for sale securities portfolio totaled and , respectively. The allowance for credit losses on available for sale debt securities is included within investment securities available for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded within provision (recovery) for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Losses are charged against the allowance when the Company believes the collectability of an available for sale security is in jeopardy or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled million and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included within accrued interest income receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. Available for sale debt securities are typically classified as non-accrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest.

This is compared to available for sale debt security in non-accrual status at December 31, 2023 totaling with an associated allowance for credit losses of . When these corporate securities were transferred to non-accrual status, interest income from investments was unfavorably impacted due to the reversal of previously recognized income. Specifically, unpaid interest on these securities which was reversed totaled for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

 ) U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities ) Municipal ) ) Corporate bonds and other securities ) ) Total ) ) The Company sold AFS securities during the third quarter of 2024 while the proceeds from the sale of AFS securities totaled during the first nine months of 2024 resulting in the recognition of gross investment security gains or losses. The Company had established an allowance for credit losses on one of the AFS securities sold during the first nine months of 2024. In accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses , once the Company decided to sell the security (i.e. intent to sell), the security was charged down, against the allowance, to fair value therefore resulting in gain or loss. The Company sold AFS securities during the third quarter or first nine months of 2023. The carrying value of securities, both available for sale and held to maturity, pledged to secure public and trust deposits was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The interest rate environment and market yields can have a significant impact on the yield earned on mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Prepayment speed assumptions are an important factor to consider when evaluating the returns on an MBS. Generally, as interest rates decline, borrowers have more incentive to refinance into a lower rate, so prepayments will rise. Conversely, as interest rates increase, prepayments will decline. When an MBS is purchased at a premium, the yield will decrease as prepayments increase and the yield will increase as prepayments decrease. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had low premium risk as the book value of our mortgage-backed securities purchased at a premium was only of the par value. Contractual maturities of securities at September 30, 2024 are shown below (in thousands). Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. The weighted average duration of the total investment securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 was months and was shorter than the duration at December 31, 2023 which was months. The duration remains within our internally established guideline to not exceed which we believe was appropriate to maintain proper levels of liquidity, interest rate risk, market valuation sensitivity and profitability.

Additionally, at September 30, 2024, within the available for sale debt securities portfolio, the Company had U.S. Agency, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal, and corporate bonds that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months with depreciation of from its amortized cost basis. These unrealized losses are primarily a result of increases in market yields from the time of purchase. In general, as market yields rise, the value of securities will decrease; as market yields decrease, the fair value of securities will increase. Management generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary; therefore, provision for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. Management has also concluded that based on current information we expect to continue to receive scheduled interest payments as well as the entire principal balance. Furthermore, management does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before they recover in value or mature. Total

The provision recovery in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects minimal loan growth as well as improved historical loss rates since June 30, 2024. For the nine months of 2024, the Company recognized a provision for credit losses recovery for loans after recognizing of provision expense in the first nine months of 2023, representing a favorable shift between years. The provision for credit losses recovery for the nine-month timeframe of 2024 was the result of a favorable adjustment to the historical loss and qualitative factors used to calculate the allowance for credit losses in accordance with CECL. The allowance for loan credit losses at September 30, 2024 is million, or , higher than the allowance for loan credit losses at September 30, 2023. The increase since last year s third quarter end was due to the Company strengthening its allowance for loan credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-performing assets from the loan portfolio, which are discussed in detail below, decreased from million at December 31, 2023 to million at September 30, 2024 primarily due to a reduction in non-accrual commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans. Non-performing assets from the loan portfolio were at of total loans as of September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company experienced net loan charge-offs of , or of total average loans, compared to net charge-offs of , or of total average loans, in the first nine months of 2023. In summary, the allowance for credit losses on the loan portfolio provided coverage of non-performing loans, and of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to coverage of non-performing loans, and of total loans, at December 31, 2023. Historical credit loss experience is the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. The Company applies historical loss rates to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. After consideration of the historic loss calculation, management applies qualitative adjustments to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already captured in the historical loss information at the balance sheet date. Our reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment is based on a blend of peer and Company data as well as management judgment. Including peer data addresses the Company s lack of loss history in some pools of loans. For periods beyond our reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years, loss expectations revert to the long-run historical mean. The qualitative adjustments for current conditions are based upon the following factors: changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in economic conditions; changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio; staff experience; changes in volume and severity of delinquency, non-performing loans, and classified loans; changes in the quality of the Company s loan review system; trends in underlying collateral value; concentration risk; and

 of the third quarter of 2024 general reserve represented qualitative adjustment with representing quantitative reserve. In accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , the Company will evaluate individual loans for expected credit losses when those loans do not share similar risk characteristics with loans evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. In contrast to legacy accounting standards, this criterion is broader than the impairment concept and management may evaluate loans individually even when no specific expectation of collectability is in place. Loans will not be included in both collective and individual analysis. The individual analysis will establish a specific reserve for loans in scope. It should be noted that there is a review threshold of or more for loans being subject to individual evaluation within the consumer and residential mortgage segments. Specific reserves are established based on the following three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate; 2) the loan s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral dependent. The method is selected on a loan-by-loan basis, with management primarily utilizing either the discounted cash flows or the fair value of collateral method. The evaluation of the need and amount of a specific allocation of the allowance is made on a quarterly basis. The need for an updated appraisal on collateral dependent loans is determined on a case-by-case basis. The useful life of an appraisal or evaluation will vary depending upon the circumstances of the property and the economic conditions in the marketplace. A new appraisal is not required if there is an existing appraisal which, along with other information, is sufficient to determine a reasonable value for the property and to support an appropriate and adequate allowance for credit losses. At a minimum, annual documented reevaluation of the property is completed by the Bank s internal Collections and Assigned Risk Department to support the value of the property. When reviewing an appraisal associated with an existing real estate collateral dependent transaction, the Bank s Chief Credit Officer must determine if there have been material changes to the underlying assumptions in the appraisal which affect the original estimate of value. Some of the factors that could cause material changes to reported values include: the passage of time; the volatility of the local market; the availability of financing; natural disasters; the inventory of competing properties; new improvements to, or lack of maintenance of, the subject property or competing properties upon physical inspection by the Bank; changes in underlying economic and market assumptions, such as material changes in current and projected vacancy, absorption rates, capitalization rates, lease terms, rental rates, sales prices, concessions, construction overruns and delays, zoning changes, etc.; and/or environmental contamination. 
 The value of the property is adjusted to appropriately reflect the above listed factors and the value is discounted to reflect the value impact of a forced or distressed sale, any outstanding senior liens, any outstanding unpaid real estate taxes, transfer taxes and closing costs that would occur with sale of the real estate. If the Chief Credit Officer determines that a reasonable value cannot be derived based on available information, a new appraisal is ordered. The determination of the need for a new appraisal, versus completion of a property valuation by the Bank s Collections and Assigned Risk Department personnel, rests with the Chief Credit Officer and not the originating account officer.

When a loan is placed in non-accrual status, any outstanding interest is reversed against interest income. Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. Management uses a nine-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first six categories are considered not criticized. The first five pass categories are aggregated, while the pass-6, special mention, substandard and doubtful categories are disaggregated to separate pools. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard classification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize

 within a 12-month period. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass categories unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, delinquency, or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Company s commercial relationship managers are responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in their portfolios at origination and on an ongoing basis. Risk ratings are assigned by the account officer, but require independent review and rating concurrence from the Company s internal Loan Review Department. The Loan Review Department is an experienced, independent function which reports directly to the Board s Audit Committee. The scope of commercial portfolio coverage by the Loan Review Department is defined and presented to the Audit Committee for approval on an annual basis. The approved scope of coverage for the year ending December 31, 2024 requires review of approximately of the commercial loan portfolio. In addition to loan monitoring by the account officer and Loan Review Department, the Company also requires presentation of all credits rated pass-6 with aggregate balances greater than , all credits rated special mention or substandard with aggregate balances greater than , and all credits rated doubtful with aggregate balances greater than on an individual basis to the Company s Loan Loss Reserve Committee on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Asset Quality Task Force, which is a group comprised of senior level personnel, meets monthly to monitor the status of problem loans.

A variety of solutions are offered to borrowers, including loan modifications that may result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, or combinations thereof. Principal forgiveness includes principal and accrued interest forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the ACL. Interest rate reductions include modifications where the interest rate is reduced and interest is deferred. Term extensions extend the original contractual maturity date of the loan. Payment delays consist of modifications where we expect to collect the contractual amounts due but result in a delay in the receipt of payments specified under the original loan terms. We generally consider payment delays to be insignificant when the delay is three months or less.

 million and million, respectively. Interest Rate Hedges The Company has entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in order to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain floating-rate time deposit accounts. The hedge transactions allow the Company to add stability to interest expense and manage its exposure to interest rate movements. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss (within Shareholders Equity), net of tax, with a corresponding offset within other assets or other liabilities. Disclosures related to the fair value of the interest rate hedges can be found in Note 16. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the effective portion of changes in the fair value are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. The Company assesses the effectiveness of the hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged transactions. The Company did not recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on certain of the Company s variable rate time deposit accounts. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had and of gains, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had and of gains, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense.

The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their contractual amounts. The Bank uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which it is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through the provision (recovery) for credit losses line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses recovery on unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of while a provision for credit losses expense of and was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The participants have a vested interest in their accrued benefit after five full years of service. The benefits of the plan are based upon the employee s years of service and average annual earnings for the highest consecutive calendar years during the final period of employment.

The Company recognized a and settlement charge in connection with its defined benefit pension plan in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, while such charge was recognized in the same periods of 2023. A settlement charge must be recognized when the total dollar amount of lump sum distributions paid from the pension plan to retired employees exceeds a threshold of expected annual service and interest costs in the current year. It is important to note that since the retired employees have chosen to take lump sum payments, these individuals are no longer included in the pension plan. Therefore, the Company s basic annual pension expense is expected to be lower in the future. This was evident in 2023 and so far in 2024 as the Company has recognized a net periodic pension benefit in both years. The accrued pension obligation, which had a positive (debit) balance of million and million, was reclassified to other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The balance of the accrued pension obligation continues to be a positive value as a result of Company contributions to the plan and the revaluation of the obligation. The Company implemented a soft freeze of its defined benefit pension plan to provide that non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2013 and union employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 are not eligible to participate in the pension plan. Instead, such employees are eligible to participate in a qualified 401(k) plan. This change was made to help reduce pension costs in future periods.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments For the Company, as for most financial institutions, approximately of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments. Many of the Company s financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MD A THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 ..PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW .. The following table summarizes some of the Company s key performance indicators (in thousands, except per share and ratios). 

Three months ended Three months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income 1,183 647 Diluted earnings per share 0.07 0.04 Return on average assets (annualized) 0.34 0.19 Return on average equity (annualized) 4.51 2.49 The Company reported third quarter 2024 net income of 1,183,000, or 0.07 per diluted common share. This earnings performance represented a 536,000, or 82.8 , increase from the third quarter of 2023 when net income totaled 647,000, or 0.04 per diluted common share. The Company s community banking business continued to benefit from diversified revenue streams, with another quarter of strong revenue and profit contribution from our wealth management business. In addition, for the third quarter of 2024, earnings improvement was driven by the favorable comparison in the provision for credit losses and non-interest expense. ..NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN .. The Company s net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company s earnings, and it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table compares the Company s net interest income performance for the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023 (in thousands, except percentages): 

Three Three months ended months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Interest income 16,708 15,439 1,269 8.2 Interest expense 7,821 6,640 1,181 17.8 Net interest income 8,887 8,799 88 1.0 Net interest margin 2.71 2.76 (0.05) N/M 

 N/M not meaningful The Company's net interest income in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 88,000, or 1.0 , from the prior year's third quarter while the net interest margin of 2.71 for the third quarter of 2024 represents a five-basis point decrease from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease reflects net interest margin compression which has been prevalent in the banking industry since the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in an effort to control inflation. Additionally, contributing to net interest margin compression was the inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve. While the Company s net interest margin percentage in the third quarter of 2024 compares unfavorably to last year s third quarter, it did demonstrate relative stability so far in 2024 and was eight-basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. Total average loans in the third quarter of 2024 were higher than the 2023 third quarter average by 38.9 million, or 3.9 . During the third quarter of 2024, new loan originations slightly exceeded payoff activity and resulted in total loan volumes, on an end of period basis, increasing since June 30, 2024. Overall, total loans continue to be above the 1.0 billion threshold averaging 1.033 billion for the 2024 third quarter. The higher interest rate environment along with the higher average total loans outstanding resulted in total loan interest and fee income improving by 1.1 million, or 8.7 , for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Total investment securities averaged 254.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, which is 5.6 million, or 2.2 , lower than the 260.2 million average for the third quarter of last year. The decrease reflects management s strategy to allocate more cash flow from the securities portfolio to higher yielding loans while the Company controlled the amount of high cost overnight borrowed funds. Thus, new investment security purchases were primarily used to replace cash 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 flow from maturing securities to maintain appropriate balances for pledging purposes related to public funds deposits. The improved yields for new securities purchases along with management s execution of an investment portfolio repositioning strategy in late December 2023 caused interest income from investments to increase by 123,000, or 5.5 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income from investments was unfavorably impacted by the transfer of one corporate security into non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in a 73,000 reversal of previously recognized interest income. Overall, the 2024 third quarter balance of total average interest earning assets increased over last year s third quarter by 34.0 million, or 2.7 , while total interest income increased by 1.3 million, or 8.2 , since the third quarter of 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet, total average deposits of 1.165 billion for the third quarter of 2024 were 15.9 million, or 1.4 , higher than the 2023 third quarter average. The increase reflects the Company s successful business development efforts which more than offset a portion of the funds from the government stimulus programs leaving the balance sheet and greater pricing competition in the market to retain deposits because of the higher interest rates. The Company s core deposit base continued to demonstrate the strength and stability that it has had for many years. In addition to its loyal core deposit base, the Company has several other sources of liquidity, including a significant unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), overnight lines of credit at correspondent banks and access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The Company does not utilize brokered deposits as a funding source. The loan to deposit ratio averaged 88.7 in the third quarter of 2024, which indicates that the Company has ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio, and we believe that it is well positioned to support our customers and our community during times of economic volatility. Total interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 1.2 million, or 17.8 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to higher deposit and borrowings interest expense. Deposit interest expense was higher by 862,000, or 15.2 , while the third quarter 2024 average volume of total interest-bearing deposits grew from the 2023 third quarter average by 27.1 million, or 2.8 . The rising national interest rates in 2023 resulted in certain deposit products, particularly public funds, which are tied to a market index, repricing upward with the move in short-term interest rates causing interest expense to increase. Additionally, increased market competition resulted in the Company raising rates on certain shorter-term certificates of deposit to retain funds. Another factor contributing to net interest margin compression was an unfavorable deposit mix shift as the third quarter 2024 average of non-interest bearing demand deposits declined by 11.2 million, or 6.0 , while, as mentioned above, total interest-bearing deposits increased. For interest rate risk management purposes and to offset a portion of the unfavorable impact that rising funding costs are having on net interest income, management proactively executed 70 million of interest rate hedge transactions during 2023 to fix the cost of certain deposits that are indexed and move with short-term interest rates. Overall, total deposit cost averaged 2.22 for the third quarter of 2024, which is 27-basis points higher than total deposit cost of 1.95 for the third quarter of 2023. Total borrowings interest expense increased by 319,000, or 32.3 , when comparing the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. The increase primarily results from the impact that the higher interest rates had on total borrowings cost. While the Company s utilization of overnight borrowed funds in the third quarter of 2024 was lower than the same period of last year, the level of advances from the FHLB increased. Total short-term borrowings averaged 28.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 after averaging 36.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. Advances from the FHLB averaged 53.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 which is 33.0 million, or 161.1 , higher than the 20.5 million average in the third quarter of 2023. Management s strategy to increase term advances to lock in lower rates than overnight borrowings due to the inversion in the yield curve has favorably impacted net interest income. The table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and shareholders equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) the Company s interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) the Company s net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of this table, loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of 21 was used to compute tax-equivalent interest income and yields (non-GAAP). The tax equivalent adjustments to interest income on

 loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7,000 and 5,000, respectively, which is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure at the bottom of the table. Differences between the net interest spread and margin from a GAAP basis to a tax-equivalent basis were not material. Three months ended September 30 (In thousands, except percentages)

The Company recorded a 51,000 provision for credit losses recovery in the third quarter of 2024 after recognizing provision expense of 189,000 in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in a net favorable change of 240,000. The provision recovery in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects

Table of Contents 
 improved historical loss rates used to calculate the allowance for loan credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (CECL). ..NON-INTEREST INCOME .. Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 4.2 million and decreased by 53,000, or 1.2 , from the third quarter of 2023 performance. Factors contributing to the lower level of non-interest income for the quarter included: wealth management fees improved by 205,000, or 7.2 , due in part to a strong performance from our Financial Services division that resulted from new business growth. Also, the increase in wealth management fees reflects the improving market conditions particularly for equity securities as major market indexes continue their ascent to record highs in 2024; and a 159,000, or 23.4 , decrease in other income due primarily to the necessary adjustments to the fair value of a risk participation agreement as well as the credit valuation adjustment to the market value of the interest rate swap contracts that the Company executed to accommodate the needs of certain borrowers while managing our interest rate risk position. Specifically, these adjustments reflect the changing national interest rates which unfavorably impacted other income by 234,000 during the third quarter of 2024. 
 ..NON-INTEREST EXPENSE .. Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 11.7 million and decreased by 374,000, or 3.1 , from the prior year s third quarter. Factors contributing to the lower level of non-interest expense for the quarter included: a 354,000, or 30.9 , decrease in professional fees. Professional fees in both 2024 and 2023 were impacted by litigation and responses to the actions of an activist shareholder. The Company s activist related costs declined by approximately 400,000 when the third quarter of 2024 is compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a result of a Cooperation and Settlement Agreement reached with the activist shareholder, which was described in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 14, 2024, the Company anticipates that it will not incur any further activist related costs through the remainder of 2024; a 236,000, or 3.2 , decrease in salaries and employee benefits due to the net impact of certain items within this broad category. Total salaries cost was down by 48,000, or 0.9 , while health care cost was down by 37,000, or 3.8 , due to a lower level of full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the service cost associated with the Company s defined benefit pension plan decreased 116,000, or 35.5 . The reduced pension expense in the third quarter of 2024 reflects the retirement of employees who chose to take the lump sum distribution. These individuals are no longer included in the pension plan which favorably impacts the Company s basic pension expense; a 148,000, or 13.0 , increase in data processing and IT expense due to additional expenses related to monitoring our computing and network environment; and a 60,000, or 30.8 , increase in FDIC insurance due to an increase in both the asset assessment base as well as the assessment rate. 
 ..INCOME TAX EXPENSE .. The Company recorded income tax expense of 237,000, or an effective tax rate of 16.7 , in the third quarter of 2024. This compares to income tax expense of 124,000, or an effective tax rate of 16.1 , for the third quarter of 2023.

 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VS. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 ..PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW .. The following table summarizes some of the Company s key performance indicators (in thousands, except per share and ratios). 

Nine months ended Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income 2,712 1,975 Diluted earnings per share 0.16 0.12 Return on average assets 0.26 0.20 Return on average equity 3.52 2.53 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 2,712,000, or 0.16 per diluted common share. This represented a 37.3 increase in earnings from the nine-month period of 2023 when net income totaled 1,975,000, or 0.12 per diluted common share. Overall, the earnings improvement for the nine-month period in 2024 was driven by the favorable comparison in the provision for credit losses and non-interest expense which more than offset a lower level of total revenue. The Company s community banking business continued to benefit from diversified revenue streams, with total non-interest income representing 34 of total revenue for the first nine months of 2024. Both total average loans and deposits have grown this year, demonstrating the strength and loyalty of our customer base and helping to drive three consecutive quarters of net interest income improvement. The Company believes that its balance sheet is well positioned for further quarterly net interest income growth through the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. ..NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN .. The following table compares the Company s net interest income performance for the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023 (in thousands, except percentages): 

Nine months ended Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Change Interest income 49,442 44,892 4,550 10.1 Interest expense 22,933 17,461 5,472 31.3 Net interest income 26,509 27,431 (922) (3.4) Net interest margin 2.72 2.89 (0.17) N/M 

 N/M not meaningful The Company s net interest income in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 922,000, or 3.4 , from the prior year s first nine months while the net interest margin of 2.72 for the first nine months of 2024 represents a 17-basis point decline from the first nine months of 2023. As previously mentioned, the decrease reflects net interest margin compression which has been prevalent in the banking industry since the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy to control inflation and as the U.S. Treasury yield curve continues to be inverted. While the Company s net interest margin percentage compares unfavorably to last year, it did demonstrate relative stability so far in 2024 and has improved from its low point in the fourth quarter of 2023 which was 2.63 . With the Federal Reserve s action to begin easing monetary policy in September 2024, the Company believes the net interest margin will continue to improve in the remaining months of 2024 and into 2025. Total loans averaged 1.031 billion in the first nine months of 2024, which is higher than the 2023 average by 41.9 million, or 4.2 . So far in 2024, new loan originations have slightly exceeded payoff activity through nine months and resulted in total loan volumes, on an end of period basis, demonstrating modest growth since December 31, 2023. The higher interest rate environment along with the higher average total loans outstanding resulted in total loan interest and fee income improving by 4.0 million, or 10.6 , for the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023. Total investment securities averaged 255.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, which is 6.7 million, or 2.6 , lower than the 262.7 million average for the first nine months of last year. As previously mentioned, the decrease reflects management s strategy to allocate more cash flow from the securities portfolio to higher yielding loans while the 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 Company controlled the amount of high cost overnight borrowed funds. Thus, new investment security purchases were primarily used to replace cash flow from maturing securities to maintain appropriate balances for pledging purposes related to public funds deposits. The improved yields for new securities purchases along with management s execution of an investment portfolio repositioning strategy in late December 2023 caused interest income from investments to increase by 512,000, or 7.7 . Interest income from investments was unfavorably impacted by the transfer of one corporate security into non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in a 73,000 reversal of previously recognized interest income. Overall, the 2024 first nine-month average balance of total interest earning assets increased since last year s nine-month average by 35.3 million, or 2.8 , while total interest income increased by 4.6 million, or 10.1 , since the first nine months of 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet, through nine months, total average deposits were 10.5 million, or 0.9 , higher compared to total average deposits in the first nine months of 2023. The increase since last year is reflective of the Company s successful business development efforts despite greater pricing competition in the market to obtain/retain deposits because of higher interest rates which more than offset a portion of the funds from the government stimulus programs leaving the balance sheet. As previously mentioned, the Company s core deposit base continued to demonstrate the strength and stability that it has had for many years. On September 30, 2024, total deposits grew by 31.0 million, or 2.7 , since December 31, 2023, demonstrating what we believe is customer loyalty and confidence in AmeriServ Financial Bank. Total interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 5.5 million, or 31.3 , when compared to the first nine months of 2023, due to higher deposit and borrowings interest expense. Deposit interest expense was higher by 4.2 million, or 28.5 , while the first nine months of 2024 average volume of total interest-bearing deposits grew by 26.5 million, or 2.8 . The rising national interest rates in 2023 resulted in certain deposit products, particularly public funds, which are tied to a market index, repricing upward with the move in short-term interest rates causing interest expense to increase. Additionally, increased market competition resulted in the Company raising rates on certain shorter-term certificates of deposit to retain funds. Another factor contributing to net interest margin compression was an unfavorable deposit mix shift as the first nine months of 2024 average of non-interest bearing demand deposits declined by 16.0 million, or 8.2 , while, as mentioned above, total interest-bearing deposits increased. Finally, the increasing trend in total deposit costs experienced since the Federal Reserve began to tighten monetary policy slowed in 2024 with the Federal Open Market Committee keeping the Fed Funds rate stable since July 2023 until their action to ease monetary policy in September 2024. This slowdown in deposit costs has contributed to the recent stabilization and improvement in the net interest margin. Management believes that deposit costs will improve as the Federal Reserve continues their expected tempered approach to reduce interest rates. Overall, total deposit cost averaged 2.19 in the first nine months of 2024, which is 47-basis points higher than total deposit cost of 1.72 for the first nine months of 2023. Total borrowings interest expense increased by 1.2 million, or 47.3 , when comparing the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023. The increase primarily results from the impact that the higher interest rates had on total borrowings cost. The Company s utilization of overnight borrowed funds so far in 2024 has been lower than the 2023 level while the level of advances from the FHLB have increased. Total short-term borrowings averaged 30.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 after averaging 33.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. Advances from the FHLB averaged 50.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 which is 31.9 million, or 169.8 , higher than the 18.8 million average in the first nine months of 2023. Management s strategy to increase term advances to lock in lower rates than overnight borrowings due to the inversion in the yield curve has favorably impacted net interest income. The table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For a detailed discussion of the components and assumptions included in the table, see the paragraph before the quarterly table on page 42. The tax equivalent adjustments to interest income on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 19,000 and 10,000, respectively, which is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure at the bottom of the table. Differences between the net interest spread and margin from a GAAP basis to a tax-equivalent basis were not material.

For the first nine months of 2024, the Company recognized a 174,000 provision for credit losses recovery after recognizing 1.4 million of provision expense in the first nine months of 2023, resulting in a net favorable change of 1.6 million. The provision for credit losses recovery for the nine-month timeframe of 2024 reflects recoveries recognized for both the loan and securities portfolios. Specifically, a 145,000 recovery from the loan portfolio occurred primarily due to a favorable adjustment to the loss and qualitative factors used to calculate the allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (CECL). Within the investment portfolio, a 435,000 recovery was recognized on a 926,000 reserve that was established in the first quarter of 2023 for a Signature Bank subordinated debt investment after the bond was successfully sold in the first 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 quarter of 2024. These recoveries more than offset a 360,000 reserve established for an available for sale corporate security and an additional 50,000 that was contributed to the reserve for HTM securities in accordance with CECL. ..NON-INTEREST INCOME .. Non-interest income for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 13.5 million and declined by 103,000, or 0.8 , from the first nine months of 2023 performance. Factors contributing to the lower level of non-interest income for the nine-month period included: during the first quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a 1.7 million gain from AmeriServ Financial Bank selling all 7,859 shares of Class B common stock of Visa Inc. There was no such gain during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024; wealth management fees improved by 1.0 million, or 12.0 , due in part to a strong performance from our Financial Services division that resulted from new business growth. Also, the increase in wealth management fees reflects the improving market conditions particularly for equity securities as major market indexes continue their ascent to record highs in 2024. Overall, the fair market value of wealth management assets totaled 2.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and increased by 218.3 million, or 9.1 , since September 30, 2023; and a 590,000, or 36.5 , increase in other income due to the necessary adjustments to the fair value of a risk participation agreement as well as the credit valuation adjustment to the market value of the interest rate swap contracts that the Company executed to accommodate the needs of certain borrowers while managing our interest rate risk position. These adjustments reflect the changing national interest rates which favorably impacted the nine-month period by 188,000. Also favorably impacting other income was the Company recognizing a 250,000 signing bonus in 2024 that resulted from successful negotiations related to the renewal of an expiring contract with Visa. 
 ..NON-INTEREST EXPENSE .. Non-interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 36.9 million and decreased by 353,000, or 0.9 , from the prior year s first nine months. Factors contributing to the lower level of non-interest expense for the nine-month period included: a 914,000, or 4.1 , decrease in salaries and employee benefits due to the net impact of certain items within this broad category. Total salaries cost was down by 641,000, or 4.1 , after the Company incurred additional salary expense in 2023 related to a strategy to consolidate certain executive level positions in the wealth management business. Total health care cost was 459,000, or 15.9 , lower compared to last year and reflects management s effective negotiations with our current health care provider that resulted in not having to recognize any premium costs in January 2024. These favorable items were partially offset by an increased level of incentive compensation by 343,000, or 41.2 , which corresponds to the strong performance of our wealth management division; a 517,000, or 26.7 , increase in other expense due primarily to the recognition of a pension settlement charge totaling 410,000 in 2024. A settlement charge must be recognized when the total dollar amount of lump sum distributions paid from the pension plan to retired employees exceeds a threshold of expected annual service and interest costs in the current year; a 473,000, or 10.8 , decrease in professional fees. Professional fees in both 2024 and 2023 were impacted by litigation and responses to the actions of an activist shareholder. These activist related costs amounted to 1.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the first nine months of 2023 as a Cooperation and Settlement Agreement was reached with the activist shareholder in June 2024; a 291,000, or 8.8 , increase in data processing and IT expense due to additional expenses related to monitoring our computing and network environment; and a 265,000, or 53.5 , increase in FDIC insurance due to an increase in both the asset assessment base as well as the assessment rate.

 ..INCOME TAX EXPENSE .. The Company recorded an income tax expense of 611,000, or an effective tax rate of 18.4 , in the first nine months of 2024. This compares to an income tax expense of 435,000, or an effective tax rate of 18.0 , for the first nine months of 2023. The higher level of income tax expense this year is due to the increased level of pre-tax income. ..SEGMENT RESULTS. .. The community banking segment reported a net income contribution of 13,484,000 in the nine months of 2024 which was 1,319,000 higher than the net income contribution in the nine months of 2023. The increase between time periods results from the strength that this segment provides to the Company which was determined by a thorough funds transfer pricing analysis. In short, a funds transfer pricing analysis determines how funding (deposits) and use of this funding (loans) by each segment contributes to the overall profitability of the Company by providing an estimated positive or negative dollar value of the segment s contribution to the Company. Overall, the funds transfer pricing analysis indicated that the community banking segment provided an additional 1.5 million benefit to the Company in the nine months of 2024 when compared to the nine months of 2023. Despite this benefit that community banking provides, this segment was unfavorably impacted from net interest margin compression as total deposit interest expense increased to a higher level than the increase to total loan interest income by 209,000. Contributing to the net interest margin compression experienced by the Company was an unfavorable deposit mix shift as exhibited by the nine-month average of non-interest-bearing demand deposits declining by 16.0 million, or 8.2 , while total interest-bearing deposits increased by 26.5 million, or 2.8 . This segment benefitted from a higher level of total average loans in the nine months of 2024 by 41.9 million, or 4.2 . Growth occurred primarily in the commercial real estate category with modest growth occurring in residential mortgage and home equity loans. Overall, total loan interest income improved by 4.0 million, or 10.6 , for the nine months of 2024 when compared to the nine months of last year. Deposit interest expense was higher by 4.2 million, or 28.5 , while, as mentioned above, the 2024 nine-month average volume of total interest-bearing deposits increased by 26.5 million, or 2.8 . The higher national interest rates along with increased market competition to retain and attract deposits contributed to deposit costs increasing. This segment was favorably impacted by the Company recording a 149,000 recovery for the allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio and unfunded commitments in the nine months of 2024 compared to 567,000 of provision expense for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments in last year s nine months. Non-interest income increased due to the Company recognizing a 250,000 signing bonus that resulted from successful negotiations related to the renewal of an expiring contract with Visa. Also, this segment was favorably impacted by the necessary adjustment to the fair market value of an interest rate swap related risk participation agreement as well as the credit valuation adjustment to the market value of the interest rate swap contracts that the Company executed to accommodate the needs of certain commercial borrowers while managing our interest rate risk position. Non-interest expense, within the community banking segment, in the nine months of 2024 compares unfavorably to last year s nine months due to a higher level of FDIC deposit insurance expense and higher data processing and IT related costs. The wealth management segment s net income contribution increased by 1.2 million in the nine months of 2024 from the nine months of 2023. The increase reflects the strong performance from the Financial Services division that resulted from new business growth. In addition, wealth management fees increased due to the improving market conditions particularly for equity securities as the major market indexes continue their ascent to record highs in 2024. Overall, wealth management revenues reached a historically high level. Also contributing to the higher level of net income for this segment were lower levels of salaries expense and health care costs. Partially offsetting the improvement in wealth management revenue cost for the nine-month period were higher levels of professional fees and incentive compensation. The investment/parent segment reported a net loss of 12,904,000 in the nine months of 2024 which is greater than the net loss of 11,097,000 in the nine months of 2023 by 1,807,000. The funds transfer pricing analysis caused the loss reported within this segment to be higher due to the inverted yield curve and the higher funding costs on our balance sheet. Also contributing to the higher net loss for this segment was the 1.7 million gain recognized during the first quarter of 2023 from the sale of the Class B common stock of Visa Inc. while there was no such gain in 2024. This segment did experience an 869,000 favorable shift from the Bank recognizing a 435,000 provision recovery in 2024 from the subordinated debt investment with Signature Bank after a 926,000 provision expense was recognized on this same investment in the first quarter of 2023. This segment was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of 360,000 of provision expense in 2024 to establish a reserve for an available for sale (AFS) corporate security. This segment was also unfavorably impacted by 1,230,000 of additional total borrowings interest expense due to the higher average balance of FHLB term borrowings. Professional fees in both 2024 and 2023 were impacted by litigation and responses to

 the actions of an activist shareholder. These activist related costs amounted to 1.5 million for the nine months of 2024 compared to activist costs of 2.0 million for the nine months of 2023. Favorably impacting net income for this segment was an increased level of interest income from investment securities by 512,000 as the higher interest rates and a portfolio restructuring in late 2023 resulted in an improved overall total securities yield. ..BALANCE SHEET .. The Company s total consolidated assets were 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, which increased by 15.5 million, or 1.1 , from the December 31, 2023 asset level. This change was related, primarily, to increased levels of cash and cash equivalents, total loans, leases, other real estate owned (OREO) and repossessed assets and other assets. Specifically, total loans increased by 2.0 million, or 0.2 , as so far in 2024, new loan originations have only slightly exceeded payoff activity. The marginal growth in loans along with an increase in total deposits led to an 8.1 million, or 57.7 , increase in cash and cash equivalents. The 953,000, or 31.5 , increase in the right-of-use asset for operating and financing leases resulted from the execution of two new leases for office locations and one new lease for equipment during 2024. OREO and repossessed assets increased 1.8 million due primarily to the foreclosure of a non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan secured by an office property during the second quarter of 2024. Finally, other assets increased 2.7 million, or 7.3 , due to an increase in the positive balance of the accrued pension liability which was partially offset by a decrease in the market values for the interest rate swaps. Total deposits increased by 31.0 million, or 2.7 , in the first nine months of 2024. We believe this demonstrates customer confidence and the strength and loyalty of our core deposit base. As of September 30, 2024, the 25 largest depositors represented 25.3 of total deposits, which is an increase from December 31, 2023, when it was 22.4 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated amount of uninsured deposits was 420.9 million and 384.5 million, respectively. The estimate of uninsured deposits was done at the single account level and does not take into account total customer balances in the Bank. It should be noted that approximately 50 of these uninsured deposits relate to public funds from municipalities, government entities, and school districts which by law are required to be collateralized by investment securities or FHLB letters of credit to protect these depositor funds. Total short-term and FHLB borrowings were reduced by 19.2 million, or 22.5 , since year-end 2023 as a decrease in short-term borrowings more than offset an increase in FHLB term advances. Specifically, short-term borrowings decreased by 29.2 million, or 71.3 . Given the high cost of overnight borrowed funds, management has been effectively controlling the usage of this funding source. In addition, the inversion in the yield curve has caused FHLB term advances to have rates that are lower than the cost of overnight borrowed funds. Therefore, management increased usage of FHLB term advances in the first nine months of 2024 leading to an increase of 10.0 million, or 22.4 . The Company s total shareholders equity increased by 5.9 million, or 5.8 , during the first nine months of 2024. The increase in capital is the result of the Company s earnings performance during the first nine months of 2024 more than offsetting our common stock dividend payments to shareholders. In addition, the pension adjustment and improved market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio had a positive impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss. Partially offsetting these positive items was the execution of a Stock Repurchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company repurchased, at current market price, 628,003 shares of common stock from Driver Opportunity Partners, in connection with a settlement agreement, reducing capital by 1.5 million. The Company continues to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a total capital ratio of 12.87 , and a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 9.33 at September 30, 2024. See the discussion of the Basel III capital requirements under the Capital Resources section below. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s book value per common share was 6.55 and its tangible book value per common share was 5.72 (1) . When compared to December 31, 2023, book value per common share increased by 0.59, or 9.9 , and tangible book value per common share increased by 0.56 per common share, or 10.9 . The improvement in the Company s book value and tangible book value per share during 2024 was largely due to the favorable adjustment for both the unrealized loss on available for sale securities and the Company s defined benefit pension plan as well as the accretive repurchase of 628,003 shares of our common stock from the activist shareholder. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.79 (1) at September 30, 2024 and increased by 35-basis points when compared to December 31, 2023.

 ..LOAN QUALITY .. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company s loan delinquency, non-performing loans, and classified loans (in thousands, except percentages): 

September 30, December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2023 Total accruing loan delinquency 5,421 1,818 1,089 Total non-accrual loans 9,807 12,167 5,918 Total non-performing loans 9,819 12,378 6,194 Accruing loan delinquency, as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income 0.52 0.18 0.11 Non-accrual loans, as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income 0.94 1.17 0.59 Non-performing loans, as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income 0.94 1.19 0.62 Non-performing loans as a percentage of total assets 0.70 0.89 0.45 As a percent of average loans, net of unearned income: Annualized net charge-offs 0.06 0.35 0.03 Annualized provision (recovery) for credit losses - loans (0.02) 0.66 0.07 Total classified loans (loans rated substandard or doubtful) 19,244 24,996 25,299 

 Non-performing loans are comprised of loans that are on a non-accrual basis and loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments. Total classified loans include non-performing residential mortgage and consumer loans. The increase in accruing loan delinquency since year-end 2023 is attributable to an increase in commercial real estate loan delinquency due to slow payments on a 3.6 million urban office loan for which the Company has already established a specific reserve for credit losses allocation of 1.6 million. Non-performing loans decreased from 12.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 9.8 million at September 30, 2024 due to a reduction in non-accrual loans as well as loans past due 90 days or more still accruing. Primarily, the foreclosure and transfer to other real estate owned (OREO), during the second quarter of 2024, of a commercial office building which secured a 1.5 million non-accrual commercial real estate loan contributed to this decrease. The aforementioned transfer to OREO along with the risk rating upgrade of a 3.6 million non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan and normal paydown activity contributed to a decrease in classified loans. Specifically, classified loans decreased 5.8 million, or 23.0 , from December 31, 2023 and totaled 19.2 million at September 30, 2024. Non-performing assets from the loan portfolio, which include OREO and repossessed assets, were 1.12 of total loans as of September 30, 2024. The Company recognized net loan charge-offs of 488,000, or 0.06 of total average loans, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net loan charge-offs of 187,000, or 0.03 of total average loans, in the first nine months of 2023. We also continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the number of relatively large-sized commercial and commercial real estate loans within the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the 25 largest credits represented 22.5 of total loans outstanding, which is relatively consistent with December 31, 2023 when it was 22.7 .

 Commercial Real Estate Loan Exposure A significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans, including owner occupied properties, non-owner-occupied properties, and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans and depend on cash flows from the owner s business or the property s tenants to service the debt. The borrower s cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the market where the property is located, any of which could increase the likelihood of default. Commercial real estate loans also typically have larger loan balances, and, therefore, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of the Company's non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for credit losses for loans, and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. The banking regulatory agencies have recently expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement enhanced risk management practices, including stricter underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, more granular reporting, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for credit losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. If the Company's banking regulators determine that our commercial real estate lending activities are particularly risky and are subject to such heightened scrutiny, the Company may incur significant additional costs or be required to restrict certain of our commercial real estate lending activities. Furthermore, failures in the Company's risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is a particular emphasis on ensuring that the subsidiary bank has appropriate levels of capital to support its non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan concentration, which stood at 388 as of September 30, 2024. It should be noted that this ratio increased from 375 at December 31, 2023 due to the growth in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan balances out pacing the increase in total regulatory capital. Further, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans represented 51.3 and 49.3 of total loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The commercial real estate loan segment includes the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan classes of retail, multi-family, and other. The following table presents our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio by property type.

 ..ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES .. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses and certain ratios for the periods ended (in thousands, except percentages): 

September 30, December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2023 Allowance for credit losses - loans 14,420 15,053 12,313 Allowance for credit losses - loans as a percentage of each of the following: total loans, net of unearned income 1.39 1.45 1.23 total non-accrual loans 147.04 123.72 208.06 total non-performing loans 146.86 121.61 198.79 Allowance for credit losses - securities 448 963 958 Allowance for credit losses - unfunded loan commitments 936 940 937 The allowance for loan credit losses declined since December 31, 2023 by 633,000, or 4.2 , to 14.4 million at September 30, 2024. Even with this modest decrease, the allowance for loan credit losses is 2.1 million, or 17.1 , higher than the allowance for loan credit losses at September 30, 2023. The increase since last year s third quarter end was due to the Company strengthening its allowance for loan credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2023. Overall, the Company continues to maintain solid coverage of both total loans and non-performing loans as the allowance for loan credit losses provided 147 coverage of non-performing loans and 1.39 of total loans at September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on the investment securities portfolio was comprised of 360,000 on available for sale securities and 88,000 on held to maturity securities as of September 30, 2024. This compares to 926,000 on available for sale securities and 37,000 on held to maturity securities as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on available for sale securities decreased 566,000, or 61.1 , since year-end 2023 due to the successful sale of the Signature Bank subordinated debt investment which was partially offset by the establishment of an allowance for credit losses on another corporate available for sale security that was deemed to be credit impaired in 2024. ..LIQUIDITY .. The Company s liquidity position continues to be strong. Total average deposits were 10.5 million, or 0.9 , higher when compared to the 2023 first nine-month average. The increase reflects the Company s successful business development efforts which more than offset a portion of the funds from the government stimulus programs leaving the balance sheet and greater pricing competition in the market to retain deposits because of the higher interest rates. The Company s core deposit base continued to demonstrate the strength and stability that it has had for many years. On September 30, 2024, total deposits grew by 31.0 million, or 2.7 , since December 31, 2023, demonstrating customer loyalty and confidence in AmeriServ Financial Bank. In addition to its loyal core deposit base, the Company has several other sources of liquidity, including a significant unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), overnight lines of credit at correspondent banks and access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The Company does not utilize brokered deposits as a funding source. Overall, deposit volumes continue to remain at a high level. The core deposit base is adequate to fund the Company s operations. Cash flow from maturities, prepayments and amortization of securities is used to help fund loan growth. Average short-term investments remained relatively stable in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of last year, increasing slightly by 69,000, or 1.8 . Advances from the FHLB averaged 50.7 million in the nine months of 2024 which is 31.9 million, or 169.8 , higher than the 18.8 million average in the nine months of 2023. Management s strategy to increase term advances to lock in lower rates than overnight borrowings due to the inversion in the yield curve has favorably impacted net interest income. Management continues to monitor the changing economic conditions and adjust pricing strategies accordingly which largely determines customer behavior and the level of total deposits as well as shifts within the total deposit mix. Also, diligent monitoring and management of our short-term investment position and our level of overnight borrowed funds remains a priority. Given the high cost of overnight borrowed funds, management has been effectively controlling the usage of this funding source. The Company s utilization of overnight borrowed funds so far in 2024 has been lower than the 2023 level. Total fed funds purchased and other short-term borrowings averaged 30.2 million for the nine months of 2024 after averaging 33.9 million for the nine months of 2023. Continued loan growth and prudent investment in securities are critical to achieve the best return on the normal level of earning asset cash flow that occurs each month. So far in 2024, purchases of securities have continued to follow the same trend exhibited during the full year of 2023. Securities purchases have been slow as more

 funds have been allocated to the loan portfolio. Loan pipelines are currently at a typical level. Total average loans in the nine months of 2024 were higher than the 2023 nine-month average by 41.9 million, or 4.2 . We strive to operate our loan to deposit ratio in a range of 80 to 100 . The Company s loan to deposit ratio averaged 88.7 in the third quarter of 2024, which indicates that the Company has ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio and is strongly positioned to support our customers and our community during times of economic volatility. We are also well positioned to service our existing loan pipeline and grow our loan to deposit ratio while remaining within our guideline parameters. Liquidity can also be analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 8.1 million from December 31, 2023, to 22.1 million at September 30, 2024, due to 8.6 million of net cash provided by financing activities and 155,000 of net cash provided by investing activities which more than offset 685,000 of net cash used in operating activities. Within investing activities, cash advanced for new loans originated totaled 129.0 million and was 3.7 million higher than the 125.3 million of cash received from loan principal payments. Within financing activities, total short-term borrowings decreased by 29.2 million, total borrowings on advances from FHLB increased by 10.0 million while total deposits increased by 31.0 million. The holding company had 6.3 million of cash, short-term investments, and investment securities at September 30, 2024, which represented a 1.9 million decrease from the holding company s cash position since December 31, 2023. Dividend payments from our subsidiaries provided ongoing cash to the holding company. At September 30, 2024, our subsidiary Bank had 2.0 million of cash available for immediate dividends to the holding company under applicable regulatory formulas. Management follows a policy that limits dividend payments from the Trust Company to 75 of annual net income. Overall, we believe that the holding company has sufficient liquidity to meet its subordinated debt interest payments and its dividend payments on its common stock. Financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements of depositors and borrowers, take advantage of market opportunities, and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Sources of asset liquidity are provided by short-term investments, interest bearing deposits with banks, and federal funds sold. These assets totaled 22.1 million and 14.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Maturing and repaying loans, as well as the monthly cash flow associated with mortgage-backed securities and security maturities are other significant sources of asset liquidity for the Company. Liability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with competitive rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal funds, or utilizing the facilities of the Federal Reserve or the FHLB systems. The Company utilizes a variety of these methods of liability liquidity. Additionally, the Company s subsidiary bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides the opportunity to obtain short-term to longer-term advances based upon the Company s investment in certain residential mortgage, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 299 million of overnight borrowing availability at the FHLB, 43 million of short-term borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve Bank and 35 million of unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company believes it has ample liquidity available to fund outstanding loan commitments if they were fully drawn upon. ..CAPITAL RESOURCES .. The Bank meaningfully exceeds all regulatory capital ratios for each of the periods presented and is considered well capitalized. The Company s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.33 , the tier 1 capital ratio was 9.33 , and the total capital ratio was 12.87 at September 30, 2024. The Company s tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.75 at September 30, 2024. We anticipate that we will maintain our strong capital ratios throughout the remainder of 2024. The Basel III capital standards establish the minimum capital levels in addition to the well capitalized requirements under the federal banking regulations prompt corrective action. The capital rules also impose a 2.5 capital conservation buffer (CCB) on top of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the CCB is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution s eligible retained income (four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). The Company and the Bank meet all capital

 requirements, including the CCB, and continue to be committed to maintaining strong capital levels that exceed regulatory requirements while also supporting balance sheet growth and providing a return to our shareholders. Under the Basel III capital standards, the minimum capital ratios are: 

MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO MINIMUM PLUS CAPITAL CAPITAL RATIO CONSERVATION BUFFER Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 7.0 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 8.5 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 10.5 Tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets 4.0 N/A Our focus is on preserving capital to support customer lending and allow the Company to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We currently believe that we have sufficient capital and earnings power to continue to pay our common stock cash dividend at its current rate of 0.03 per quarter. The Company had a book value of 6.55 per common share and a tangible book value of 5.72 (1) per common share on September 30, 2024. In addition, our tangible common equity ratio was 6.79 (1) . At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 16.5 million common shares outstanding. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with Driver Opportunity Partners (Driver), in connection with a settlement agreement. Under the stock purchase agreement, the Company repurchased 628,003 shares of common stock from Driver at a per share price of 2.38. Because these shares were acquired at a price below tangible book value, the stock repurchase was accretive to shareholders. The Company does not expect to execute any additional stock repurchases in 2024. 

 (1) Non-GAAP financial information, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in this MD A. ..INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY .. The following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the Company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. The interest rate scenarios in the table compare the Company s base forecast, which was prepared using a flat interest rate scenario, to scenarios that reflect immediate interest rate changes of 100 and 200 basis points. Each rate scenario contains unique prepayment and repricing assumptions that are applied to the Company s existing balance sheet that was developed under the flat interest rate scenario. 

INTEREST RATE SCENARIO VARIABILITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO EQUITY 200 bp increase (1.1) 4.5 100 bp increase (0.4) 3.4 100 bp decrease (6.2) 200 bp decrease (0.6) (15.6) The Company believes that its overall interest rate risk position is well controlled. The execution of 70 million of interest rate hedges during 2023, in order to fix the cost of certain deposits that are indexed and move with short-term interest rates, reduced the Company s negative variability of net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and helped slow net interest margin compression. The fed funds rate is currently at a targeted range of 4.75 to 5.00 as the Federal Reserve took action in September 2024 to ease monetary policy. The 50-basis point decrease to the target fed funds rate was the Federal Open Market Committee s first change to interest rates since the third quarter of 2023. The variability of net interest income was slightly negative in the upward rate scenarios as the Company was marginally more exposed to liabilities repricing upward to a greater extent than assets. Specifically, the cost of funds was immediately impacted when short-term national interest rates increase because certain deposit products and overnight borrowed funds move with the market. This was partially offset by the Company s investment securities portfolio and the scheduled repricing of loans tied to an index, such as SOFR or prime. In addition to the interest rate hedges discussed

 above, the Company has effectively utilized interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management purposes. The interest rate swaps allow our customers to lock in fixed interest rates while the Company retains the benefit of interest rates moving with the market. Regarding interest bearing liabilities, the Company will continue its disciplined approach to price its core deposit accounts in a controlled but competitive manner and control the amount of overnight borrowed funds. Overall, based on the slight change in the variability of net interest income in the various interest rate scenarios, the Company is well positioned to sustain either a rate increase or decrease. The market value of portfolio equity increases in the upward rate shocks due to the improved value of the Company s core deposit base. Negative variability of market value of portfolio equity occurs in the downward rate shocks due to a reduced value for core deposits. ..OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS .. The Company incurs off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments and standby letters of credit involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company had various outstanding commitments to extend credit approximating 250.1 million and standby letters of credit of 8.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their contractual amounts. The Company uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending. ..RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES .. This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are considered to be non-GAAP measures and are calculated by dividing tangible common equity by tangible assets or shares outstanding. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in understanding its financial condition. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures, and, because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. The following table sets forth the calculation of the Company s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except share and ratio data): 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Total shareholders equity 108,182 102,277 Less: Intangible assets 13,693 13,712 Tangible common equity 94,489 88,565 Total assets 1,405,187 1,389,638 Less: Intangible assets 13,693 13,712 Tangible assets 1,391,494 1,375,926 Tangible common equity ratio (non-GAAP) 6.79 6.44 Total shares outstanding 16,519,267 17,147,270 Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) 5.72 5.16 ..CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES .. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting and reporting policies for the pension liability, allowance for credit losses (related to investment securities, loans, and unfunded commitments), and derivatives (interest rate swaps/hedges) are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in material changes in the Company s financial position or results of operation. 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 ACCOUNT Pension liability BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Other assets INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Salaries and employee benefits and Other expense DESCRIPTION Pension costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation of future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Company s pension obligations and future expense. Additionally, pension expense can also be impacted by settlement accounting charges if the amount of employee selected lump sum distributions exceed the total amount of service and interest component costs of the net periodic pension cost in a particular year. Our pension benefits are described further in Note 15 of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. ACCOUNT Allowance for Credit Losses BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses, Allowance for credit losses loans, Other liabilities INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Provision (recovery) for credit losses DESCRIPTION Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses and subsequent related updates. This standard requires the Company to measure the current expected credit losses (CECL) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and held to maturity (HTM) securities, and off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded commitments. In addition, ASC 326 requires credit losses on available for sale (AFS) debt securities to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down when management does not intend to sell or believes that it is not more likely than not they will be required to sell the security. The Company measures expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities, which are comprised of U.S. government agency and mortgage-backed securities as well as taxable municipal, corporate, and other bonds. The Company s agency and mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government entities and agencies and are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses. As such, no allowance for credit losses has been established for these securities. The allowance for credit losses on the taxable municipal, corporate, and other bonds within the held to maturity securities portfolio is calculated using the PD/LGD method. The calculation is completed on a quarterly basis using the default studies provided by an industry leading source. Based on management judgment, certain qualitative adjustments, such as the Company s historical loss experience and/or the issuer s credit quality, may be applied. The Company measures expected credit losses on available for sale debt securities when the Company does not intend to sell, or when it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available for sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, equal to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.

Table of Contents 
 The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation reserve established and maintained by charges against income and is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the ACL when they are deemed uncollectible. The ACL is an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of a loan, that considers our historical loss experience, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Determination of an appropriate ACL is inherently subjective and may have significant changes from period to period. The methodology for determining the ACL has two main components: evaluation of expected credit losses for certain groups of homogeneous loans that share similar risk characteristics and evaluation of loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans. The allowance for credit losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb current expected credit losses. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this quarterly evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates. This process also considers economic conditions, for a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which it is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. ACCOUNT Derivatives (interest rate swaps/hedges) BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Other assets and Other liabilities INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Other income DESCRIPTION The Company periodically enters into derivative instruments to meet the financing, interest rate and equity risk management needs of its customers or the Bank. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective as hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive loss, net of deferred taxes and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness would be recognized in the income statement line item pertaining to the hedged item. To accommodate the needs of our customers and support the Company s asset/liability positioning, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with customers and a large financial institution that specializes in these types of transactions. The Company enters into offsetting positions to minimize interest rate and equity risk to the Company. These derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value with any resulting gain or loss recorded in current period earnings in amounts that offset. These instruments and their offsetting positions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ..FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT ..

Exhibit 15.1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors AmeriServ Financial, Inc. Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AmeriServ Financial, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and changes in shareholders equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the interim financial statements). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated March 27, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. /s/S.R.
