 In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), the Company assesses whether it has a variable interest in legal entities in which it has a financial interest and, if so, whether or not those entities are VIEs. For those entities that qualify as VIEs, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and if so, to consolidate the VIE. 
 
 The Company holds variable interests in legal entities that contract with physicians and other health professionals that provide services on behalf of the Company. These entities are considered VIEs since they do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support. An enterprise having a controlling financial interest in a VIE must consolidate the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary, meaning it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE s economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). The Company has the power and rights to control all activities of its VIEs and funds and absorbs all losses of its VIEs. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of its VIEs and therefore appropriately consolidates its VIEs.

The first action is a class complaint filed on December 14, 2023. Similar to the Lowe Action, it alleges various wage and hour claims on behalf of the plaintiff and a putative class and asserts a derivative class claim for violations of California s Unfair Competition Law. The second action brought by Corielyn Hall was filed on February 20, 2024 and brings claims under PAGA. 
 
 At the time of this filing, the Company is participating in early mediation with the plaintiffs in the California Labor Actions. Given the overlapping claims and time periods presented in the California Labor Actions, these actions will be mediated concurrently in an effort to reach a global resolution. The Company believes there are substantial defenses to the claims alleged in California Labor Actions. Due to the early stage of these proceedings, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims if they cannot be resolved during mediation.

 Overview 
 The Company is a mobile healthcare services company that uses proprietary dispatch and communication technology to help provide (i) quality mobile, in-person medical treatment directly to patients in the comfort of their homes, workplaces and other non-traditional locations; and (ii) medical transportation in major metropolitan cities in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
 
 The Company derives revenue primarily from two operating segments: 
 
 Mobile Health Services: The services offered by this segment include a wide variety of healthcare services performed at homes, offices and other locations and event services such as on-site healthcare support at sporting events and concerts. This segment also provides total care management solutions to large, typically underserved population groups, primarily through arrangements with municipalities, which include healthcare services as well as ancillary services, such as shelter. 
 
 Transportation Services: The services offered by this segment encompass both emergency response and non-emergency transport services. Non-emergency transport services include ambulance transports and wheelchair transports. Net revenue from Transportation Services is derived from the transportation of patients based on billings to third party payors and healthcare facilities. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of 4.5 million, compared to net income of 4.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of 21.0 million, compared to net income of 2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 
 Our operating results and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including, among others, our ability to establish, maintain and grow customer relationships; our ability to execute projects to the satisfaction of our customers; conditions in the healthcare transportation and mobile health services markets; changes in government spending on healthcare and other social services; availability of healthcare professionals and other personnel; changes in the cost of labor; our competitive environment; overall macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including the interest rate environment, the inflationary environment, the potential recessionary environment, regional conflict and tensions, financial institution instability and the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government; production schedules of our suppliers; our ability to obtain or maintain operating licenses; and the success of our acquisition strategy. Some of these key factors are briefly discussed below. Future revenue growth and improvement in operating results will be largely contingent on our ability to penetrate new markets and further penetrate existing markets, which is subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 Healthcare Services Market 
 The Mobile Health Services market is dependent on several factors, including increased patient acceptance of services that are provided outside of traditional healthcare facilities, such as in homes, businesses or other designated locations; healthcare coverage of the various Mobile Health Services; and continued desire on the part of government and municipal entities to fund programs to assist currently underserved patient segments via population health programs. These programs have increased in number, scale and scope since the beginning of COVID-19. While COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs have been dramatically scaled back from their levels at the pandemic s peak, there have been expansions of these population health programs into other areas, such as the provision of healthcare and related services to recent migrants and asylum seekers. 
 The Transportation Services market is highly dependent on patients requiring transportation after surgeries and other medical procedures and treatments. The Company primarily focuses on the non-emergency medical transport market, which includes services that are provided to patients who need assistance getting to and from medical appointments. Key drivers of this market are the increase in chronic conditions and the number of elective surgeries as well as the ongoing aging of the population, as the older demographics tend to be much more frequent consumers of medical transportation services. We believe the market will also grow if hospitals and other healthcare facilities continue to outsource more of their transportation needs to independent providers, such as the Company, allowing these facilities to concentrate their efforts on their core competencies. 
 
 Overall Economic Conditions in the Markets in Which We Operate 
 Economic changes both nationally and locally in our markets may impact our financial performance. Unfavorable changes in demographics, healthcare coverage of Mobile Health Services and Transportation Services, interest rates, inflation rates or ambulance manufacturing; a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate; and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our Ability to Control Expenses 
 We pay close attention to the management of our working capital and operating expenses. Some of our most significant operating expenses are labor costs, medical supplies and vehicle-related costs, such as fuel, maintenance, repair and insurance. Insurance costs include premiums paid for coverage as well as reserves for estimated losses within the Company s insurance policy deductibles. We employ our proprietary technology to help drive improvements in productivity per transport and per shift. We regularly analyze our workforce productivity to help achieve the optimum, cost-efficient labor mix for our locations. This involves managing the mix of company-employed labor and subcontracted labor as well as full-time and part-time employees. 
 
 Inflation 
 The inflation rate in the United States, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has moderated in 2024, after trending up since early 2021. This data is reported monthly, showing year-over-year changes in prices across a basket of goods and services. Through the first nine months of 2024, the inflation rate has been 3.1 , lower than the 4.1 rate in 2023, 8.0 in 2022 and 4.7 in 2021. As the inflation rate has moderated and there have been emerging signs of a pending economic 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 slowdown, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut of 0.50 , lowering its benchmark rate to the current level of 4.75 -5.00 , after implementing four interest rate hikes in 2023. The inflation rate has had an impact on the Company s expenses in several areas, including wages, fuel and medical and other supplies. This has had the impact of compressing gross profit margins, as the Company is generally unable to pass these higher costs on to its customers, particularly in the short term. Looking to the remainder of 2024, we anticipate that the inflation rate will continue to be moderate, with additional interest rate cuts a possibility before the end of the year. If inflation is above the levels that the Company anticipates, gross margins could be below plan and our business, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
 
 Trip Volumes and Average Trip Price 
 A trip is defined as an instance where the Company completes the transportation of a patient to a specific destination, for which we are able to charge a fee. This metric does not include instances where a trip is ordered and subsequently either canceled (by the customer) or declined (by the Company). As trip volume represents the most basic unit of transportation service provided by the Company, the Company believes it is a good measure of the level of demand for the Company s Transportation Services and is used by management to monitor and manage the scale of the business. 
 The average trip price is calculated by dividing the aggregate revenue from the total number of trips by the total number of trips and is an important indicator of the effective rate at which the Company is being compensated for its provision of Transportation Services. 
 Revenues generated from programs under which the Company is paid a fixed hourly or daily rate for the use of a fully staffed and equipped ambulance do not factor in the trip counts or average trip prices mentioned above. We expect these fixed rate, leased hour programs to continue to account for an increasing proportion of the Transportation Services segment s revenues in the future. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 Historically, we have pursued an acquisition strategy to obtain enhanced capabilities or licenses to offer Mobile Health Services or Transportation Services. Future acquisitions may also include companies that may help drive revenue, profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not complete any acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed three acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of 34.2 million. 
 
 Investing in R D and Enhancing Our Customer Experience 
 Our performance is dependent on the investments we make in research and development R D ), including our ability to attract and retain highly skilled R D personnel. We intend to develop and introduce innovative new software services, integrations with third-party products and services, mobile applications and other new offerings. If we fail to innovate and enhance our brand and our products, our market position and revenue may be adversely affected. 
 
 Regulatory Environment 
 The Company is subject to federal, state and local regulations, including healthcare and emergency medical services laws and regulations and tax laws and regulations. The Company s current business plan assumes no material change in these laws and regulations. In the event that any such change occurs, compliance with new laws and regulations may significantly affect the Company s operations and cost of doing business. 
 
 Government Contracts 
 In recent years, the Company s government contract work has represented a substantial portion of its overall revenue, and maintaining and continuing to grow this revenues stream is an important part of the Company s growth strategy. However, government contract work is subject to risks and uncertainties. For example, starting in the second quarter of 2023, the Company began providing services to the recent migrant population in New York City and in upstate New York. Some of these services were provided pursuant to a contract with an ending date during the second quarter of 2024. A portion of that contract has been extended through December 31, 2024, while other services began to wind down in May 2024. While the exact timing of the wind-down of the remaining services is still subject to change, the wind-down of sites in both New York City and in upstate New York is well underway and the Company expects that the revenues from these migrant- 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 related projects will be significantly lower in the final three months of 2024 than they were in any of the first three quarters of the year. 
 
 In addition, government contract work subjects the Company to government audits, investigations and proceedings, which could lead to the Company to being barred from government work or subjected to fines if it is determined that a statute, rule, regulation, policy or contractual provision has been violated. Audits can also lead to adjustments to the amount of contract costs that the Company believes are reimbursable or to the ultimate amount the Company may be paid under the agreement. Furthermore, a loss of government contract work, if not offset by revenues from new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Our business consists of three reportable segments Mobile Health Services, Transportation Services and Corporate. All revenues and cost of revenues are contained within the Mobile Health Services and Transportation Services segments. Accordingly, revenues and cost of revenues are discussed below on a consolidated level and are also broken down between Mobile Health Services and Transportation Services. Operating expenses are discussed on a consolidated level and broken down among all three segments. The Company evaluates the performance of each of its segments based primarily on its results of operations. Accordingly, other income and expenses not included in results of operations are only included in the discussion of consolidated results of operations. 
 Revenues 
 The Company s revenues consist of services provided by its Mobile Health Services segment and its Transportation Services segment. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues consists primarily of revenues-generating wages paid to employees, fees paid to subcontractors, medical supplies, vehicle insurance costs (including insurance premiums and costs incurred under the insurance deductibles), maintenance, fuel and facility rent. We expect cost of revenues to continue to rise as we grow our business. 
 Operating Expenses 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bad debt expense, insurance expense, consultant fees and professional fees for accounting services. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our business and grow headcount and as a result of operating as a public company, including our compliance with SEC rules and regulations, audit activities, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 The Company depreciates its assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Amortization of intangibles consists of amortization of definite-lived intangible assets over their respective useful lives. 
 Legal and Regulatory Expenses 
 Legal and regulatory expenses include legal fees, consulting fees related to healthcare compliance and legal settlements. 
 Technology and Development Expenses 
 Technology and development expenses, net of capitalization, consist primarily of costs incurred in the design and development of the Company s proprietary technology, third-party software and technologies. We expect technology and development expenses to increase in future periods to support our growth, including our intent to continue investing in the optimization, accuracy and reliability of our dispatch and communication platform and driving efficiency in our operations. These expenses may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, depending primarily upon when we choose to make more significant investments, particularly when entering new business lines or customer sales channels. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 Sales, Advertising and Marketing Expenses 
 Our sales, advertising and marketing expenses consist of costs directly associated with our sales and marketing activities, which primarily include sales commissions, marketing programs, trade shows and promotional materials and general branding. We expect our sales, advertising and marketing expenses to continue to increase over time as we increase our marketing activities, grow our domestic and international operations and continue to build brand awareness. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our outstanding borrowings under our outstanding notes payable and financing obligations, including our Revolving Facility.

 Revenues 
 Consolidated 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were 138.7 million, a decrease of 47.9 million, or 25.7 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Mobile Health Services 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Mobile Health Services revenues were 90.7 million, a decrease of 48.6 million, or 34.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in revenues was due to the ongoing wind-down of migrant-related services, which had ramped up sharply in the third quarter of 2023 and peaked in the first quarter of 2024. Starting in the second quarter of 2023, the Company began providing services to the recently arrived migrant population in New York City and in upstate New York. These projects, which included both medical and non-medical services, such as shelter and security, expanded throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024. However, some of these services were provided pursuant to a contract with an ending date during the second quarter of 2024. A portion of that contract has been extended through December 31, 2024, while other services began to wind down in May 2024. While the exact timing of the wind-down of the remaining services is still subject to change, this process is well underway and the Company expects that the revenues from these migrant-related projects will be lower in the final three months of 2024 than in the final three months of 2023. As such, while we expect to launch new Mobile Health Services projects during the fourth quarter, these are expected be outweighed by a decline in revenues from migrant-related projects and we expect that overall Mobile Health Services revenues will be significantly lower in the fourth quarter of 2024 than in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Transportation Services 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Transportation Services revenues were 48.0 million, an increase of 0.8 million, or 1.7 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to an 8.5 increase in trip volumes, to 69,776 trips in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 64,321 trips for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in trip volumes was due to a combination of growth in the Company s customer base in certain core markets and increased volumes with existing customers. Our average trip price decreased to 404 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 409 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in the average trip price in the 2024 period reflected a shift in mix toward lower-priced transports when compared to the same period in 2023. However, the average trip price remains well above the levels of early 2022, reflecting a shift in mix toward higher-priced transports with existing customers, as well as the acquisition of licenses to provide higher acuity transports that earn higher prices per trip. 
 Cost of revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by 32.5 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, while revenues decreased by approximately 25.7 . Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 64.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 70.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total cost of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 42.7 million compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to an 8.2 million decrease in total compensation, a 21.1 million decline in subcontracted labor costs and a 10.7 million decline in medical and related supplies, all of which were driven by the Mobile Health Services segment, due to the ongoing wind-down of migrant-related projects during the quarter; a 2.8 million decrease in lab fees; and a 0.1 million net increase in other cost of revenues categories. 
 For the Mobile Health Services segment, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 55.5 million, down 44.1 from 99.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 61.2 from 71.2 in the prior year period, despite the decline in Mobile Health Services revenues, due to the absence of certain project ramp-up costs in the form of higher overtime rates and a greater proportion of higher-cost subcontracted labor that were recorded in the prior year period. 
 For the Transportation Services segment, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 33.3 million, up 3.4 from 32.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 69.4 from 68.3 in the prior year quarter, 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 as the increase in cost of revenues outpaced the small increase in revenues. Total compensation increased by 4 year-over-year, reflecting increased field headcount, as the Company seeks to reduce its reliance on subcontractors. Costs for subcontractors were essentially unchanged from the prior year period, but declined from the levels recorded in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting a planned reduction in the number of ambulance trips that were completed by subcontractors in instances where the Company previously did not have sufficient personnel capacity to provide the requested services. 
 Operating expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 39.8 million of operating expenses compared to 46.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 14.2 . As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased from 24.9 in the third quarter of 2023 to 28.7 in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the decrease in revenues described above. The decrease of 6.6 million of operating expenses related to a 2.7 million decline in total compensation, a 1.1 million decline in commissions, and a 4.7 million decrease in travel-related expenses, all due to the ongoing wind-down of the Mobile Health Services segment s migrant-related projects. These declines were partially offset by a net 1.9 million increase spread across a variety of other operating expense categories. The Company anticipates that operating expenses will continue to fluctuate based upon the levels of revenues that are generated. 
 For the Mobile Health Services segment, operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 13.2 million, down from 19.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 14.6 in the third quarter of 2024, from 13.4 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the drop in Mobile Health Services revenues in relation to the ongoing wind-down of migrant-related projects in New York. 
 For the Transportation Services segment, operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 14.8 million, compared to 14.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 30.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, despite the increased revenues in the current year period, reflecting increases in non-field headcount, such as dispatch and back office departments, as well as higher insurance costs, due to a larger vehicle fleet. 
 For the Corporate segment, which represents primarily shared services that are not contained within the entities included in either the Mobile Health Services or Transportation Services segments, operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 11.8 million, compared to 12.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Corporate expenses amounted to approximately 8.5 of total consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6.9 in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the decline in total consolidated revenues, which outweighed the effect of corporate expense reduction programs implemented at the end of 2023 and in early 2024. 
 Interest (expense) income, net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.5 million of interest expense, net compared to 0.3 million of interest income, net in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expenses on borrowings under the Revolving Facility outweighed interest earned on balances in the Company s interest-bearing accounts in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in fair value of contingent liability 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss for the change in fair value of contingent consideration of 44,520 compared to a gain of 159,974 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on equity method investments 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on equity method investments of 0.1 million, representing its share of the losses incurred by an entity in which the Company has a minority interest. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company also recorded a loss on equity method investments of 0.1 million. 
 Loss on disposal of fixed assets 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of 28,681, compared to a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of 9,983 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Provision for income taxes 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 4.5 million, compared to an income tax provision of 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The slightly lower tax expense in the 2024 period was due to a small decline in pretax income in the 2024 period. 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately 1.0 million, compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues 
 Consolidated 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were 495.7 million, an increase of 70.7 million, or 16.6 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Mobile Health Services 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mobile Health Services revenues were 351.3 million, an increase of 59.0 million, or 20.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 due to an expansion in services offered by the Mobile Health Services segment, particularly in the government customer sector. Specifically, starting in the second quarter of 2023, the Company began providing services to the recently arrived migrant population in New York City and in upstate New York. These projects, which included both medical and non-medical services, such as shelter and security, expanded throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024. However, some of these services were provided pursuant to a contract with an ending date during the second quarter of 2024. A portion of that contract has been extended through December 31, 2024, while other services began to wind down in May 2024, with the wind-down accelerating, as expected, during the third quarter of 2024. While the exact timing of the wind-down of the remaining services is still subject to change, the process is well underway and the Company expects that the revenues from these migrant-related projects will be significantly lower in the fourth quarter of 2024 than in any of the first three quarters of the year. As such, while we expect to launch new Mobile Health Services projects during the last quarter of the year, these are expected to be outweighed by a decline in revenues from migrant-related projects and we expect that overall Mobile Health Services revenues will be significantly lower in the fourth quarter of 2024 than in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Transportation Services 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Transportation Services revenues were 144.4 million, an increase of 11.7 million, or 8.8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a 15.1 increase in trip volumes, to 213,475 trips in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 185,404 trips for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in trip volumes was due to a combination of growth in the Company s customer base in certain core markets and increased volumes with existing customers. Our average trip price declined to 399 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 405 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in the average trip price in the 2024 period reflected a small shift in mix toward lower-priced transports when compared to the first nine months of 2023. However, the average trip price remains well above the levels of early 2022, reflecting a shift in mix toward higher-priced transports with existing customers, as well as the acquisition of licenses to provide higher acuity transports that earn higher prices per trip. 
 Cost of revenues 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by 8.9 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while revenues increased by approximately 16.6 . Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 65.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 69.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total cost of revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 26.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 12.8 million increase in subcontracted labor costs, primarily driven by projects in both segments that required more personnel than the Company was able to initially provide through its existing staff; a 6.3 million increase in medical and related supplies, also related to an increase in projects, particularly in the first six months of 2024; and a 7.2 million net increase in other cost of revenues categories, including insurance. 
 For the Mobile Health Services segment, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 223.2 million, up 9.3 from 204.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 63.5 from 69.8 in the prior year period, due to an increase in revenues and the absence of certain project ramp-up costs in the form of higher overtime rates and a greater proportion of subcontracted labor that were recorded in the prior year period. 
 For the Transportation Services segment, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 99.4 million, up 7.8 from 92.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 68.8 from 69.5 in the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of increased revenues from standby contracts (for which we are paid a daily or hourly rate) and the overall increase in revenue. 
 Operating expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 136.9 million of operating expenses compared to 125.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 9.3 . As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses decreased from 29.5 in the first nine months of 2023 to 27.6 in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting the increase in revenues described above. The increase of 11.6 million of operating expenses related primarily to a 0.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization due to an increase in assets to support revenue growth, capitalized software amortization and assets that were added as part of acquisitions that the Company completed during 2023; a 0.6

Table of Contents 

 million increase in IT infrastructure, driven by the Company s business and headcount expansion and acquisitions; a 1.9 million increase in professional fees, including higher audit fees resulting from the growth of the business; a 3.5 million increase in bad debt expense, reflecting the growth of the business and related increase in accounts receivable; and a net 4.7 million increase spread across a variety of other operating expense categories. The Company anticipates that operating expenses will continue to fluctuate based upon the levels of revenues that are generated. 
 For the Mobile Health Services segment, operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 47.9 million, up from 36.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.6 in the first nine months of 2024, from 12.3 in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting significant expenditures that were made in the second half of 2023 and the early part of 2024 in the expansion of services, particular in relation to the migrant-related projects in New York; as well as the continued buildout of the Mobile Health Services management infrastructure. 
 For the Transportation Services segment, operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 46.1 million, compared to 39.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 31.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 29.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, despite the increased revenues in the current year period, reflecting increases in non-field headcount, such as dispatch and back office departments, as well as higher insurance costs, due to a larger vehicle fleet during 2024 to date. 
 For the Corporate segment, which represents primarily shared services that are not contained within the entities included in either the Mobile Health Services or Transportation Services segments, operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 42.9 million, compared to 49.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Corporate expenses amounted to approximately 8.7 of total consolidated revenues in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 11.7 in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting the increase in total consolidated revenues as well as some corporate expense reduction programs implemented at the end of 2023 and in early 2024. 
 Interest (expense) income, net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 1.4 million of interest expense, net compared to 1.7 million of interest income, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expenses on borrowings under the Revolving Facility outweighed interest earned on balances in the Company s interest-bearing accounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while average cash balances in these accounts were also lower when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in fair value of contingent liability 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss for the change in fair value of contingent consideration of 0.4 million compared to a 0.2 million gain related to a change in fair value recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on equity method investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on equity method investments of 0.2 million, representing its share of the losses incurred by an entity in which the Company has a minority interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss on equity method investments of 0.3 million. 
 Gain (loss) on disposal of fixed assets 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on the disposal of fixed assets of 36,717 compared to a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of 163,452 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other income (expense) 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded other income of 0.1 million, compared to other expense of 0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 13.3 million, compared to an income tax provision of 2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased tax 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 expense in the 2024 period was due to the recording of significantly higher pretax income in the 2024 period, as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately 2.2 million, compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Between the inception of the Company s wholly owned subsidiary Ambulnz and the Business Combination, Ambulnz completed three equity financing transactions as its principal source of liquidity. In November 2021, upon the completion of the Business Combination and the PIPE Financing, the Company received proceeds of approximately 158.1 million, net of transaction expenses. Generally, the Company has utilized proceeds from the equity financing transactions and the Business Combination to finance operations, invest in assets, make acquisitions and fund accounts receivable. The Company has also funded these activities through operating cash flows. Despite the fact that the Company generated net income and operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating cash flows are not always sufficient to meet immediate obligations arising from current operations. For example, as the business has grown, the Company s expenditures for human capital and supplies have expanded accordingly, and the timing of the payments for payroll and to associated vendors, compared to the timing of receipts of cash from customers, frequently results in the need to use existing cash balances to fund working capital needs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a greater proportion of the Company s overall revenues were generated through services provided to municipal customers with long payment cycles, and expenditures made by the Company to allow for the provision of these services were substantial, near-term operating cash flows were not always sufficient to meet these demands for working capital, leading to fluctuations in the Company s cash balances. As these invoices are collected, the Company expects cash flows to be sufficient for near term working capital needs. 
 The Company s future working capital needs depend on many factors, including the overall growth of the Company and the various payment terms that are negotiated with customers and vendors. The Company s future capital requirements depend on many factors, including potential acquisitions, the Company s level of investment in technology and ongoing technology development, and rate of growth in existing markets and into new markets. Capital requirements might also be affected by factors outside of the Company s control, such as interest rates, rising inflation and other monetary and fiscal policy changes to the manner in which the Company currently operates. If the Company s growth rate is higher than is currently anticipated, resulting in greater-than-anticipated capital requirements, the Company might need to, or choose to, raise additional capital through debt or equity financings. This last factor has been evident at different times during the second half of 2023 and during the first quarter of 2024, leading to a draw down in the Company s credit line during the fourth quarter of 2023 and during the first quarter of 2024, as described below. 
 
 On November 1, 2022, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for the Revolving Facility in the initial aggregate principal amount of 90.0 million. The Revolving Facility includes the ability for the Company to request an increase to the commitment by an additional amount of up to 50.0 million, though no lender (nor the lenders collectively) is obligated to increase its respective commitments. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) at the Company s option, (x) the base rate or (y) the adjusted term SOFR rate, plus (ii) the applicable margin. The applicable margins are based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio, adjusted on a quarterly basis. The initial applicable margins were 1.25 for an adjusted term SOFR loan and 0.25 for a base rate loan and are updated based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio. The Revolving Facility matures on November 1, 2027 and is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company s present and future personal assets and intangible assets. The Revolving Facility is subject to certain financial covenants, such as a net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. On October 19, 2023, the Company drew down 25.0 million under the Revolving Facility. On February 8, 2024, the Company drew down an additional 15.0 million. On February 27, 2024, the Company repaid all amounts then outstanding under the Revolving Facility. However, in March 2024, the Company once again drew down under the Revolving Facility, and there was a total of 30.0 million outstanding as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Considering the foregoing, the Company anticipates that its existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, future expected cash flows generated from its operations and amounts available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. Looking beyond the next twelve months, the Company 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 anticipates that expected future cash flows, amounts available under the Revolving Facility and proceeds from potential additional financings will be sufficient to satisfy any operating and potential investing requirements. 
 Capital Resources 
 Working capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 September 30 December 31 Change Change in Millions 2024 2023 Working capital Current assets 328.3 338.9 (10.6) (3.1) Current liabilities 150.2 170.1 (19.9) (11.7) Total working capital 178.1 168.8 9.3 5.5 
 As of September 30, 2024, available cash totaled 89.5 million, which represented an increase of 30.2 million compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the Company collected some of its larger invoices. As of September 30, 2024, working capital amounted to 178.1 million, which represented an increase of 9.3 million compared to December 31, 2023, as an increase in cash and a decline in accrued liabilities outweighed a decline in accounts receivable. Current assets declined by 10.6 million, due to a drop in prepaid expenses. However, this was outweighed by the decline in current liabilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to lower accrued liabilities, reflecting lower invoices and accrued liabilities in the current period for certain expenses, such as subcontracted labor, and as the Company paid down a significant amount of its accrued liabilities during the year-to-date period. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Change in Millions 2024 2023 Cash flow summary Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 57.4 (58.3) 115.7 198.5 Net cash used in investing activities (5.3) (26.9) 21.6 80.3 Net cash used in financing activities (16.3) (11.9) (4.4) (37.0) Effect of exchange rate changes 0.5 0.2 0.3 150.0 Net increase (decrease) in cash 36.3 (96.9) 133.2 137.5 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided 57.4 million of cash, aided by net income of 21.0 million. Non-cash charges amounted to 21.5 million and included 7.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment and right-of-use assets, 4.9 million from amortization of intangible assets, 9.7 million of stock compensation expense, bad debt expense of 3.8 million, a loss of 0.2 million from an investment that is accounted for under the equity method and a change in the fair value of contingent consideration of 0.4 million. These were partially offset by 5.2 million in deferred taxes. Changes in assets and liabilities resulted in approximately 14.9 million in positive operating cash flow, as a 19.8 million decline in accounts receivable, reflecting collections of invoices from large municipal customers, a 12.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a 15.3 million increase in accounts payable outweighed a 31.5 million decline in accrued liabilities and a 1.0 million increase in other assets. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 58.3 million of cash, despite net income of 2.1 million.

 expense and a non-cash gain of 0.2 million resulting from a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration. Changes in assets and liabilities resulted in approximately 88.4 million in negative operating cash flow, as a 103.5 million increase in accounts receivable, reflecting the growth of the business and primarily driven by an increased amount of business with municipalities, which tend to have longer payment cycles, a 12.6 million decrease in accounts payable, and a 0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets were partially offset by a 27.3 million increase in accrued liabilities and a 0.7 million decline in other assets. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used 5.3 million of cash and consisted of the acquisition of property and equipment totaling approximately 2.9 million, the acquisition of intangibles in the amount of 2.2 million and an equity method investment in the amount of 0.3 million, partially offset by 0.1 million in cash proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.

 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities used 16.3 million of cash, as 45.0 million in proceeds from the Revolving Facility were mostly offset by 40.0 million in repayments of the Revolving Facility.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financing activities used 11.9 million of cash, primarily due to a 8.4 million decrease in amounts due to seller, relating to payments made for acquisitions that were completed in the second half of 2022 and second quarter of 2023; 2.3 million in payments on obligations under the terms of finance leases; 2.2 million in payments for taxes related to shares withheld for employee taxes; and 0.5 million in repayments of notes payable. These amounts were partially offset by 1.5 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Noncontrolling interests in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements represent the portion of consolidated joint ventures and VIEs in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. 
 The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, the Company was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of Ambulnz stock for the net assets of the Company, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of the Company are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of Ambulnz. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share available for common stockholders prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio (645.1452 to 1) established in the Business Combination. Further, Ambulnz was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination, and as such, the Business Combination is considered a business combination under ASC 805 and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 The Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of DocGo Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 

 The Company holds variable interests in legal entities that contract with physicians and other health professionals that provide services on behalf of the Company. These entities are considered VIEs since they do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support. An enterprise having a controlling financial interest in a VIE must consolidate the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary, meaning it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the VIE s economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). The Company has the power and rights to control all activities of its VIEs and funds and absorbs all losses of its VIEs. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of its VIEs and therefore appropriately consolidates its VIEs. 
 Net income (loss) for the Company s VIEs was (67,785) and (103,378) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (425,668) and 16,839 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total assets amounted to 11,844,062 and 4,364,274 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total liabilities were 12,717,312 and 4,811,857 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s VIEs total stockholders deficit was 873,250 and 447,583 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Business Combination 
 The Company accounts for its business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805-10, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including noncontrolling interests, are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. 
 Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. If the business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date and any changes in fair value after the acquisition date are accounted for as measurement-period adjustments. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as earn-outs, are recognized as follows: 1) if the contingent consideration is classified as equity, the contingent consideration is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity, or 2) if the contingent consideration is classified as a liability, the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. For transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. The Company capitalizes acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expenses acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations. 
 The estimated fair value of net assets to be acquired, including the allocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities, is determined using established valuation techniques. Management uses assumptions on the basis of historical knowledge of the business and projected financial information of the target. These assumptions may vary based on future events, perceptions of different market participants and other factors outside the control of management, and such variations may be significant to estimated values. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on December 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not to be impaired. These events include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, as indicated by our publicly quoted share price, below our net book value. 
 On February 3, 2023, Health commenced an ABC pursuant to California law. An ABC is a liquidation process governed by state law (California law in this instance) that is an alternative to a bankruptcy case under federal law. Prior to commencing the ABC, Health ceased business operations and all of its employees were terminated and treated in accordance with California law. In the ABC, all of Health s assets were transferred to the Assignee, who acts as a fiduciary for creditors and in a capacity equivalent to that of a bankruptcy trustee. The Assignee is responsible for liquidating the assets. Similar to a bankruptcy case, there was a claims process. Creditors of Health received notice of the ABC and a proof of claim form and were required to submit a proof of claim in order to participate in distribution of net liquidation proceeds by the Assignee.

 Based on such filing for Health, the Company impaired the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit as of December 31, 2022 by approximately 5.1 million. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 606. 
 To determine revenue recognition for contractual arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify each contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the relevant performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will be able to collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services the Company provides to the customer. 
 The Company generates revenues from the provision of (1) Mobile Health Services and (2) Transportation Services. For both Mobile Health Services and Transportation Services, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company as the performance obligations are fulfilled. Therefore, the Company satisfies performance obligations immediately. The Company has utilized the right to invoice expedient, which allows an entity to recognize revenue in the amount of consideration to which the entity has the right to invoice when the amount that the Company has the right to invoice corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer. 
 The transaction price associated with the Company s contracts with customers is generally determined based on fixed and determinable amounts of consideration as specified in a contract, which includes a fixed base rate and fixed mileage rate. For transportation services arrangements with billings to third party payors and healthcare facilities, this may also include variable consideration in instances where it is considered probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. For these services, revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances for claims subject to contracts with responsible paying entities. The Company estimates contractual allowance at the time of billing based on contractual terms, historical collections or other arrangements. The Company also estimates the amount unbilled at month end and recognizes such amounts as revenue, based on available data and customer history. The Company utilizes the expected value method when estimating its variable consideration. The assumptions utilized in estimating variable consideration include the Company s previous experience with similar contracts and history of collection rates on prior trips that have been performed. The Company reevaluates its variable consideration at each reporting period. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or its tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, including those relating to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk relating to our cash equivalents and borrowings under our Revolving Facility, which bear interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) at our option, (x) the base rate or (y) the adjusted term SOFR rate, plus (ii) the 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 applicable margin. The applicable margins are based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio, adjusted on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2023, there was a 25,000,000 outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility. The Company drew down an additional 15,000,000 on February 8, 2024 under the Revolving Facility. On February 27, 2024, the Company paid the 40,000,000 Revolving Facility balance. On March 4, 2024, the Company drew down 15,000,000 and made an additional 15,000,000 draw on March 18, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Facility was 30,000,000 and the unused portion of the Revolving Facility was 60,000,000. While the applicable interest rate is set for a specific term when amounts are drawn down under the terms of the Revolving Facility, any subsequent draws on the Revolving Facility may be subject to a higher or lower interest rate, depending upon, among other things, the then-prevailing SOFR rate. We have not utilized interest rate hedging or other strategies in an attempt to mitigate our interest rate risk. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have had a neutral net impact on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as changes in amounts paid for interest expense would have offset changes in interest income earned on cash balances. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We operate our business primarily within the U.S. and currently execute a majority of our transactions in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to limited foreign exchange risk as a result of our U.K. operations. The foreign exchange gain (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 934,774 and (582,471), respectively, and 828,613 and 66,965 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have not utilized hedging strategies with respect to such foreign exchange exposure. This limited foreign currency translation risk is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A hypothetical 10 change in the applicable foreign exchange rate would have resulted in a change in total revenues of approximately 0.9 and 0.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a change in total assets of approximately 0.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Concentrations of Risk and Significant Clients 
 Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Although we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions in the United States and in foreign countries, our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We do not believe we are exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the funds are held. 
 With respect to accounts receivable, the Company had one customer that accounted for approximately 41 of revenues and 34 of net accounts receivable and another customer that accounted for 21 of revenues and 44 of net accounts receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had one customer that accounted for approximately 36 of revenues and 34 of net accounts receivable and another customer that accounted for 31 of revenues and 44 of net accounts receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had one customer that accounted for approximately 33 of revenues and 36 of net accounts receivable and another customer that accounted for 32 of revenues and 28 of net accounts receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2023. One customer accounted for approximately 37 of revenues and 28 of net accounts receivable and another customer accounted for approximately 17 of revenues and 36 of net accounts receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We perform ongoing evaluations of customers financial condition, creditworthiness and payment performance. Based on these evaluations, we consider whether or not the accounts receivable exposure to any specific customer is within an acceptable range for that customer. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on our management s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 On March 31, 2023, Holdings acquired 51 of the outstanding shares of common stock of CRMS, a provider of cardiac implantable electronic device remote monitoring and virtual care management services. The closing consideration of 10,000,000 consisted of 9,000,000 in cash and 1,000,000 worth of shares of Common Stock issued in a private placement transaction. The Company also agreed to pay additional consideration following the initial closing, including the True-up Payment to be paid in 2024 based on the attainment of full-year 2023 EBITDA targets. 
 
 On May 29, 2024, the Company made a portion of the True-up Payment in the amount of 1,000,000 in cash. On July 19, 2024, the Company also issued 1,814,345 in Common Stock, or 578,350 shares, in a private placement, constituting the remainder of the True-up Payment. 
 
 The foregoing transaction did not involve any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued and sold the shares of Common Stock in a private placement to accredited investors, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company relied on this exemption from registration based in part as each accredited investor was aware of the terms of the transaction, the securities issued contained restrictive legends regarding resale and transfer, and the transaction was not publicly solicited or advertised. 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 On January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Prior Repurchase Program, pursuant to which the Company could purchase up to 36,000,000 in shares of Common Stock during a six-month period that ended July 30, 2024. The Prior Repurchase Program did not oblige the Company to repurchase a specific number of shares. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, following the expiration of the Prior Repurchase Program on July 30, 2024, the Board effectively extended the Prior Repurchase Program by authorizing the New Repurchase Program, pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 26,000,000 in shares of Common Stock, which was the approximate amount remaining under the Prior Repurchase Program at its expiration. The New Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2024 and may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
 
 Under the terms of the New Repurchase Program, the Company may purchase shares of Common Stock on a discretionary basis from time to time through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions or through other means, including by entering into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or accelerated share repurchase programs, in each case, during an open window and when the Company does not possess material non-public information.

Table of Contents 

The timing, manner, price and amount of shares repurchased under the New Repurchase Program will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements and other general business considerations. The New Repurchase Program does not oblige the Company to repurchase a specific number of shares. 
 
 Repurchases under the New Repurchase Program may be funded from the Company s existing cash and cash equivalents, future cash flow or proceeds of borrowings or debt offerings . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 24.7 million remained available for share repurchases pursuant to the New Repurchase Program.
