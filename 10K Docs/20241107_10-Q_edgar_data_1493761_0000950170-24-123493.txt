million shares of Company common stock and approximately million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments for working capital, closing cash, closing debt and closing third party expenses. On a fully-diluted basis, issued stock represented approximately of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of the closing date. The fair value of the million common shares issued as part of the consideration was determined on the basis of the closing market price of the Company s common shares on the acquisition date, or per share. As a result, the total preliminary purchase consideration was million, partially funded by borrowing on the new term loan facility (see Note 8). Additionally, the Company recognized million of acquisition-related costs that were expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The fair values assigned to PDP s assets and liabilities are provisional and were determined based on preliminary estimates and assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to further refinement and may require significant adjustments to arrive at the final purchase price allocation. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed as soon as the necessary information is available, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized measurement period adjustments primarily to establish preliminary values for the opening balance sheet of the net assets acquired including intangibles assets, which also resulted in a reduction in goodwill from the previously reported preliminary amount. The goodwill from the acquisition, which is fully deductible for tax purposes, consists largely of synergies and economies of scale expected from adding the operations of PDP's and the Company s existing business and supply channels. The preliminary fair value of PDP s identifiable intangible assets was determined primarily using the income approach, which requires a forecast of all expected future cash flows either through the use of the multi-period excess earnings method or the relief-from-royalty method. Such forecasts are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, and as such, are classified as

As of September 30, 2024, interest rates for outstanding borrowings were for base rate loans and for Term SOFR loans. The Company is subject to quarterly financial covenant testing if certain availability thresholds are not met or certain other events occur (as set forth in the Credit Facility). At such times, the Credit Facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to take certain actions, including the Company s ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates, and encumber and dispose of assets.

Effective income tax rate 

() 

() 

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by the change in U.S. valuation allowance related to the acquisition of PDP, foreign taxes, Federal and state current tax and interest on uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes only those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and establishes tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had uncertain tax positions of million , inclusive of million of interest and penalties. As required by the authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes, the Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis at each reporting date. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred taxes will not be realized. The Company considers all positive and negative evidence in determining if, based on the weight of such evidence, a valuation allowance is required. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. Due to the significant 2022 pre-tax loss, coupled with cumulative book losses projected in early future years, the Company recorded a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022. While the Company continues to maintain this valuation allowance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , it did release million of valuation allowance for PDP acquired net deferred tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income taxes domestically and in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company files U.S., state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with various statutes of limitations. The federal tax years open under the statute of limitations are 2020 through 2023, and the state tax years open under the statute of limitations are 2019 through 2023.

Stock options are time-based and the majority are exercisable within years of the date of grant, but only to the extent they have vested. The options generally vest as specified in the option agreements subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. In the event participants in the plan cease to be employed or engaged by the Company, all vested options would be forfeited if they are not exercised within days. Forfeitures on option grants are estimated at for non-executives and for executives based on evaluation of historical and expected future turnover. Stock-based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures, such that expense was recorded only for those stock-based awards expected to vest. The Company reviews this assumption periodically and will adjust it if it is not representative of future forfeiture data and trends within employee types (executive vs. non-executive).

Incremental shares from stock options and restricted stock awards are computed using the treasury stock method. The weighted average shares listed below were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented or were otherwise excluded under the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method calculates dilution assuming the exercise of all in-the-money options and vesting of restricted stock, reduced by the repurchase of shares with the proceeds from the assumed exercises and unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding awards.

ownership interest and existing shareholders would maintain an approximately ownership interest in the combined company (the Merger ). Following the announcement, several shareholders filed class action lawsuits in California and Nevada seeking to enjoin the Merger. The plaintiffs in each case alleged that members of the Company s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to the shareholders by agreeing to a merger that allegedly undervalued the Company. VTBH and the Company were named as defendants in these lawsuits under the theory that they had aided and abetted the Company s Board of Directors in allegedly violating their fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs in both cases sought a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin closing of the Merger, which, by agreement, was heard by the Nevada court with the California plaintiffs invited to participate. On December 26, 2013, the court in the Nevada case denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction. Following the closing of the Merger, the Nevada plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which made essentially the same allegations and sought monetary damages as well as an order rescinding the Merger. The California plaintiffs dismissed their action without prejudice, and sought to intervene in the Nevada action, which was granted. Subsequent to the intervention, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, which made essentially the same allegations as prior complaints and sought monetary damages. On June 20, 2014, VTBH and the Company moved to dismiss the action, but that motion was denied on August 28, 2014. On September 14, 2017, a unanimous en banc panel of the Nevada Supreme Court granted defendants petition for writ of mandamus and ordered the trial court to dismiss the complaint but provided a limited basis upon which plaintiffs could seek to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs amended their complaint on December 1, 2017 to assert the same claims in a derivative capacity on behalf of the Company, as well as in a direct capacity, against VTBH, Stripes Group, LLC, SG VTB Holdings, LLC, and the former members of the Company s Board of Directors. All defendants moved to dismiss this amended complaint on January 2, 2018, and those motions were denied on March 13, 2018. Defendants petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court to reverse this ruling on April 18, 2018. On June 15, 2018, the Nevada Supreme Court denied defendants writ petition without prejudice. The district court subsequently entered a pretrial schedule and set trial for November 2019. On January 18, 2019, the district court certified a class of shareholders of the Company as of January 15, 2014. On October 11, 2019, the parties notified the district court that they had reached a settlement that would resolve the pending action if ultimately approved by the Court. On January 13, 2020, the district court preliminarily approved the settlement between the plaintiffs and all defendants. A final hearing was held on May 18, 2020, wherein the Court approved the settlement and entered final judgment. On May 22, 2020, PAMTP LLC, which purports to hold the claims of shareholders who opted out of the class settlement described above, brought suit against the Company, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer, Juergen Stark, Stripes Group, LLC, SG VTB Holdings, LLC, Kenneth Fox, and former members of the Company s Board of Directors in Nevada state court. This opt-out action asserts the same direct claims that were asserted by the class of shareholders described above. The defendants filed two motions to dismiss this complaint, which were heard on August 10, 2020. The Court denied those motions by order of August 20, 2020. The case was tried in August 2021 and all remaining defendants, including the Company, prevailed on all counts with final judgment entered in their favor on September 3, 2021. Plaintiff appealed that judgment. On June 6, 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the judgment in Defendants favor and subsequently denied Plaintiff s petition for rehearing on July 22, 2024. Employment Litigation: On April 20, 2017, a former employee filed an action in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego, State of California. The complaint alleges claims including wrongful termination, retaliation and various other provisions of the California Labor Code. The complaint seeks unspecified economic and non-economic losses, as well as allegedly unpaid wages, unreimbursed business expenses statutory penalties, interest, punitive damages and attorneys fees. The Company filed a cross-complaint against the former employee on May 25, 2017 for certain activities related to his employment with the Company. The matter was tried between September 24, 2021 and October 7, 2021. On October 8, 2021 a jury rendered a unanimous verdict in favor of the Company on the employment claims. The Court granted a directed verdict to the Company on its cross-complaint against the former employee. Judgment was entered in favor of the Company on October 27, 2021. On December 20, 2021, the former employee filed a notice of appeal of the judgment. On November 14, 2023, the court of appeal issued its opinion affirming the judgment in favor of the Company. On the Company s cross-complaint, the court of appeal directed the Company to elect either punitive or statutory treble damages, but otherwise affirmed. On March 8, 2024, the Superior Court entered an amended judgment in favor of the Company and awarding the Company monetary damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees and costs. Insolvency Dispute in Germany: On February 15, 2024, TBC Holding Company LLC TBCH ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Turtle Beach Corporation, was served with a lawsuit that was brought to the German Higher Regional Court in Stade by the insolvency administrator of KJE Europe GmbH, a company registered and existing under the laws of Germany. In his complaint, the insolvency administrator claims that TBCH is liable to reimburse any payments received by the TBCH under a certain settlement agreement with KJE Europe GmbH dated June 30, 2020. TBCH filed its statement of defense to the complaint on April 30, 2024 and the insolvency administrator filed his response in a brief on June 11, 2024. A procedural hearing of the case has been scheduled for December 13, 2024. TBCH does not believe the claims have merit and intends to defend itself in this proceeding. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in the foregoing unresolved matters. However, litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters. The Company has not recorded any accrual at September 30, 2024 for contingent losses associated with these matters based on its belief that losses, while possible, are not probable. Further,

The Turtle Beach brand is a market share leader in console gaming headsets with a vast portfolio of headsets designed to be compatible with the latest Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles, as well as for personal computers PCs and mobile/tablet devices. Turtle Beach Corporation s PC product portfolio includes headsets, gaming keyboards, mice and other gaming accessories focused on the PC gaming platform. Recently, Turtle Beach expanded its brand beyond gaming headsets and began making game controllers, gaming flight simulation and racing simulation accessories. Acquired in March 2024, PDP is a gaming accessories leader that designs and distributes video game accessories, including controllers, headsets, power supplies, cases, and other accessories. 
 Business Trends 
 
 Turtle Beach operates in an overall 200 billion global games and accessories market. The global gaming audience now exceeds global cinema and music markets with over three billion active gamers worldwide. Gaming peripherals, such as headsets, keyboards, mice, microphones, controllers, and simulation controls are estimated to be an 11.0 billion business globally. 
 The console and PC gaming accessory markets are driven by major game launches and long-running franchises that encourage players to continually buy equipment and accessories. On Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and PC, flagship games like Call of Duty, Destiny, Star Wars: Battlefront, Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto, and battle royale games like Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Apex Legends, and PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds, are examples of major franchises that prominently feature online multiplayer modes that encourage communication and drive increased demand for gaming headsets. Many of these established franchises launch new titles annually, leading into the holidays and as a result can cause an additional boost to the normally strong holiday sales for gaming accessories. 
 Many gamers play online where a gaming headset, which includes a microphone, is required because it allows players to communicate with each other in real-time, provides a more immersive experience, and delivers a competitive advantage. 
 Console Headset Market 
 Turtle Beach is the leading console gaming headset manufacturer in the U.S. and other major console markets. Turtle Beach has achieved these global market shares by delivering high-quality products that often include first-to-market innovations, robust features, superior sound, unmatched comfort, and top customer support all key factors that consumers seek when shopping for a gaming headset. 
 The global market for console gaming headsets, in which Turtle Beach has been the market leader for the past 14 years, is estimated to be approximately 1.5 billion. PlayStation and Xbox consoles continue to be the dominant gaming platforms in North America and Europe for games that drive headset usage. Consistent with a historical pattern of major new console launches every 7-8 years, Microsoft and Sony launched their latest consoles, Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, ahead of the 2020 holiday season. 
 21 

Nintendo has sold over 140 million units of its highly popular Nintendo Switch since the platform's release in early 2017. Nintendo continues adding and expanding its library of games, including an increased number of multiplayer chat-enabled games. Nintendo also sells the Nintendo Switch Lite, a follow-on product that offers gamers the hand-held only version of their popular gaming console. PC Accessories Market 
 
 The market for PC gaming headsets, mice, and keyboards is estimated to be approximately 3.3 billion. PC gaming continues to be a main gaming platform in the U.S. and internationally, similarly driven by popular AAA game launches, by popular PC-specific esports leagues, teams, and players, content creators, and influencers, and with the introduction of cross-platform play where PC gamers can play online against other gamers playing the same game on an Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo Switch. While most games are available on multiple platforms, gaming on PC offers advantages including improved graphics, increased speed and precision of mouse/keyboard controls, and the ability for deeper customization. Gaming mice and keyboards are engineered to provide gamers with high-end performance and a superior gaming experience through features such as fast key and button response times, improved materials and build quality, comfortable ergonomic designs, programmable keys and buttons, and software suites to customize and control devices and settings. 
 PC gaming mice come in a variety of different ergonomic shapes and sizes, are available in both wired and wireless models, offer different sensor options (optical or laser) and responsiveness, and often feature integrated RGB LED lighting and software to unify the lighting with other devices for a visually consistent PC gaming appearance. Similarly, PC gaming keyboards often deliver a competitive advantage by offering options for ultra-responsive mechanical and optical key switches that feel and sound different, as well as offer customizable lighting. 
 Gamepad/Controllers Market 
 The market for gamepad controllers is estimated to be approximately 0.7 billion, and shares the same retail footprint and consumer base that Turtle Beach gaming headsets compete in. Controllers now come in various ergonomic shapes, sizes, and colors. Gamers can even further customize their controllers with unique thumbsticks and better grips/textures, weights, and more. Game controllers also range in price from ~ 40 to more than 300 for ultra premium options, with premium controllers featuring improved materials, cooling, swappable parts and more. Turtle Beach entered the controllers market in 2021 with the introduction of its wired Recon Controller for Xbox and PC. Turtle Beach then launched the lower-cost wired REACT-R Controller in 2022, as well as introduced the mobile focused Recon Cloud and Atom controllers. In 2023, Turtle Beach launched its first wireless controller for Xbox and PC, the premium Stealth Ultra controller. Turtle Beach s controllers not only provide the same responsive, quality controls as first party controllers, but also offer Turtle Beach s signature gaming audio experience when gamers connect a wired headset to the controller. 
 Gaming Simulation Accessories Market 
 The market for gaming simulation accessories is estimated to be approximately 1.2 billion. Flight and racing simulation gaming are more popular on higher-end PCs able to deliver the most realistic visuals. However, jumps in visual quality made possible in the latest consoles/games have made flight simulation gaming on Xbox more accessible. In 2020, Microsoft redefined the graphics flight sim gamers can expect while playing with the launch of the latest generation of its Flight Sim games and, in subsequent years, Microsoft expanded the game to Xbox Series X|S1, Xbox One, lower-end gaming PCs, and mobile via Xbox Cloud. 
 Long-running popular flight sim games like Flight Simulator 2024, X-Plane, and others allow pilots to learn to fly and pilot various aircraft through picture-perfect skies and scenery, with typical flight sim accessories including yokes and pedals, combat flightsticks, and HOTAS (Hands-On Throttle And Stick) controllers. The flight sim market is niche, but is supported by a dedicated, older fanbase willing to spend more on accessories to create the ultimate flight simulation setups, with a variety of expert pilots and creators showcasing their latest content on YouTube and other mediums. Turtle Beach launched the original VelocityOne Flight universal control system in 2021, followed by the VelocityOne Rudder and VelocityOne Stand in 2022, the VelocityOne Flightstick in 2023, and the VelocityOne Flightdeck HOTAS controller in 2024. 
 Racing simulation gaming follows a similar trajectory as flight simulation gaming. The audience of racing sim gamers is also niche, dedicated, slightly older and willing to spend more on creating high-end racing simulation setups predominantly on PC, but also on gaming consoles. There are also a variety of long-running, successful racing game franchises including Forza, Assetto Corsa, and more that allow drivers to get behind the wheel and experience the rush of racing. Typical racing simulation accessories include wheel and pedal setups, swappable steering wheels, shifters, handbrakes and more, ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars for the most involved simulators. Racing simulation fans also regularly create content and share with the community. Turtle Beach introduced its first VelocityOne Race racing simulation wheel and pedals setup in 2024, with additional racing sim accessory launches planned for the future.

Selling and Marketing 
 Selling and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 13.5 million and 36.3 million, respectively, compared to 10.6 million and 30.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, due to incremental intangible assets amortization and operating expenses related to the PDP acquisition, and integration related severance costs. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.3 million and 12.8 million, respectively, compared to 4.4 million and 12.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which reflects incremental expense related to the PDP acquisition and certain integration related severance partially offset by lower headcount and costs associated with our product portfolio rationalization initiatives. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 6.4 million compared to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflective of incremental costs from PDP operations and certain professional service costs. 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 19.5 million compared to 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding 2.5 million of activism related costs, but inclusive of incremental costs from PDP operations, expenses decreased 3.4 million primarily due to lower severance and non-cash stock-based compensation. 
 Acquisition-related cost 
 Acquisition-related costs included costs incurred in connection with acquisitions including professional fees such as legal and accounting along with other certain integration related costs of the acquisition. 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.5) million at an effective tax rate of 58.2 compared to income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.4 million at an effective tax rate of (1.5 ). The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted the by the reversal of a portion of the Company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance. 
 Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Management routinely reviews key performance indicators, including revenue, operating income and margins, and earnings per share, among others. In addition, we believe certain other measures provide useful information to management and investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) they are measures used by our Board of Directors and management team to evaluate our operating performance; (ii) they are measures used by our management team to make day-to-day operating decisions; (iii) the adjustments made are often viewed as either non-recurring or not reflective of ongoing financial performance and/or have no cash impact on operations; and (iv) the measures are used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common operating performance measure to compare results across companies in our industry by adjusting for potential differences caused by variations in capital structures 
 24 

(affecting relative interest expense), and the age and book value of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense). These other metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and given the limitations of these metrics as analytical tools, should not be considered a substitute for gross profit, gross margins, net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data as determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation (non-cash) and certain non-recurring special items that we believe are not representative of core operations, is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not core to our operations. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and, given the limitations of these metrics as analytical tools, should not be considered a substitute for gross profit, gross margins, net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data as determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (and a reconciliation to Net income (loss), the nearest GAAP financial measure) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, are as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and availability of capital under our revolving credit facility. We have funded operations and acquisitions in recent periods with operating cash flows and proceeds from debt and equity financings.

Operating activities 
 Cash used for operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.6 million, a decrease of 16.5 million as compared to 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of certain acquisition-related business costs. 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used for investing activities was 80.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily related to the acquisition of the Performance Designed Products business, compared to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to certain capital investments. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 82.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used for financing activities of 5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 58.6 million net borrowings, the 50 million term loan and 3.0 million of stock option exercise proceeds, partially offset by 25.3 million of share repurchases, 2.9 million of debt issuance costs and 0.7 million of term loan repayments. 
 Management assessment of liquidity 
 Management believes that our current cash and cash equivalents, the amounts available under our revolving credit facility and cash flows derived from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated short-term and long-term funding for working capital and capital expenditures including amounts to develop new products, fund future stock repurchases and to pursue strategic opportunities. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements, or strategic opportunities that require additional capital. 
 In addition, the Company monitors the capital markets on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. 
 Foreign cash balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 3.8 million and 8.0 million, respectively. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On March 5, 2018, Turtle Beach and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated loan, guaranty and security agreement (the Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. Bank of America ), as administrative agent, collateral agent and security trustee for Lenders (as defined therein), which replaced the then existing asset-based revolving loan agreement. The Credit Facility was amended on each of December 17, 2018, May 31, 2019, and March 10, 2023. The Credit Facility, as amended, expires on March 13, 2027 and provides for a line of credit of up to 50 million inclusive of a sub-facility limit of 10 million for TB Europe, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Turtle Beach. 
 26 

On March 13, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment, dated as of March 13, 2024 (the Fourth Amendment ), by and among the Company, VTB, TBC Holding Company LLC, TB Europe, VTBH, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time and Bank of America, as administrative agent, collateral agent and security trustee for the lenders. 
 The Fourth Amendment provided for, among other things: (i) the acquisition of PDP; (ii) revised the calculation of the U.S. Borrowing Base to include certain acquired assets of PDP equal to the lesser of (a) the sum of the accounts formula amount and the inventory formula amount (each as defined in the Fourth Amendment), (b) 15,000,000, and (c) 30 of the aggregate Revolver Commitments; (iii) extending the maturity date of the Credit Facility from April 1, 2025 to March 13, 2027; and (iv) updated the interest rate and margin terms such that the loans will bear interest at a rate equal to (1) SOFR, (2) the U.S. Base Rate, (3) the Sterling Overnight Index Average Reference Rate SONIA for loans denominated in Sterling, and (4) the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EUIBOR for loans denominated in Euros, plus in each case, an applicable margin, which is between 0.50 and 2.50 for Base Rate Loans and 1.75 and 3.50 for Term SOFR Loans, SONIA Rate Loans and EUIBOR Loans. 
 The maximum credit availability for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility is governed by a borrowing base determined by the application of specified percentages to certain eligible assets, primarily eligible trade accounts receivable and inventories, and is subject to discretionary reserves and revaluation adjustments. The Credit Facility may be used for working capital, the issuance of bank guarantees, letters of credit and other corporate purposes. 
 Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to (i) a rate published by Bank of America or the U.S. Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index BSBY rate for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, (ii) the Sterling Overnight Index Average Reference Rate SONIA for loans denominated in Sterling, (iii) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EUIBOR for loans denominated in Euros, plus in each case, an applicable margin, which is between 0.50 to 2.50 for base rate loans and UK base rate loans, and 1.75 to 3.50 for U.S. BSBY rate loans, U.S. BSBY daily floating rate loans and UK alternative currency loans. In addition, Turtle Beach is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment at a rate ranging from 0.375 to 0.50 and letter of credit fees and agent fees. As of September 30, 2024, interest rates for outstanding borrowings were 8.60 for base rate loans and 6.70 for Term SOFR loans. 
 The Company is subject to quarterly financial covenant testing if certain availability thresholds are not met or certain other events occur (as set forth in the Credit Facility). At such times, the Credit Facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. 
 The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to take certain actions, including the Company s ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates, and encumber and dispose of assets. Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a security interest and lien upon substantially all of the Company s assets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility, as amended, and excess borrowing availability was approximately 21.1 million. 
 Term Loan 
 On March 13, 2024, Turtle Beach and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new financing agreement with Blue Torch Finance, LLC, Blue Torch ), pursuant to which Blue Torch for an aggregate amount of 50 million (the Term Loan Facility ), the proceeds of which were used to (i) fund a portion of the PDP acquisition purchase price; (ii) repay certain existing indebtedness of the acquired business; (iii) to pay fees and expenses related to such transactions and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility will amortize in a monthly amount equal to 0.208333 during the first two years and 0.416667 during the third year and may be prepaid at any time subject to a prepayment premium during the first year of the interest payments payable during the first year plus 3.00 . The Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries which are party to the Term Loan Facility. 
 The Term Loan Facility (a) matures on March 13, 2027; (b) bears interest at a rate equal to (i) a base rate plus 7.25 per annum for Reference Rate Loans and Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 8.25 per annum for SOFR Loans if the total net leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 2.25x and (ii) a base rate plus 6.75 per annum for Reference Rate Loans and SOFR plus 7.75 per annum for SOFR Loans if the total net leverage ratio is less than 2.25x; and (c) is subject to certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant and a quarterly total net leverage ratio covenant. As of September 30, 2024, interest rates for outstanding borrowings was 13.11 . 
 On August 7, 2024, the Company and Blue Torch amended the Term Loan Facility to, among other things, permit the Company to repurchase Company common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed 30 million prior to March 31, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The other material terms of the Term Loan Facility were unchanged. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan Facility.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. For a discussion of the critical estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements, see Critical Accounting Estimates included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. We are currently evaluating the impact of certain recently issued guidance on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. 
 Item 3 - Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company s market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation. 
 The Company has used derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency forward and option contracts, to manage exposure to foreign currency risks, by hedging a portion of its forecasted expenses denominated in British Pounds expected to occur within a year. The effect of exchange rate changes on foreign currency forward and option contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged item. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any derivative financial instruments. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 The Company has exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the British Pound and Euro. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our monetary assets and liabilities that are subject to this exposure are immaterial, therefore the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. This sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable 10 fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues. 
 Inflation Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market risk due to inflationary pressures affecting our costs and demand for the products we sell. In recent years, our business has been affected by global supply chain constraints and unfavorable changes in economic or political conditions in the countries and markets where we operate. Such inflationary pressures have been and could continue to be exacerbated by higher oil prices, geopolitical turmoil, and economic policy actions and could lead to a recessionary environment. Inflationary pressures can also have a negative impact on demand for the products we sell. Reduced or delayed discretionary spending by consumers in response to inflationary pressures has reduced consumer demand for our products, resulting in reduced sales. 
 We continue to experience the on-going impacts of a higher interest rate environment, as compared to prior years, which resulted in higher cost of goods, selling expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Such increases have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the Company s profit margins if selling prices of products do not increase with the increased costs. 
 28 

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), are designed to ensure that (1) information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (2) that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. At the conclusion of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer (or PEO) and our Principal Financial Officer (or PFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our PEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except that on March 13, 2024, the Company acquired PDP. United States Securities and Exchange Commission guidance allows companies to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of the internal control over financial reporting during the first year following an acquisition. The Company has integrated PDP s operations into its overall system of internal control over financial reporting. 
 Our process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies, which may be identified during this process. 
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
