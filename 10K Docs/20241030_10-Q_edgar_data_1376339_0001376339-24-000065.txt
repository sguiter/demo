 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a continuing operating basis, the effective tax rates for the Company were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were impacted by a full valuation allowance against the Company s deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company concluded that it was no longer in a cumulative three-year loss on a continuing operations basis, after excluding the effects of permanent book-tax differences. The absence of such negative evidence, coupled with its expectations for future taxable income generation, led to a change in the Company s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Consequently, effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not influenced by a valuation allowance.

 In connection with the execution of the TELA APA, the Company was able to renegotiate the terms of the TELA-Regenity Supply Agreement, ultimately replacing it with a new Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the Supply Agreement with Regenity. The Supply Agreement maintains MIMEDX s exclusive right to sell and market the product in the United States. 
 The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets, as substantially all the fair value of the acquired assets was concentrated in the acquired exclusive distribution rights. The cost to acquire the assets on the transaction date was million, reflecting the million of initial consideration, million to acquire inventory, and million, which represented the fair value of the minimum amount of the Profit Share Payments. These costs were allocated amongst the assets acquired. The Company assigned million to the distribution rights acquired and million to inventory. The amount ascribed to the distribution rights will be amortized over , generally reflective of the period of time over which the distribution rights are anticipated to contribute to cash flow generation.

The Company made million payments toward the resolution of legal matters involving the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company paid million toward the resolution of legal matters during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 In addition, in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company received million shares of its own common stock in the settlement of certain legal matters. The Company accounted for the repayment of shares as a loss recovery, as the repayment related to the recoupment of legal fees previously incurred, but not in excess of the amount originally recorded. The Company recorded million, reflecting the fair value of the returned shares on the date of the prevailing agreement, as a reduction to investigation, restatement and related expense on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, where the legal fees to which this recovery originally related were recorded as they were incurred, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following is a description of certain litigation and regulatory matters to which the Company is a party: 
 
 Welker v. MiMedx et. al. 
 On November 4, 2022, Troy Welker and Min Turner, former option holders of the Company, brought a lawsuit in Fulton County State Court against the Company, former directors Terry Dewberry and Charles Evans, and former officers Parker H. Pete Petit, William C. Taylor, and Michael Senken alleging violations of the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations RICO Act against all defendants, and conspiracy to violate the Georgia RICO Act and breach of fiduciary duty against the individual defendants. In August 2024, the parties reached a settlement and the matter is resolved. 

The Company received a determination letter in March 2024 reaffirming the FDA s position that AXIOFILL does not meet the regulatory classification requirements of a Human Cell, Tissue or Cellular or Tissue-based Product under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. The Company strongly disagrees with this determination. On March 25, 2024, MIMEDX filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Robert Califf, M.D. in his official capacity as Commissioner of Food and Drugs at FDA alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asking the Court to vacate FDA s designation, declare FDA s designation as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law, and declare that AXIOFILL meets the criteria to be regulated under Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act. The parties have each filed motions for summary judgment in the case; briefing on the motions is expected to be completed by November 7, 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 Executive Summary 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company delivered 2.9 growth in net sales year-over-year. Growth in the third quarter was seen in private office sites and was relatively balanced between Wound Surgical products. In particular, the Company saw growth of its EPIEFFECT and AMNIOEFFECT products and initial contributions associated with sales of our recently launched HELIOGEN product, partially offset by commercial challenges associated with recent turnover of certain of our sales team and customers, declines in sales of AXIOFILL and the conclusion of sales of our dental product during the third quarter 2023. 
 
 Operational and financial highlights during the quarter included: 
 Net sales of 84.1 million, reflecting 2.9 growth over the prior year period. 
 GAAP net income from continuing operations and net income margin for the third quarter of 2024 of 7.9 million and 9.4 , respectively. 
 Showcased leading allograft portfolio and latest scientific and clinical evidence at Symposium on Advanced Wound Care (SAWC) Fall.

Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Net sales 84,057 81,712 2,345 2.9 Cost of sales 15,322 14,790 532 3.6 Gross profit 68,735 66,922 1,813 2.7 Selling, general and administrative 53,516 52,571 945 1.8 Research and development 2,918 3,075 (157) (5.1) Investigation, restatement and related 649 (38) 687 nm Amortization of intangible assets 192 190 2 1.1 Impairment of intangible assets 298 298 nm Interest income (expense), net 278 (1,680) 1,958 nm Other expense, net (21) (11) (10) 90.9 Income tax provision (3,541) (591) (2,950) nm Net income from continuing operations 7,878 8,842 (964) (10.9) 
 Changes noted as nm in the table above indicate that the percentage change is not meaningful. 
 Net Sales 
 We recorded net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 84.1 million, a 2.3 million, or 2.9 , increase compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, in which we recognized net sales of 81.7 million. 
 Our sales by product line were as follows (amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Wound 
 55,052 51,156 3,896 7.6 Surgical 
 29,005 30,556 (1,551) (5.1) Total 84,057 81,712 2,345 2.9 
 Net sales of our Wound product portfolio were 55.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 3.9 million or 7.6 increase compared to 51.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by contributions from EPIEFFECT, partially offset by commercial challenges associated with competitive behavior in the marketplace as well as headwinds relating to turnover of certain of our sales team and customers. 
 Net sales of our Surgical products totaled 29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of 1.6 million, or 5.1 , compared to 30.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales growth from certain Surgical products, particularly AMNIOEFFECT, as well as initial contributions associated with sales of our recently launched HELIOGEN product, were more than offset by challenges in certain regions where we have recently experienced higher than normal employee turnover and, to a lesser degree, by declines in sales of AXIOFILL during the quarter. In addition, Surgical sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 includes 1.4 million of sales of our dental product which we have since discontinued. 
 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 15.3 million and 14.8 million, respectively, an increase of 0.5 million, or 3.6 , year-over-year. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 81.8 compared to 81.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in cost of sales were driven by increases in sales volume. The year-over-year reduction in gross margin was driven by the amortization of distribution rights stemming from the TELA Asset Purchase Agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2024, as described below. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and our continued execution on yield and scrap improvement projects.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.5 million, compared to 52.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.9 million, or 1.8 , year-over-year. The increase in SG A expense was driven by year-over-year increases in compensation related to higher salary and benefit costs from merit raises and promotions, as well as commissions driven by increases in sales volumes and proportionally higher sales through sales agents. Incremental spend from legal and regulatory disputes in the current period also contributed to the increase, including our ongoing litigation with a competitor and several former employees. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Our research and development R D expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million, compared to 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of 0.2 million. R D spend in the quarter was driven, in part, by the randomized controlled trial for EPIEFFECT and ongoing investments in the development of future products in our pipeline. 
 
 Investigation, Restatement and Related Expense (Benefit) 
 Investigation, restatement and related expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of 0.6 million compared to an immaterial benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from a negotiated reductions in legal fees previously incurred under indemnification agreements with certain former members of management during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by the last material payment towards the resolution of the historical Audit Committee investigation during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect activity to be material in future periods. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization expense related to intangible assets was 0.2 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Impairment of Intangible Assets 
 Impairment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3 million, which relates to abandoned patents. 
 Interest Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest income, net was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net interest expense of 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was the result of a reduction in outstanding debt, lower interest rates under the new Citizens Credit Facilities compared to our previous borrowings, and improvements in our treasury management. 
 Income Tax Provision Expense 
 The effective tax rates for the Company were 31.0 and 6.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflected a valuation allowance against all of the Company s deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we concluded that we were no longer in a cumulative three-year loss on a continuing operations basis, after excluding the effects of permanent book-tax differences. The absence of such negative evidence, coupled with our expectations for future taxable income generation, led to a change in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was not influenced by a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which had an unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by restricted stock vestings, offset by executive compensation deduction limitations. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Net sales 255,972 234,645 21,327 9.1 Cost of sales 43,164 40,792 2,372 5.8 Gross profit 212,808 193,853 18,955 9.8 Selling, general and administrative 164,044 156,773 7,271 4.6 Research and development 8,770 10,232 (1,462) (14.3) Investigation, restatement and related (8,741) 4,652 (13,393) nm Amortization of intangible assets 572 570 2 0.4 Impairment of intangible assets 352 352 nm Interest expense, net (1,409) (4,864) 3,455 (71.0) Other expense, net (357) (42) (315) nm Income tax provision expense (11,485) (569) (10,916) nm Net income from continuing operations 34,560 16,151 18,409 nm 
 Changes noted as nm in the table above indicate that the percentage change is not meaningful. 
 Net Sales 
 We recorded net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 256.0 million, a 21.3 million, or 9.1 , increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for which we recorded net sales of 234.6 million. 
 Our sales by product were as follows (amounts in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Wound 169,647 149,681 19,966 13.3 Surgical 86,325 84,964 1,361 1.6 Total 255,972 234,645 21,327 9.1 
 Net sales of our Wound product portfolio were 169.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 20.0 million or 13.3 increase compared to 149.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by contributions from EPIEFFECT, which did not have comparative sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by commercial challenges associated with competitive behavior in the marketplace. 
 Net sales of our Surgical products totaled 86.3 million, reflecting growth of 1.4 million, or 1.6 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by growing volume contributions from AMNIOEFFECT and AMNIOFIX, as well as initial contributions associated with sales of our recently launched HELIOGEN product, partially offset by lower sales of AXIOFILL compared to the prior year period. In addition, Surgical sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects approximately 3 million of sales of our dental product which we have since discontinued. 
 Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin 
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.2 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 5.8 , compared to 40.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 83.1 compared to 82.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in cost of sales were driven by increases in sales volume. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by favorable product mix and our continued execution on yield and scrap improvement projects, partially offset by the amortization of distribution rights stemming from the TELA Asset Purchase Agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.3 million, or 4.6 , to 164.0 million, compared to 156.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SG A expenses 
 24 

was driven by year-over-year increases in compensation related to higher salary and benefit costs from merit raises and promotions, as well as commissions driven by increases in sales volumes and proportionally higher sales through sales agents. Incremental spend from legal and regulatory disputes in the current period also contributed to the increase, including our ongoing litigation with a competitor and several former employees. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Our research and development expenses decreased 1.5 million, or 14.3 , to 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was driven primarily by lower headcount and the timing of R D activities compared to the prior year. 
 Investigation, Restatement and Related Expense 
 Investigation, restatement and related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a benefit of 8.7 million compared to expense of 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The benefit resulted from various settlements related to former officers and other related matters as well as negotiated reductions in legal fees previously incurred under indemnification agreements with certain former members of management during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was offset by the last material payment towards the resolution of our historical Audit Committee investigation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect activity to be material in future periods . 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization expense related to intangible assets was 0.6 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2023. 
 Impairment of Intangible Assets 
 Impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.4 million, which relates to abandoned patents. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was the result of a decrease in outstanding debt, lower interest rates under the Citizens Credit Facilities, and improvements in our treasury management. The decrease was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt due to repaying and terminating a previous loan agreement during the first quarter of 2024 1.4 million). 
 Income Tax Provision Expense 
 The effective tax rates for the Company were 24.9 and 3.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we noted that we were no longer in a cumulative three-year loss on a continuing operations basis, after excluding the effects of permanent book-tax differences. The absence of such negative evidence, coupled with our expectations for future taxable income generation, led to a change in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Consequently, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was not influenced by a valuation allowance reflected against deferred tax assets, which had an unfavorable impact on the effective tax rate. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by vestings of restricted stock units, offset by executive compensation deduction limitations. 
 
 Discussion of Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 47.4 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily the result of year-over-year increases in net sales, which drove increases in collections from customers. 
 Investing Activities 
 25 

Net cash used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.8 million, compared to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was largely the result of our investment to expand our product portfolio through the TELA and Regenity agreements, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the repayment of the initial 30.0 million drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources, deferred financing costs and other payments made as part of the Debt Refinancing Transactions, as defined below, and stock repurchases for tax withholdings upon vesting of employee stock awards. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We require capital for our operating activities, including costs associated with the sale of product through direct and indirect sales channels, research and development activities, compliance costs, costs to sell and market our products, regulatory fees, and legal and consulting fees in connection with ongoing litigation and other matters. We generally fund our operating capital requirements through our operating activities and cash reserves. We expect to use capital to invest in the broadening of our product portfolio, including through potential acquisitions, licensing agreements or other arrangements, the international expansion of our business and certain capital projects. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 88.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, total current assets of 172.1 million and total current liabilities of 41.9 million, reflecting a current ratio of 4.1. We had no borrowings outstanding and 75 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). 
 The Company is currently paying its obligations in the ordinary course of business. We believe that our cash from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and available credit under the Citizens Credit Agreement, as defined below, will enable us to meet our operational liquidity needs for the twelve months following the filing date of this Quarterly Report. 
 Citizens Credit Facilities 
 On January 19, 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Citizens Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks comprised of Citizens Bank, N.A. as administrative agent (the Agent ), and Bank of America, N.A. The Citizens Credit Agreement was designed to simultaneously improve our capital structure, providing the ability to refinance our prior 50 million senior secured term loan under the Hayfin Loan Agreement (as defined below) at lower interest rates and have access to additional borrowing capacity that could be deployed in the future in support of our organic and potential inorganic growth objectives. 
 The Citizens Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to 95.0 million consisting of: (i) a 75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with a 10.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a 10.0 million swingline loan sublimit, and (ii) a 20.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities ). All obligations are required to be paid in full on January 19, 2029 (the Maturity Date ), and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the guarantors pursuant to a customary security agreement. Subject to the terms of the Citizens Credit Agreement, we have the option to obtain one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to the greater of (i) 50.0 million and (ii) 1.00 times our Consolidated EBITDA as defined therein, each subject to the existing or any new lenders election to extend additional term loans or revolving commitments. 
 At our option, borrowings under the Citizens Credit Agreement (other than any swingline loan) will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Alternate Base Rate, as defined therein, or (ii) a Term SOFR as defined therein, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 and 2.50 with respect to Alternate Base Rate borrowings and 2.25 and 3.50 for Term SOFR borrowings. Swingline loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one-month Term SOFR plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin will be determined based on the Company s consolidated total net leverage ratio. 
 We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit fees, and other customary fees to the Agent and the Lenders. The Term Loan Facility will amortize on a quarterly basis at 1.25 (for year one and two), 1.875 (for year three and four), and 2.5 (for year five) based on the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility at inception, with the remainder due on the Maturity Date. We must make mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset dispositions and casualty events, subject in each case to customary reinvestment 
 26 

rights. We may prepay borrowings under the Credit Facilities at any time, without premium or penalty, and may, at its option, reduce the aggregate unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in whole or in part, in each case subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement. We must also comply with certain financial covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as well as other customary restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facilities. 
 On January 19, 2024, we borrowed 30.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and 20.0 million under the Term Loan Facility. Proceeds from the initial drawings under the Credit Facilities, together with cash on hand, were used to repay in full the 50.0 million principal amount and other obligations under that certain Loan Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2020 (as amended from time to time), by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Hayfin Services LLP, as administrative and collateral agent (as amended from time to time, the Hayfin Loan Agreement and to pay related fees, premiums, costs and expenses (collectively with the entry into the Citizens Credit Agreement and the initial borrowings thereunder, the Debt Refinancing Transactions ). 
 On February 27, 2024, we repaid the initial 30.0 million drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Except as described below, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in the section Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results from Operations , in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 TELA and Regenity Agreements 
 On March 15, 2024, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the TELA APA with TELA Bio, Inc. TELA and a manufacturing and supply agreement (the Supply Agreement with Regenity Biosciences, Inc. Regenity ), adding to the Company s product portfolio a 510(k)-cleared collagen particulate xenograft product now marketed as HELIOGEN HELIOGEN indicated for the management of moderately to heavily exudating wounds and to control minor bleeding. Under the terms of the TELA APA, the Company made an initial 5.0 million payment to TELA and will be required to make additional future payments aggregating between a minimum of 3.0 million and a maximum of 7.0 million, based on net sales of HELIOGEN over the next two years from June 2024. 
 The Supply Agreement maintains MIMEDX s exclusive right to sell and market HELIOGEN in the United States and requires MIMEDX to purchase a minimum amount of HELIOGEN from Regenity annually through December 31, 2033. Should MIMEDX fail to meet a purchasing minimum in any one period, it has the option (among others) to amend its distribution rights under the Supply Agreement to be non-exclusive. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In preparing financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. We regularly review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures. A summary of critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements was provided in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For the effect of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We do not hedge against interest rate risk. 
 The interest rate on our Term Loan Facility is determined quarterly based on the 1-month term SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on our Term Loan Facility was 7.9 . A 100 basis point change in SOFR would change our interest expense by 0.2 million on an annualized basis. 
 27 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
