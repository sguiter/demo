DIANTHUS THERAPEUTICS, INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSE D CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated) 
 At the effective time of the Reverse Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of shares of Company common stock to the Former Dianthus stockholders, based on the exchange ratio of approximately shares of Company common stock for each share of Former Dianthus common stock, including those shares of Former Dianthus common stock issued upon the conversion of Former Dianthus preferred stock and those shares of the Former Dianthus common stock issued in the pre-closing financing (as defined below), resulting in shares of Company common stock being issued and outstanding following the effective time of the Reverse Merger. At the effective time of the Reverse Merger, the 2019 Stock Plan (as discussed in Note 12) was assumed by the Company, and each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Former Dianthus common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Merger was assumed by the Company and converted into an option to purchase shares of Company common stock, with necessary adjustments to the number of shares and exercise price to reflect the exchange ratio, and each outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Former Dianthus common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Merger (including the Former Dianthus pre-funded warrants sold in the pre-closing financing) was converted into a warrant to purchase shares of Company common stock, with necessary adjustments to the number of shares and exercise price to reflect the exchange ratio.

. On September 11, 2023, prior to the effective time of the Reverse Merger, the Company entered into a contingent value rights agreement (the CVR Agreement with a rights agent, pursuant to which pre-Reverse Merger holders of Magenta common stock received one non-transferable contingent value right (each, a CVR for each outstanding share of Magenta common stock held by such stockholder immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Merger on September 11, 2023. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the CVR Agreement, each CVR represents the contractual right to receive a pro rata portion of the proceeds, if any, received by the Company as a result of (i) contingent payments made to the Company, such as milestone, royalty or earnout, when received under any pre-Reverse Merger disposition agreements related to Magenta s pre-Reverse Merger assets and (ii) the Company s sale of assets after the effective date of the Reverse Merger and prior to December 31, 2023, in each case, received within a three-year period following the closing of the Reverse Merger. As of September 30, 2024, no payments have been received under the CVR Agreement. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, and in order to provide Former Dianthus with additional capital for its development programs, Former Dianthus entered into a subscription agreement, as amended (the Subscription Agreement ), with certain investors named therein (the Investors ), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Agreement, immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Merger, Former Dianthus issued and sold, and the Investors purchased, (i) shares of Former Dianthus common stock and (ii) pre-funded warrants, exercisable for shares of Former Dianthus common stock, at a purchase price of approximately per share or per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million (the pre-closing financing ). 2024 Private Placement On January 22, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors. At the closing of the private placement on January 24, 2024, the Company sold and issued shares of common stock at a price per share of , and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price of per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share purchase price of the common stock less the per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time after the date of issuance. A holder of pre-funded warrants may not exercise the warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. A holder of pre-funded warrants may increase or decrease this percentage to a percentage not in excess of by providing at least 61 days prior notice to the Company. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, uncertainty of product development and commercialization, lack of marketing and sales history, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on its key personnel, market acceptance of products, product liability, protection of proprietary technology, ability to raise additional financing and compliance with government regulations. If the Company does not successfully commercialize any of its product candidates, it will be unable to generate recurring product revenue or achieve profitability. The Company s lead product candidate that is in development and any future product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure, and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if its product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate revenue from product sales.

million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024; 

 The Company expects to continue to incur significant recurring losses and rely on outside capital to fund its operations for the foreseeable future; and 

 As of the issuance date, the Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand will be sufficient to fund its obligations as they become due for at least twelve months beyond the issuance date. The Company expects that its research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase significantly, including in connection with conducting clinical trials and manufacturing for its existing product candidate and any future product candidates to support commercialization and providing general and administrative support for its operations, including the costs associated with operating as a public company. 

 In the event the Company is unable to secure additional outside capital, management will be required to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, a delay or termination of clinical trials or the development of its product candidates, temporary or permanent curtailment of the Company s operations, a sale of assets, or other alternatives with strategic or financial partners.

 t have any leases classified as finance leases. Management have elected the practical expedient to exclude short-term leases from right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company s leases do not have significant rent escalation, holidays, concessions, material residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants or contingent rent provisions. The Company s leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent, taxes, and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area or other maintenance costs), which are accounted for as a single lease component as management have elected the practical expedient to group lease and non-lease components for all leases.

The fair value of common stock is based on quoted market prices. 2019 Stock Plan In July 2019, Former Dianthus Board of Directors adopted, and the Former Dianthus stockholders approved, the Dianthus Therapeutics, Inc. 2019 Stock Plan (the 2019 Stock Plan ). In connection with the Reverse Merger, the Company assumed options to purchase shares of Former Dianthus s common stock that were outstanding under the 2019 Stock Plan immediately prior to the Reverse Merger and such options were converted into options to purchase shares of Company s common stock (the Assumed Options ). No further awards will be made under the 2019 Stock Plan; however, the Assumed Options will remain outstanding under the 2019 Stock Plan in accordance with their terms, as adjusted to reflect the Reverse Merger. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Employees may elect to participate in the Dianthus Therapeutics, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the ESPP ).

million for the exercise of the corresponding option. In addition, in connection with the exercise of the Zenas Option, Zenas was required to reimburse the Company for a portion of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls-related CMC costs and expenses from the date of delivery of its option exercise notice through the execution of a license agreement. In June 2022, the Company and Zenas executed the license agreement Zenas License ). The Zenas Option and Zenas License are collectively referred to as the Zenas Agreements. The Zenas License provides Zenas with a license in the People s Republic of China, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, for the development and commercialization of sequences and products under the first antibody sequence. The Company is also obligated to perform certain research and development and CMC services and will also participate in a joint steering committee JSC ). Under the Zenas License, Zenas also has the right to exercise an option with respect to a second antibody sequence. If Zenas exercises the option and pays the Company the option exercise fee related to the second antibody sequence, the Company will grant Zenas an exclusive license to the sequences and products under this second antibody sequence. Since the Zenas Agreements were negotiated with a single commercial objective, they are treated as a combined contract for accounting purposes. The Company assessed the Zenas Agreements in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that it represents a contract with a customer and is within the scope of ASC 606. The Company determined that there is one combined performance obligation that consists of the license and data transfer, the research and development and CMC services and the participation in the JSC. The Company determined that Zenas right to exercise an option with respect to a second antibody sequence does not represent a material right. The consideration under the Zenas Agreements includes the following payments by Zenas to the Company: (i) a million upfront payment upon execution of the Zenas License; (ii) an approximate million payment representing reimbursement for a portion of development costs previously incurred by the Company; (iii) reimbursement of a portion of all CMC-related costs and expenses for the first antibody sequence through the manufacture of the first two batches of drug product; (iv) reimbursement of a portion of all non-CMC-related costs and expenses for the development of the first antibody sequence through the first regulatory approval; (v) development milestones totaling up to million; and (vi) royalties on net sales ranging from the mid-single digits to the low teen percentages. The Company determined that the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time; therefore, the Company will recognize the transaction price from the license agreement over the Company s estimated period to complete its activities. The Company concluded that it will utilize a cost-based input method to measure its progress toward completion of its performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize each period. The Company believes this is the best measure of progress because other measures do not reflect how the Company transfers its performance obligation to Zenas. In applying the cost-based input method of revenue recognition, the Company uses actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs expected to be incurred for the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs. Revenue will be recognized based on the level of costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs for the combined performance obligation. A cost-based input method of revenue recognition requires management to make estimates of costs to complete the Company s performance obligation. In making such estimates, judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. The Company also determined that the milestone payments of million are variable consideration under ASC 606 which need to be added to the transaction price when it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Based on the nature of the milestones, such as the regulatory approvals which are generally not within the Company s control, the Company will not consider achievement of this milestone to be probable until the uncertainty associated with such milestone has been resolved. When it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur, the milestone payment will be added to the transaction price for which the Company recognizes revenue. As of September 30, 2024, no milestones had been achieved. 

 20 

royalty revenue had been recognized. The Company recognized related party license revenue totaling million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, associated with the Zenas Agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a related party receivable of million, unbilled related party receivable of million, current deferred related party revenue of million and noncurrent deferred related party revenue of million on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a related party receivable of million, unbilled related party receivable of million, current deferred related party revenue of million and noncurrent deferred related party revenue of million on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

shares of common stock to the Company in exchange for the Zenas Option. Previously, the Company used the measurement alternative as the measurement attribute for accounting for the Zenas common stock which did not require it to assess the fair value of the common stock at each reporting period as the fair value of the Zenas common stock was not readily determinable nor was there a reliable source for observable transactions from which the Company could determine a fair value.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of F inancial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing next-generation complement therapeutics for patients living with severe autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We believe our lead novel and proprietary monoclonal antibody product candidate, DNTH103, has the potential to address a broad array of complement-dependent diseases as currently available therapies or those in development leave room for improvements in efficacy, safety, and/or dosing convenience. We have purposefully engineered DNTH103 to selectively bind to only the active form of the C1s complement protein C1s and to exhibit improved potency and an extended half-life. By selectively targeting only the active form of C1s, which drives disease pathology and constitutes only a small fraction of the total protein present in circulation, we aim to reduce the amount of drug required for a therapeutic effect. We intend to deliver our product candidate through a lower dose, less frequent, self-administered, convenient subcutaneous S.C. injection suitable for an auto-injector. 
 Our most advanced product candidate, DNTH103, is a clinical-stage, highly potent, highly selective and fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 with picomolar binding affinity that is designed to selectively bind only to the active form of the C1s complement protein, while leaving the lectin and alternative pathways intact. DNTH103 is also engineered with YTE half-life extension technology, a specific three amino acid change in the Fc domain, and has a pharmacokinetic profile designed to support less frequent, lower dose, self-administration as a convenient S.C. injection. As a result of its more targeted profile, we aim to demonstrate that DNTH103 may have a reduced risk of infections from encapsulated bacteria when compared to C5 terminal inhibitors, thus potentially avoiding a FDA Boxed Warning and associated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy REMS ). The active form of C1s is generated during complement activation by cleavage of the inactive proenzyme C1s. As a validated complement target in the autoimmune and inflammatory field, C1s inhibition prevents further progression of the classical pathway cascade. We believe that DNTH103 has the potential to yield therapeutic benefit in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory disease indications where inappropriate activation of the classical pathway cascade drives or exacerbates the disease pathology by inhibiting the ability of activated C1s to effect downstream complement activity, ameliorating complement mediated cell death and disruption of normal cellular function. 
 Data reported from DNTH103 s Phase 1 clinical trial in 60 healthy volunteers across eight dose cohorts validates the extended half-life and potent classical pathway inhibition and supports a potentially differentiated safety profile of DNTH103. The topline data confirmed its approximately 60-day half-life and highly potent classical pathway inhibition with every two weeks S.C. dosing of 300mg/2mL surpassing the calculated IC90 of 87ug/mL, establishing DNTH103 s best-in-class potential to be the first self-administered subcutaneous injection dosed as infrequently as every two weeks to treat a range of autoimmune disorders. Based on the clinical data available to date, DNTH103 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or complement-related infections. 
 In February 2024, we announced the initiation of our Phase 2 MaGic trial of DNTH103 in patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis gMG ). The initiation followed clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA of the Phase 2 Investigational New Drug IND application for DNTH103. The Phase 2 MaGic trial is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in up to 60 patients with gMG who are acetylcholine receptor antibody positive. Following an initial loading dose, DNTH103 will be administered every two weeks via S.C. injection. The S.C. treatment duration will initially be 12 weeks with a 52-week open-label extension. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints include Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Scale MG-ADL and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis QMG score assessments. Initial top-line results from this trial are anticipated to be available in the second half of 2025. 
 25 

In June 2024, we announced clearance of our Phase 2 IND application by the FDA for the MoMeNtum trial of DNTH103 in patients with Multifocal Motor Neuropathy MMN ). The MoMeNtum trial is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DNTH103 in 36 patients with MMN. Following determination of immunoglobulin Ig dependency and responsiveness, patients will be randomized to receive a placebo or DNTH103, administered every two weeks via S.C. injection. The initial S.C. treatment duration is expected to be 17 weeks followed by a 52-week open-label extension. The primary endpoint of this trial is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints include time to intravenous Ig retreatment, time to relapse, and assessments of muscle and grip strength. Initial top-line results from this trial are anticipated to be available in the second half of 2026. 
 We plan to initiate a single, two-part (Part A and Part B) Phase 3 trial of DNTH103 in patients with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy CIDP by the end of 2024. The planned trial will be a global, randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in adult patients with CIDP. In the open-label Part A of this trial, participants will be administered a loading dose followed by 300mg of DNTH103 administered every two weeks via S.C. injection for up to 13 weeks. Part A includes an interim responder analysis of a pre-defined number of participants. Only participants who respond to DNTH103 in Part A will be randomized into Part B, a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of up to 52 weeks, where they will be assessed for prevention of relapse, safety and tolerability, followed by an open-label extension period. We believe this single pivotal trial may support a Biologics License Application BLA filing in adult patients with CIDP. We anticipate providing additional information regarding the Phase 3 trial design and timelines by the end of 2024. 
 Shelf Registration Statement and ATM Offering Program 
 On October 1, 2024, we filed a registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, rights and units up to an aggregate of 500.0 million. On October 9, 2024, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. The registration statement includes an ATM offering program for the sale of up to 200.0 million of shares of our common stock. 
 2024 Private Placement 
 On January 22, 2024, in order to provide us with additional capital for our development programs, we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors. At the closing of the private placement on January 24, 2024, we sold and issued 14,500,500 shares of common stock at a price per share of 12.00, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,666,332 shares of common stock at a purchase price of 11.999 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share purchase price of the common stock less the 0.001 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 230 million. 
 Completion of the Reverse Merger and Pre-Closing Financing 
 On September 11, 2023, we completed a business combination with Former Dianthus pursuant to which, among other matters, Former Dianthus became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours (the Reverse Merger ). In connection with the completion of the Reverse Merger, we changed our name from Magenta Therapeutics, Inc. to Dianthus Therapeutics, Inc., and the business conducted by us became primarily the business conducted by Former Dianthus. 
 Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, and in order to provide Former Dianthus with additional capital for its development programs, Former Dianthus entered into a subscription agreement, as amended, with certain investors named therein. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Merger, Former Dianthus sold and issued 2,873,988 shares of Former Dianthus common stock and 210,320 pre-funded warrants, exercisable for 210,320 shares of Former Dianthus common stock, at a purchase price of approximately 23.34 per share or 23.34 per warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 72 million (the pre-closing financing ).

Background 
 Since our inception in 2019, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to conducting research and development activities (including with respect to the DNTH103 program) and undertaking preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials and the manufacturing of the product used in our clinical trials and preclinical studies, business planning, developing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these activities. 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any significant laboratory or manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the testing and manufacture of our product candidates, as well as for commercial manufacturing should any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need to invest in our own significant laboratory and manufacturing facilities, equipment, and personnel while also enabling us to focus expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. 
 To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of capital stock and have raised aggregate gross proceeds of 423.5 million from private placements. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 342.6 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments should be sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of 2027. Until we achieve profitability, we plan to fund our operations and capital expenditures with cash on hand and expect to seek to raise any necessary additional capital through private or public equity or debt financings, loans or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, partnerships or other marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we will be required to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, a delay or termination of our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates, temporary or permanent curtailment of our operations, a sale of our assets, or other alternatives with strategic or financial partners. 
 We have incurred significant recurring losses. We generated net losses of 56.5 million and 33.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 146.0 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on a variety of factors, including the timing, scope and results of our research and development activities. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we: 
 advance the DNTH103 program through clinical development, including in any additional indications; 

advance discovery programs from preclinical development into and through clinical development; 

seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

establish sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates; 

contract to manufacture any of our investigational or approved product candidates; 

expand clinical, scientific, management and administrative teams; 

maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; 

acquire or in-license other product candidates or technologies; 

implement operational, financial and management systems; and 

operate as a public company. 

27 

We do not have any products approved for commercial sale and we have not generated any commercial revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve and maintain profitability will depend upon the successful development and eventual commercialization of DNTH103 or any future product candidates, which we expect, if it ever occurs, will take many years. We expect to spend a significant amount on development and marketing costs prior to such time. We will therefore require substantial additional capital to develop DNTH103 and any future product candidates and to support our continuing operations. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory and marketing approval for DNTH103 or any future product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our preclinical and clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay, or modify preclinical and clinical trials of DNTH103 or any future product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Accordingly, until such time that we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from product sales or other sources, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through private or public equity or debt financings, loans or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, partnerships or other marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. However, we may be unable to raise additional capital from these sources on favorable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including requiring us to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, a delay or termination of our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates, temporary or permanent curtailment of our operations, a sale of our assets, or other alternatives with strategic or financial partners. We may also be required to license rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. We cannot provide assurance that we will ever generate positive cash flow from operating activities. See the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Global and Macroeconomic Developments 
 Uncertainty in the global economy presents significant risks to our business. We are subject to continuing risks and uncertainties in connection with legislative, regulatory, political, geopolitical and macroeconomic developments beyond our control, including inflationary pressures, general economic slowdown or a recession, high interest rates, changes in monetary policy or foreign currency exchange rates, instability in financial institutions, the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, rising tensions between China and Taiwan, the attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red Sea and the responses thereto, pandemics or other public health crises and supply chain disruptions. While we are closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on all aspects of our business, including the impacts on participants in our clinical trials, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and regulators, the ultimate extent of the impact on our business remains highly uncertain and will depend on future developments and factors that continue to evolve. Most of these developments and factors are outside of our control and could exist for an extended period of time. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the potential impacts to Dianthus business, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For additional information, see the section titled Risk Factors found elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sales of products in the foreseeable future. 
 We are party to an option agreement and license agreement with Zenas BioPharma, Inc. (formerly Zenas BioPharma Limited) Zenas BioPharma ), a related party. In September 2020, we entered into an option agreement with Zenas BioPharma Zenas Option ), through which we provided Zenas BioPharma an option to enter into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of products arising from our research of monoclonal antibody antagonists targeting certain specific complement proteins. In June 2022, we and Zenas BioPharma executed a license agreement Zenas License Agreement ). The Zenas Option and Zenas License Agreement are collectively referred to as the Zenas Agreements. The Zenas License Agreement provides Zenas BioPharma with a license in the People s Republic of China, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, for the development and commercialization of sequences and products under the first antibody sequence. 
 28 

Under the Zenas Agreements, the consideration payable by Zenas BioPharma includes the following: (i) a 1.0 million upfront payment upon execution of the Zenas License Agreement; (ii) an approximate 1.1 million payment representing reimbursement for a portion of development costs previously incurred by us; (iii) reimbursement of a portion of costs related to chemistry, manufacturing and control CMC and expenses for the first antibody sequence through the manufacture of the first two batches of drug product; (iv) reimbursement of a portion of non-CMC-related costs and expenses for the development of the first antibody sequence through the first regulatory approval; (v) development milestones totaling up to 11.0 million; and (vi) royalties on net sales ranging from mid-single digits to low teen percentages. 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), we determined that there is one combined performance obligation that consists of the license and data transfer, the CMC and non-CMC services and the participation in a joint steering committee, and that the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time. Therefore, we will recognize the transaction price from the license agreement over our estimated period to complete our activities. We concluded that we would utilize a cost-based input method to measure our progress toward completion of our performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize each period. We believe this is the best measure of progress because other measures do not reflect how we transfer our performance obligation to Zenas BioPharma. In applying the cost-based input method of revenue recognition, we use actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs expected to be incurred for the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs. Revenue will be recognized based on the level of costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs for the performance obligations. A cost-based input method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of costs to complete the performance obligation. In making such estimates, judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. 
 There is a sales or usage-based royalty exception within ASC 606 that applies when a license of intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates. In accordance with this royalty exception, we will recognize royalty revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no royalty revenue had been recognized. 
 We also determined that the milestone payments of 11.0 million are variable consideration under ASC 606, which need to be added to the transaction price when it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Based on the nature of the milestones, such as the regulatory approvals which are generally not within our control, we will not consider achievement of this milestone to be probable until the uncertainty associated with such milestone has been resolved. When it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur, the milestone payment will be added to the transaction price for which we recognize revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no milestones had been achieved. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized related party license revenue totaling 2.2 million and 0.9 million, respectively, associated with the Zenas Agreements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized related party license revenue totaling 4.9 million and 2.4 million, respectively, associated with the Zenas Agreements. 
 If our development efforts for DNTH103 or any future product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue from future product sales. If we enter into license or collaboration agreements for DNTH103 or any future product candidates or intellectual property, revenue may be generated in the future from such license or collaboration agreements. We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of DNTH103 or any future product candidates or from license or collaboration agreements. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for DNTH103 or any future product candidates. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of DNTH103 and other potential product candidates. 
 External expenses include: 
 payments to third parties in connection with research and development, including agreements with third parties such as contract research organizations CROs ), clinical trial sites and consultants; 

the cost of manufacturing products for use in our clinical trials and preclinical studies, including payments to contract development and manufacturing organizations CDMOs and consultants; and 

29 

payments to third parties in connection with the preclinical development of other potential product candidates, including for outsourced professional scientific development services, consulting research and collaborative research. 

Internal expenses include: 
 personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, related benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for employees engaged in research and development functions; and 

facilities-related expenses, depreciation, supplies, travel expenses and other allocated expenses. 

We recognize research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery program and are typically deployed across multiple programs. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. We utilize CROs for research and development activities and CDMOs for manufacturing activities and we do not have significant laboratory or manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we have no material facilities expenses attributed to research and development. 
 Product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over the next several years as we advance DNTH103 into larger and later-stage clinical trials, work to discover and develop additional product candidates, seek to expand, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, and hire additional research and development personnel. 
 The successful development of DNTH103 or any future product candidates is highly uncertain, and we do not believe it is possible at this time to accurately project the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, DNTH103 or any future product candidates. To the extent DNTH103 or any future product candidates continue to advance into larger and later-stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. The duration, costs and timing of development of DNTH103 or any future product candidates are subject to numerous uncertainties and will depend on a variety of factors, including: 
 the timing and progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we pursue; 

our ability to establish a favorable safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies to enable clinical trials; 

successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, larger and later-stage clinical trials; 

per subject trial costs; 

the number and extent of our clinical trials required for regulatory approval; 

the countries in which our clinical trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects in our clinical trials; 

the number of subjects that participate in our clinical trials; 

the drop-out and discontinuation rate of subjects in our clinical trials; 

potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the duration of subject participation in our clinical trials and follow-up; 

the extent to which we encounter any serious adverse events in our clinical trials; 

the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals and post-marketing approval commitments from applicable regulatory authorities; 

the extent to which we establish collaborations, strategic partnerships, or other strategic arrangements with third parties, if any, and the performance of any such third party; 

hiring and retaining research and development personnel; 

our arrangements with our CDMOs and CROs; 

30 

development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our planned clinical trials and for commercial launch; 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work; and 

obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 

Any of these factors could significantly impact the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of DNTH103 or any future product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, bonuses, related benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions; professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting, and audit services; and travel expenses, technology costs and other allocated expenses. General and administrative expenses also include corporate facility costs, including insurance, rent, utilities, depreciation, and maintenance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We recognize general and administrative expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, pre-commercial preparation activities for the product candidates and, if any product candidate receives marketing approval, commercialization activities. In addition, we anticipate that we will incur additional expenses associated with being a public company, including expenses related to accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, public company reporting and compliance, director and officer insurance, investor and public relations, and other administrative and professional services. 
 Other Income/(Expense) 
 Other income/(expense) consists primarily of interest income generated from earnings on invested cash equivalents and investment securities. 
 Income Tax 
 Since inception, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research tax credits due to uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.

License Revenue Related Party 
 Under the terms of the Zenas Agreements, we recognized related party license revenue of 2.2 million and 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased clinical operations activity costs associated with the commencement of DNTH103's Phase 2 clinical trials in gMG and MMN in 2024, along with preparations to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in CIDP by the end of 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 25.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 17.5 million. This increase was due to (1) a 14.0 million increase in external research and development costs, consisting of preclinical study costs, CMC activities, third-party consulting services, clinical operation activities, licensing and milestone payments and discovery activities and (2) a 3.5 million increase in internal research and development costs, consisting of personnel and related costs and stock-based compensation expense. 
 The 14.0 million increase in external research and development costs was due to a 13.8 million increase in expenses related to our lead product candidate, DNTH103, and a 0.2 million increase in discovery activities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were increases in expenses related to DNTH103 of 6.8 million in CMC activities, 5.8 million in clinical operations activities, 0.9 million in preclinical study costs and 0.4 million in licensing and milestone payments, which were partially offset by a decrease of 0.1 million in third-party consulting services related to DNTH103. The increased DNTH103-related costs in CMC activities, clinical operations, preclinical study costs and licensing and milestone payments were primarily due to activities related to the commencement of DNTH103 s Phase 2 clinical trials in gMG and MMN in 2024, along with preparations to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in CIDP by the end of 2024. The 0.2 million increase in expenses related to our discovery activities was due to development activities of potential molecules beyond DNTH103 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The 3.5 million increase in internal research and development costs was due to a 2.2 million increase in personnel and related costs and a 1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increases were due to the buildout of our internal research and development function to support our ongoing and planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 32 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.2 million. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases of 3.4 million in personnel-related costs related to severance costs to former employees of Magenta in the prior period and 1.1 million in director and officer insurance costs related to the Reverse Merger in the prior period. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, 0.7 million in professional services costs and 0.2 million in facilities costs as we continue to build out our general and administrative function to support our operations as a public company and to support our ongoing and planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Other Income/(Expense) 
 Other income was 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 3.4 million in interest income from a larger investment balance and higher interest rates on investments and a 0.3 million gain on an investment in a related party.

License Revenue Related Party 
 Under the terms of the Zenas Agreements, we recognized related party license revenue of 4.9 million and 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased clinical operations activity costs associated with the commencement of DNTH103's Phase 2 clinical trials in gMG and MMN in 2024, along with preparations to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in CIDP by the end of 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 56.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 32.6 million. This increase was due to (1) a 23.7 million increase in external research and development costs, consisting of preclinical study costs, CMC activities, third-party consulting services, clinical operation activities, licensing and milestone payments and discovery activities and (2) a 8.9 million increase in internal research and development costs, consisting of personnel and related costs, stock-based compensation expense, and other costs. 
 33 

The 23.7 million increase in external research and development costs was due to a 23.5 million increase in expenses related to our lead product candidate, DNTH103, and a 0.2 million increase in expenses related to our discovery activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were increases in expenses related to DNTH103 of 11.9 million in clinical operations activities, 9.9 million in CMC activities, 0.9 million in licensing and milestone payments, 0.5 million in third-party consulting services and 0.3 million in preclinical study costs related to DNTH103. The increased DNTH103-related costs in clinical operations, CMC activities, licensing and milestone payments, third-party consulting services and preclinical study costs were primarily due to activities related to the commencement of DNTH103 s Phase 2 clinical trials in gMG and MMN in 2024, along with preparations to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in CIDP by the end of 2024. The 0.2 million increase in expenses related to our discovery activities was due to development activities of potential molecules beyond DNTH103 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The 8.9 million increase in internal research and development costs was due to a 5.2 million increase in personnel and related costs, a 3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a 0.5 million increase in other costs. The increases were due to the buildout of our internal research and development function to support our ongoing and planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.7 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of 3.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, 1.8 million in professional services costs, 1.0 million in third-party consulting services costs and 0.3 million in facilities costs. The increases in costs were due to the buildout of our general and administrative function to support our operations as a public company and to support our ongoing and planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 1.7 million in personnel-related costs related to severance costs to former employees of Magenta in the prior period and 0.3 million in other costs related to the Reverse Merger in the prior period. 
 Other Income/(Expense) 
 Other income was 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 11.2 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 11.1 million in interest income from a larger investment balance and higher interest rates on investments and a 0.3 million gain on an investment in a related party, partially offset by an increase in other expenses of 0.2 million. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of our lead product candidate, DNTH103, or any future product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase significantly, including in connection with conducting clinical trials and manufacturing for our lead product candidate or any future product candidates to support potential future commercialization and providing general and administrative support for our operations, including the costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. See the section titled Risk Factors found elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024 for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements. 
 We have an open market sales agreement with TD Securities (USA) LLC TD Cowen (the ATM Agreement pursuant to which, we may sell from time to time, through TD Cowen, shares of our common stock for an aggregate sales price of up to 200 million. Any sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement are made under our registration statement on Form S-3 which was deemed effective by the SEC on October 9, 2024. We have not sold any shares of our common stock or received any proceeds from the ATM offering program as of the date of this report. 
 To date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of capital stock for gross proceeds of 423.5 million. 
 34 

Future Capital Requirements 
 Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate any meaningful product revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize DNTH103 or any future product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to develop DNTH103 or any future product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities as described in greater detail below. We are subject to all the risks involved in the development of new biopharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may harm our business. 
 In order to complete the development of DNTH103 or any future product candidates and to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional capital. Accordingly, until such time that we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from product sales or other sources, if ever, we expect to seek to raise any necessary additional capital through private or public equity or debt financings, loans or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, partnerships or other marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through equity financings, such as our ATM offering program, or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, including restricting our operations and limiting our ability to incur liens, issue additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in merger, consolidation, licensing, or asset sale transactions. If we raise capital through collaborations, partnerships, and other similar arrangements with third parties, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We may be unable to raise additional capital from these sources on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from bank failures, other general macroeconomic conditions and otherwise. Our failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including requiring us to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, a delay or termination of our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates, temporary or permanent curtailment of our operations, a sale of our assets, or other alternatives with strategic or financial partners. We cannot provide assurance that we will ever generate positive cash flow from operating activities. 
 To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of capital stock and have raised aggregate gross proceeds of 423.5 million. However, we have incurred significant recurring losses. We had an accumulated deficit of 146.0 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 342.6 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments should be sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of 2027. Until we achieve profitability, we plan to fund our operations and capital expenditures with cash on hand and expect to seek to raise any necessary additional capital through private or public equity or debt financings, loans or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, partnerships or other marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to us. Our failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including requiring us to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, a delay or termination of our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates, temporary or permanent curtailment of our operations, a sale of our assets, or other alternatives with strategic or financial partners. 
 We based projections of operating capital requirements on our current operating plan, which includes several assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount and timing of our capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the scope, timing, progress, results, and costs of researching and developing DNTH103, and conducting larger and later-stage clinical trials; 

the scope, timing, progress, results, and costs of researching and developing other future product candidates that we may pursue; 

the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

35 

the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade products and sufficient inventory to support commercial launch; 

the revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of product candidates receive marketing approval; 

the cost and timing of attracting, hiring, and retaining skilled personnel to support our operations and continued growth; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our ability to establish, maintain, and derive value from collaborations, partnerships or other marketing, distribution, licensing, or other strategic arrangements with third parties on favorable terms, if at all; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, if any; and 

the costs associated with operating as a public company. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional capital to meet the capital requirements associated with such operating plans.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Lease Obligations 
 We lease space under operating leases agreements for administrative offices in New York, New York, and Waltham, Massachusetts and wet laboratory space in Watertown, Massachusetts, which expire in February 2031, January 2026 and August 2025, respectively. 
 Research and Development and Manufacturing Agreements 
 We enter into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes manufacturing services with CDMOs and development and clinical trial services with CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payments for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amount of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreement. These obligations and commitments are not presented separately. 
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 In August 2019, Former Dianthus entered into a license agreement with Alloy Therapeutics, LLC Alloy for (i) a worldwide, non-exclusive license to use the Alloy technology solely to generate Alloy antibodies and platform assisted antibodies for internal, non-clinical research purposes, and (ii) with respect to Alloy antibodies and platform assisted antibodies that are selected by us for inclusion into a partnered antibody program, a worldwide, assignable license to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, import, develop, manufacture, and commercialize products comprising partnered antibody programs selected from Alloy antibodies and platform assisted antibodies in any field of use. In addition to annual license fees, we are obligated to pay development and commercial milestone payments of up to 12.8 million for the first partnered antibody, which has been selected for the DNTH103 program. The license agreement was amended in October 2022 to extend the agreement to a potential second partnered antibody. In addition to annual license fees, we are obligated to pay development and commercial milestone payments of up to 18.1 million for a second partnered antibody, if and when selected. 
 In September 2022, Former Dianthus entered into a commercial platform license agreement and services agreement with two subsidiaries of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Ligand ). In November 2022, Ligand spun-off these subsidiaries into a separate legal entity, OmniAb, Inc. OmniAb ). The platform license agreement and services agreement with OmniAb grants us (i) a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license under the OmniAb technology to use chicken animals for generation of OmniAb antibodies for research purposes and (ii) a worldwide, non-exclusive license under the OmniAb technology to use rodent animals for generation of OmniAb antibodies for research purposes. In addition to annual license fees, we are obligated to pay development milestones payments of up to 12.2 million and to pay royalties in the low to mid-single digit percentages. 
 In July 2020, Former Dianthus entered into a collaborative research agreement with IONTAS Limited IONTAS to perform certain milestone-based research and development activities under our first development program. The agreement was amended in January 2023 to extend services to additional development programs. We are obligated to pay development and commercial milestone payments of up to 5.4 million (approximately 7.2 million based on the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) with the first development program and of up to 2.5 million (approximately 3.3 million based on the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) with the second development program.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate estimates and assumptions on a periodic basis. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
 We believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as the policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses are recorded as an expense, as incurred. Research and development expenses consists of (i) costs to engage contractors who specialize in our development activities; (ii) external research and development costs incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, CDMOs and consultants; and (iii) costs associated with preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory operations. 
 We enter into consulting, research, and other agreements with commercial firms, researchers, and others for the provision of goods and services. Under such agreements, we may pay for services on a monthly, quarterly, project or other basis. Such arrangements are generally cancelable upon reasonable notice and payment of costs incurred. Costs are considered incurred based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks under each contract using information and data provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date, whereas payments are dictated by the terms of each agreement. As such, depending on the timing of payment relative to the receipt of goods or services, we may record either prepaid expenses or accrued services. These costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects, as well as fees paid to various entities that perform certain research on our behalf. 
 We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. There may also be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing expenses, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , ASC 718 ). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options and restricted stock, to be recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. All of our stock option awards are subject only to service-based vesting conditions. We estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of assumptions, including (a) the fair value of the common stock, (b) the expected stock price volatility, (c) the calculation of expected term of the award, (d) the risk-free interest rate and (e) expected dividends. We estimate the fair value of the restricted stock awards using the fair value of our common stock. Forfeitures are recognized as they are incurred. 
 38 

Prior to the Reverse Merger, management utilized valuation methodologies in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation , to estimate the fair value of Former Dianthus common stock. Each valuation methodology included estimates and assumptions that required our judgment. These estimates and assumptions included objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions, the prices at which Former Dianthus sold shares of convertible preferred stock, the superior rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock senior to Former Dianthus common stock at the time, and a probability analysis of various liquidity events, such as a public offering or sale of Former Dianthus, under differing scenarios. Changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could have resulted in materially different fair values of Former Dianthus common stock at each valuation date. Following the Reverse Merger, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 Prior to the Reverse Merger, due to a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development and life science industry focus. We believe the group selected had sufficiently similar economic and industry characteristics and includes companies that were most representative of us. Following the Reverse Merger, expected volatility at the date of grant is estimated using a look-back period, which coincides with the expected term, of our stock price as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 We use the simplified method, as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment , to calculate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of paying no dividends. 
 Compensation expense related to stock-based awards is calculated on a straight-line basis by recognizing the grant date fair value, over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. 
 Revenue Recognition Zenas Agreements 
 We analyze the Zenas Agreements pursuant to ASC 606. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. As part of the accounting for contracts with customers, management develops assumptions that require judgment to determine whether promised goods and services represent distinct performance obligations and the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. This evaluation is subjective and requires us to make judgments about the promised goods and services and whether those goods and services are separable from other aspects of the contract. Further, determining the standalone selling price for performance obligations requires significant judgment, and when an observable price of a promised good or service is not readily available, we consider relevant assumptions to estimate the standalone selling price, including, as applicable, market conditions, development timelines, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and forecasted revenues. 
 We evaluate the performance obligations promised in the contract that are based on goods and services that will be transferred to the customer and determined whether those obligations are both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the contract. Goods or services that meet these criteria are considered distinct performance obligations. We estimate the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include fixed consideration or variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of potential transaction price and the likelihood that the transaction price will be received. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method best predicts the amount expected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. 
 We apply judgment in determining whether a combined performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and, if over time, concluding upon the appropriate method of measuring progress to be applied for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, as estimates related to the measure of progress change, related revenue recognition is adjusted accordingly. Changes in the estimated measure of progress are accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. 
 39 

When two or more contracts are entered into with the same customer at or near the same time, we evaluate the contracts to determine whether the contracts should be accounted for as a single arrangement. Contracts are combined and accounted for as a single arrangement if one or more of the following criteria are met: (i) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; (ii) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or (iii) the goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or services promised in each of the contracts) are a single performance obligation. 
 Because the Zenas Agreements were negotiated with a single commercial objective, they are treated as a combined contract for accounting purposes. We assessed the Zenas Agreements in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that it represents a contract with a customer and is within the scope of ASC 606. We determined that there is one combined performance obligation that consists of the license and data transfer, the research and development services and the participation in the joint steering committee. We determined that Zenas BioPharma s right to exercise an option with respect to a second antibody sequence does not represent a material right. 
 We determined that the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time; therefore, we will recognize the transaction price from the license agreement over our estimated period to complete our activities. We concluded that we would utilize a cost-based input method to measure our progress toward completion of our performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize each period. We believe this is the best measure of progress because other measures do not reflect how we transfer our performance obligation to Zenas Biopharma. In applying the cost-based input method of revenue recognition, we use actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs expected to be incurred for the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs. Revenue will be recognized based on the level of costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs for the performance obligations. A cost-based input method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of costs to complete our performance obligation. In making such estimates, judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. We will re-evaluate the estimate of expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation each reporting period and will make adjustments for any significant changes. 
 Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future period until we perform our obligations under these arrangements. Where applicable, amounts are recorded as unbilled revenue when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract with a customer has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the previously identified material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on November 9, 2023, we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to: (a) our general segregation of duties, including the review and approval of journal entries as well as system access that was not designed to allow for effective segregation of duties, which limits our ability to perform sufficient reviews and approve journal entries posted to the general ledger and to consistently execute review procedures over general ledger account reconciliations, financial statement preparation and accounting for vendor and payroll transactions; and (b) our accounting software system, which has certain system limitations, including limited user access controls and change management controls, which limits our ability to ensure appropriate authorization and segregation of duties when processing transactions. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are due to the fact that we have limited resources and do not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented coupled with the appropriate resources to oversee our business processes and controls. These material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. However, the deficiencies created a reasonable possibility that material misstatements to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management has analyzed the material weaknesses and performed additional analysis and procedures in preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We have concluded that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented. 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses 
 We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. Our planned remediation actions include the following: 
 Formalizing our internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our management; 

Adding additional accounting personnel and segregating duties among accounting personnel; and 

Implementing new applications and systems that focus on creating strong internal controls, including user access controls and defined approval processes for the posting of journal entries and recording of vendor invoices, payments of expenses, payroll processing and general ledger maintenance. 

41 

We are currently working to improve our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as described above, to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes, and, as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 42 

PART II OTHER IN FORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proc eedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to or aware of any legal proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and other legal proceedings can have a material adverse impact on us, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, in the case of intellectual property claims, requirements to change our product candidates, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors contained in the risks factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and the section titled Manag ement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and in our other public filings, in evaluating our business. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described in the above-mentioned risk factors could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
