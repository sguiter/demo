 and at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The Company made the policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses. Management estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience of the Company is paired with economic forecasts to provide the basis for the quantitatively modeled estimates of expected credit losses. The Company adjusts its quantitative model, as necessary, to reflect conditions not already considered by the quantitative model. These adjustments are commonly known as the qualitative factors. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company uses publicly available data, based on regulatory filings of larger banks, to derive initial proxy expected lifetime loss rates. Reasonable and supportable forecasts are incorporated into the development of these proxy loss rates, which generally revert back to historical and qualitative loss considerations after 12-24 months. The loss rates are adjusted, if necessary, based on management s assessment of certain criteria, including economic and business conditions, that may affect the Company s loan portfolio, to arrive at factors that best represent the estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a loan modification will be

 U.S. Government Agencies and State and Political Subdivisions Unrealized losses on these securities have not been recognized because the issuers bonds are of high credit quality, values have only been impacted by changes in interest rates since the securities were purchased, and the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach the maturity date. Because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality, and because the Company typically does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company determined that credit loss provisions were required. Mortgage-backed GSEs The unrealized losses on the Company s investment in residential mortgage-backed government sponsored enterprises were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality, and because the Company typically does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company determined that credit loss provisions were required.

The unpaid principal balances of these loans were approximately and at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

The main risks for these loans are changes in the value of the collateral and stability of the local economic environment and its impact on the borrowers employment. Management specifically considers unemployment and changes in real estate values in the Company s market area. Multi-family Real Estate These loans include loans on residential real estate secured by property with five or more units. The main risks are changes in the value of the collateral, ability of borrowers to collect rents, vacancy and changes in the tenants employment status.

Loans of sufficient quality, which generally are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the asset or underlying collateral. Special Mention. Loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Usually, this classification includes all 90 days or more, non-accrual, and past due loans. Doubtful. Loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates may not be realizable in an immediate settlement of the instrument. In some instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments, in which case fair values may be based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques, or based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristic of the financial instruments, or other factors. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimate of future cash flows. Subsequent changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates .

 shares of Monroe Federal Bancorp, Inc. common stock. The costs of issuing the common stock were deferred and deducted from the sales proceeds of the offering. The Company had incurred in deferred conversion costs as of September 30, 2024. At the completion of the conversion to stock form, the Company established a liquidation account in the amount of the Company s net worth reported in the Company s latest balance sheet contained in the final prospectus. The liquidation account will be maintained for the benefit of eligible savings account holders who maintain deposit accounts in the Company after conversion. The conversion will be accounted for as a change in corporate form with the historic basis of the Company s assets, liabilities and equity unchanged as a result. Monroe Federal Bancorp, Inc.is an emerging growth company, and, for as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, it may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies. Monroe Federal Bancorp, Inc. intends to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, its financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management s discussion and analysis is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The financial information in this section is derived from the accompanying unaudited financial statements. You should read the financial information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information contained in this report and in the Company s definitive prospectus dated August 9, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, which are worse than expected; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; our ability to maintain adequate liquidity, primarily through deposits; fluctuations in real estate values and in the conditions of the residential real estate and commercial real estate markets; demand for loans and deposits in our market area; our ability to implement and change our business strategies; competition among depository and other financial institutions; inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of our financial instruments, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments within our loan portfolio;

 adverse changes in the securities markets; changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; a failure or breach of our operational or information security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; our ability to retain key employees; and changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 
 Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, we assume no obligation and disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

 The following represent our critical accounting policies: Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for credit losses which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for credit losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated following the accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. ASC 326 replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology that reflects expected credit losses over the lives of the credit instruments and requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. ASC 326 requires an estimate of all expected credit losses for loans based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Before April 1, 2023, the analysis of the allowance for credit losses had two components, specific and general allowances. The specific percentage allowance was for unconfirmed losses related to loans that were determined to be impaired. Impairment was measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan was less than the loan s carrying value, a charge was recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which was for loans reviewed collectively, was determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyzed historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis established historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that were applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for credit losses necessary for loans that were reviewed collectively. The qualitative component was critical in determining the allowance for credit losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for credit losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for credit losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results. Deferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Determining the proper valuation allowance for deferred taxes is critical in properly valuing the deferred tax asset and the related recognition of income tax expense or benefit. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Fair Value Measurements . The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used

 for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 Total Assets. Total assets were 147.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7.4 million, or 4.8 , from March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily comprised of a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 8.6 million and a decrease in available for sale investment securities of 475,000, which were partially offset by an increase in net loans of 709,000. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 8.6 million, or 80.7 , to 2.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 10.6 million at March 31, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in deposits during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Investment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased 475,000, or 1.9 , to 24.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 25.2 million at March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to calls, maturities and repayments of securities totaling 1.3 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by a decrease in the level of unrealized losses on securities of 913,000. The improvement in the unrealized losses on securities was due to the 50 basis point decrease in the Federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve Board in September 2024. Net Loans. Net loans increased by 709,000, or 0.7 , to 108.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 107.9 million at March 31, 2024. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, loan originations totaled 7.4 million, comprised primarily of 3.8 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, 1.5 million of construction and land loans, 1.2 million home equity loans, 523,000 of commercial real estate loans and 180,000 of commercial and industrial loans. Consumer loan originations totaled 253,000, the majority of which were auto loans. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, residential real estate loans increased 1.3 million, or 1.8 , to a total of 70.4 million at September 30, 2024 and construction and land loans increased 899,000, or 29.1 , to 4.0 million at September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in multi-family loans of 394,000, or 20.7 , to 1.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease in commercial real estate loans of 339,000, or 1.4 , to 23.7 million at September 30, 2024 and a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of 461,000, or 9.4 , to 4.4 million at September 30, 2024. The Bank s overall loan growth has been achieved amid strong competition for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans in our market area. The Bank s strategy includes maintaining the loan portfolio, continuing to focus primarily on owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. Deposits. Deposits decreased by 17.7 million, or 12.5 , to 124.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 142.1 million at March 31, 2024. Core deposits decreased 9.7 million, or 9.7 , to 90.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 99.7 million at March 31, 2024. Certificates of deposit decreased 8.0 million, or 19.0 , to 34.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 42.4 million at March 31, 2024. The decrease in core deposits was due primarily to a 9.3 million decrease in the account held by a significant commercial customer whose account balances can tend to fluctuate routinely in the normal course of business. The decrease in certificates of deposit was due primarily to outflows of higher rate accounts as management elected not to compete on interest rates during the period. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, management continued its strategy of pursuing growth in demand accounts and other lower cost core deposits, in part by enhancing products and services offered and increased marketing. Management intends to continue its efforts to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on growth in consumer and business demand deposits.

 Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled 9.9 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.9 million, or 230.8 , from the 3.0 million balance at March 31, 2024. The additional borrowings were obtained primarily to fund deposit outflows during the period. Advances totaling 8.9 million are scheduled to mature within three months from September 30, 2024. Equity. Equity increased 519,000, or 6.1 , to 9.1 million at September 30, 2024, from 8.6 million at March 31, 2024. The increase was due primarily to a 721,000 decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was partially offset by the 202,000 net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Average Balances and Yields . The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and rates, and other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects are immaterial. Average balances are calculated using daily average balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. The average balance of available-for-sale securities does not include unrealized losses during the periods. Average yields include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Net deferred loan fees/costs are immaterial.

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. The Company reported a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 86,000, a decrease of 116,000 compared to net income of 30,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a 76,000 decrease in net interest income and a 72,000 increase in noninterest expenses, which were partially offset by an 8,000 increase in the recovery of credit losses and a 25,000 increase in the income tax benefit. Interest Income. Interest income increased 36,000, or 2.5 , to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to a 62,000, or 4.9 , increase in interest on loans receivable, which was partially offset by a 9,000, or 6.7 , decrease in interest on investment securities and a 17,000, or 41.5 , decrease in interest on interest-bearing deposits and other assets. The average yield on loans increased by 30 basis points to 4.79 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average balance of loans decreased by 1.9 million, or 1.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the average balance for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield on loans reflects the increase in the overall interest rate environment period-to-period. The increases in interest rates have provided higher yields on newly originated loans, as well as the Company s adjustable-rate loans, which have adjusted upward and should continue to rise provided the higher interest rate environment persists. The average balance of investment securities decreased 2.8 million, or 8.6 , to 29.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average yield on investment securities increased by four basis points to 1.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on other interest-bearing deposits, comprised primarily of overnight deposits and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, decreased 17,000, or 41.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a decrease in the average yield of 95 basis points, to 4.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a decrease in the average balance of 863,000, or 29.7 . Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 112,000, or 22.0 , to 620,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 508,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 87,000, or 22.8 , due primarily to an increase of 34 basis points in the average cost of deposits to 1.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by a decrease of 5.0 million, or 4.0 , in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 118.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 123.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on borrowings increased 25,000, or 19.7 , to 152,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 127,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a 1.4 million, or 14.3 , increase in the average balance outstanding, to 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 24 basis point increase in the weighted-average rate, to 5.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.17 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased 76,000, or 8.3 , to 844,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 920,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflected a decrease in the interest rate spread to 2.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average net interest earning assets decreased 2.1 million period-to-period. The net interest margin decreased to 2.38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate spread and net interest margin were impacted by a series of interest

 rate increases in the economy during 2023 and 2022 and to a lesser extent, a recent 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve Board. Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses. The Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of 15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 8,000 compared to a recovery of 7,000 recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 875,000 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 20,000, or 2.3 , over the 855,000 total at March 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments was 56,000 at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. The decrease in the overall allowance for credit losses was comprised of a 15,000 recovery of credit losses and 1,000 in loan recoveries during the period. The allowance for credit losses on loans represented 0.80 of total loans at September 30, 2024, and 0.79 at March 31, 2024. The determination over the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses included consideration of the balances of nonperforming loans, delinquent loans and net charge-offs in both periods. The Company s nonperforming loans totaled 237,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to nonperforming loans of 605,000 at September 30, 2023. Classified loans totaled 174,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 605,000 at September 30, 2023, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were 1.6 million and 783,000 at those respective dates. The allowance for credit losses reflects the estimate management believes to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 2023. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Noninterest Income . Noninterest income totaled 85,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2,000, or 2.0 , from 87,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable primarily to a 4,000, or 34.2 , decrease in other income, which was due primarily to a decrease in rental income, which was partially offset by a 3,000, or 11.7 , increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 72,000, or 7.2 , to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 992,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 67,000, or 13.8 , increase in salaries and employee benefits and a 5,000, or 4.1 , increase in data processing fees, which were partially offset by a 5,000, or 23.3 , decrease in advertising. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to an increase in staffing related to the new branch office and normal merit increases year-to-year. Noninterest expense can be expected to increase because of costs associated with operating as a public company and increased compensation costs related to possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. Income Taxes. The Company s income tax benefit provision increased by 25,000, or 291.8 , to a total of 34,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit provision of 9,000 the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the income tax benefit provision was due primarily to a 142,000 decrease in pretax income. The tax benefit provision and effective tax rates reflect the Company s nontaxable interest income in each period. Comparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. The Company reported a net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of 202,000, a decrease of 252,000 compared to net income of 50,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net

Table of Contents 
 income was primarily due to a 61,000 decrease in net interest income, a 24,000 increase in the provision for credit losses and a 223,000 increase in noninterest expenses, which were partially offset by and a 57,000 increase in the income tax benefit. Interest Income Interest income increased 127,000, or 4.5 , to 3.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to a 123,000, or 5.0 , increase in interest on loans receivable and a 26,000, or 30.2 , increase in interest on interest-bearing deposits and other assets, which were partially offset by a 22,000, or 8.1 , decrease in interest on investment securities. The average yield on loans increased by 30 basis points to 4.73 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.43 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, while the average balance of loans decreased by 1.9 million, or 1.7 , during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the average balance for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield on loans reflects the increase in the overall interest rate environment period-to-period. The increases in interest rates have provided higher yields on newly originated loans, as well as the Company s adjustable-rate loans, which have adjusted upward and should continue to rise provided the higher interest rate environment persists. The average balance of investment securities decreased 2.7 million to 30.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 32.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, while the average yield on investment securities increased by one basis point to 1.66 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.65 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on other interest-bearing deposits, comprised primarily of overnight deposits and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, increased 26,000, or 30.2 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in the average yield of 56 basis points, to 6.06 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.50 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in the average balance of 571,000, or 18.3 . The increase in average yield was due to the increase in interest rates in the overall economy period-to-period. Interest Expense Total interest expense increased 188,000, or 20.0 , to 1.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 939,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 232,000, or 33.0 , due primarily to an increase of 38 basis points in the average cost of deposits to 1.52 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.14 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by a decrease of 534,000, or 0.4 , in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 122.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 123.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on borrowings decreased 44,000, or 18.6 , to 193,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 237,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 2.3 million, or 23.4 , decrease in the average balance outstanding, to 7.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was partially offset by a 33 basis point increase in the weighted-average rate, to 5.20 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.89 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased 61,000, or 3.2 , to 1.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease reflected a decrease in the interest rate spread to 2.39 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.42 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, while the average net interest earning assets decreased 1.3 million period-to-period. The net interest margin decreased to 2.55 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.56 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate spread and net interest margin were impacted by a series of interest rate increases in the economy during 2023 and 2022, and to a lesser extent, a recent 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve Board. Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses totaled 17,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a recovery recorded for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The allowance for 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 credit losses on loans was 875,000 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 20,000, or 2.3 , over the 855,000 total at March 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments was 56,000 at both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. The increase in the overall allowance for credit losses was comprised of a 17,000 recovery of credit losses and 2,000 in loan recoveries during the period. The allowance for credit losses on loans represented 0.80 of total loans at September 30, 2024, and 0.79 at March 31, 2024. The determination over the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses included consideration of the balances of nonperforming loans, delinquent loans and net charge-offs in both periods. The Company s nonperforming loans totaled 237,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to nonperforming loans of 605,000 at September 30, 2023. Classified loans totaled 174,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 605,000 at September 30, 2023, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were 1.6 million and 783,000 at those respective dates. The allowance for credit losses reflects the estimate management believes to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and 2023. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Non-Interest Income . Noninterest income totaled 173,000 for both the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A 7,000, or 31.4 , decrease in other income, due primarily to a decrease in rental income, was partially offset by a 6,000, or 12.0 , increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 223,000, or 11.0 , to 2.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 133,000, or 164.2 , increase in professional fees, a 94,000, or 9.3 , increase in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in professional services expense was due primarily to an increase in audit fees as the Company s financial statements were reaudited in connection with the planned mutual-to-stock conversion transaction. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to an increase in staffing related to the new branch office and normal merit increases year-to-year. Noninterest expense can be expected to increase because of costs associated with operating as a public company and increased compensation costs related to possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxe s. The Company s income tax benefit provision increased by 57,000, or 283.1 , to a total of 77,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit provision of 20,000 the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the income tax benefit provision was due primarily to a 308,000 decrease in pretax income. The tax benefit provision and effective tax rates reflect the Company s nontaxable interest income in each period. Management of Market Risk General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The board of directors establishes policies and guidelines for managing interest rate risk. All directors participate in discussions during the regular board meetings evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, and the level of risk that is appropriate. These discussions take into consideration our business

 strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by them. The board of directors delegates the responsibility for interest rate risk management to the asset/liability management committee consisting of the Company s executive officers. The asset/liability management committee provides quarterly reports to the board of directors. If an exception to the interest rate risk policy tolerance limits arise, the asset/liability management committee documents and communicates it to the board of directors at its next scheduled meeting along with a recommended course of action to address the exception consistent with established policy and guidelines. Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we are using to manage interest rate risk are: maintaining capital levels that exceed the thresholds for well-capitalized status under federal regulations; maintaining a high level of liquidity; growing our core deposit accounts; managing our investment securities portfolio so as to reduce the average maturity and effective life of the portfolio; and continuing to diversify our loan portfolio by adding more commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, which typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments. By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates. 
 We maintain a significant deposit account with a commercial customer. The asset/liability management committee monitors the status of the account at its monthly meeting and the account is segregated as a separate line item on the deposit reports reviewed by the committee. Furthermore, there is regular verbal communication between senior management and the depositor regarding any expected changes in the depositor s business that could result in material inflows and outflow from the account in the short-term so that we may proactively manage any risks due to expected fluctuations in the account balance. We maintain uninsured deposits that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. Senior management reviews uninsured deposit balances monthly to manage any risks due to fluctuations in the balances of uninsured deposits. We do not maintain any internal policy limits on concentrations in uninsured deposits in total or by type of depositor. We may accept brokered deposits up to an internal policy limit of 15 of total assets from brokers approved by the board of directors. Before a broker is approved by the board of directors, we conduct financial analysis and due diligence on the broker. We had no brokered deposits at June 30, 2024. Historically, we have not sold loans we have originated. Following the conversion and stock offering, we plan to develop the infrastructure necessary to sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly longer term one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to further help mitigate our interest rate risk exposure. We have not engaged in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options. We do not anticipate entering into similar transactions in the future. Economic Value of Equity. We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance

 sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by 100, 200 and 300 basis point increments or decreases instantaneously by 100, 200 and 300 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. The estimated changes presented in the table are within the policy limits established by our board of directors except that the decrease in EVE at the positive 200 and 300 basis point levels exceeded policy limits.

(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. 
 The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, we would have experienced a 24.2 decrease in EVE in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 7.3 increase in EVE in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates. Change in Net Interest Income. The table sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

 The table above indicates that as of September 30, 2024, we would have experienced a 1.2 decrease in net interest income in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 3.1 decrease in net interest income in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rate. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE and NII require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For instance, the EVE and NII tables presented above assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. However, the shape of the yield curve changes constantly and the value and pricing of our assets and liabilities, including our deposits, may not closely correlate with changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE and NII tables may provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time and in the context of a particular yield curve, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and NII and will differ from actual results. EVE and net interest NII calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a correspondent bank. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to 35.7 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati under a collateral pledge facility. At September 30, 2024, we had 9.9 million of outstanding advances under this facility. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland but had the capacity to borrow up to 7.4 million. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings from the correspondent bank but had the capacity to borrow up to 4.3 million. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 8.6 million. Net cash used in providing by investing activities amounted to 185,000, net cash used in financing activities amounted to 7.7 million, and net cash used in operating activities amounted to 1.0 million. We believe we maintain a strong liquidity position, and are committed to maintaining it. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. At September 30, 2024, the Company was categorized as well-capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category. For further information, see note 6 to the notes to financial statements.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2024, we had 15.7 million of outstanding commitments, consisting of 1.9 million in commitments to originate loans and 13.8 million of undisbursed funds on previously originated loans. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature on or before September 30, 2025, totaled 25.1 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information in Item 2 under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management of Market Risk is incorporated in this Item 3 by reference. Item 4. Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
