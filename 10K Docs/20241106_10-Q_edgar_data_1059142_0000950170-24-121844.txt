Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report (including, but not limited to, the information contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used, statements which are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as anticipate, estimate, should, expect, believe, intend, and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This report also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other industry data. This data involves several assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties contained in this report, and accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described under the heading Risk Factors in Item 1A of Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 These forward-looking statements are subject, but not limited to various risks and uncertainties, including those relating to: 
 defaults on the mortgage loans securing our MRBs and GILs; 

the competitive environment in which we operate; 

risks associated with investing in multifamily, student, senior citizen residential properties and commercial properties; 

general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions, including the current and future impact of changing interest rates, inflation, and international conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war) on business operations, employment, and financial conditions; 

uncertain conditions within the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, including monetary and fiscal policy and conditions in the investment, credit, interest rate, and derivatives markets; 

adverse reactions in U.S. financial markets related to actions of foreign central banks or the economic performance of foreign economies, including in particular China, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom; 

the general condition of the real estate markets in the regions in which we operate, which may be unfavorably impacted by pressures in the commercial real estate sector, incrementally higher unemployment rates, persistent elevated inflation levels, and other factors; 

changes in interest rates and credit spreads, as well as the success of any hedging strategies we may undertake in relation to such changes, and the effect such changes may have on the relative spreads between the yield on our investments and our cost of financing; 

the aggregate effect of elevated inflation levels over the past several years, spurred by multiple factors including expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, higher commodity prices, a tight labor market, and low residential vacancy rates, which may result in continued elevated interest rate levels and increased market volatility; 

our ability to access debt and equity capital to finance our assets; 

current maturities of our financing arrangements and our ability to renew or refinance such financing arrangements; 

local, regional, national, and international economic and credit market conditions; 

recapture of previously issued LIHTCs in accordance with Section 42 of the IRC; 

geographic concentration of properties related to our investments; and 

changes in the U.S. corporate tax code and other government regulations affecting our business. 

Other risks, uncertainties and factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. 

All references to we, us, our and the Partnership in this report mean Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP, its wholly owned subsidiaries and our consolidated VIEs. See Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report for additional details.

 series of non-cumulative, non-voting, non-convertible preferred units that represent limited partnership interests in the Partnership consisting of the Series A Preferred Units, the Series A-1 Preferred Units, and the Series B Preferred Units. The outstanding Preferred Units are redeemable in the future at the option of either the holders or the Partnership (Note 17). On December 5, 2022, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two , in its capacity as the General Partner of the Partnership, and Greystone ILP, Inc., in its capacity as the initial limited partner of the Partnership, entered into the Partnership Agreement. Mortgage investments, as defined in the Partnership Agreement, consist of MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans. The Partnership Agreement authorizes the Partnership to make investments in tax-exempt securities other than mortgage investments provided that the tax-exempt investments are rated in of the highest rating categories by a national securities rating agency. The Partnership Agreement also allows the Partnership to invest in other securities whose interest may be taxable for federal income tax purposes. Total tax-exempt investments and other investments cannot exceed of the Partnership's total assets at the time of acquisition as required under the Partnership Agreement. Tax-exempt investments and other investments primarily consist of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated entities. In addition, the amount of other investments is limited based on the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership. Greystone Manager, the general partner of the General Partner, is an affiliate of Greystone. All disclosures of the number of rental units for properties related to MRBs, GILs, property loans and MF Properties are unaudited.

basis points in response to current employment, price and economic data, including indications of declining year-over-year inflation rates directionally toward the Federal Reserve s long-term annual inflation target of . In addition, geopolitical conflicts continue to impact the general global economic environment. These factors have maintained volatility in the fixed income markets, which has impacted the value of some of the Partnership s investment assets, particularly those with fixed interest rates, which may result in collateral posting requirements under our debt financing arrangements. In addition, changes in short-term interest rates will directly impact the interest cost associated with the Partnership s variable rate debt financing arrangements and for construction debt of properties underlying our investments in unconsolidated entities. The extent to which general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions will impact the Partnership s financial condition or results of operations in the future is uncertain and actual results and outcomes could differ from current estimates. The aggregate effects of the recent inflationary environment experienced in the United States may continue to adversely impact operating expenses at properties securing the Partnership s inve stments and general operations, which may reduce net operating results of the related properties and result in lower debt service coverage or higher than anticipated capitalized interest requirements for properties under construction. Such occurrences may negatively impact the value of the Partnership s investments. Continuing elevated levels of general and administrative expenses of the Partnership may adversely affect the Partnership s operating results, including a reduction in net income.

and non-consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table summarizes the Partnership s carrying value by asset and maximum exposure to loss associated with the variable interests as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

Mortgage revenue bonds 

Taxable mortgage revenue bonds (reported within other assets) 

Governmental issuer loans held in trust 

Taxable governmental issuer loans (reported within other assets) 

Property loans 

Investments in unconsolidated entities 

The Partnership s maximum exposure to loss for non-consolidated VIEs associated with the MRBs and taxable MRBs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is equal to the Partnership s cost basis adjusted for paydowns. The difference between the carrying values in the Partnership's condensed consolidated balance sheets and the maximum exposure to loss is due to the unrealized gains or losses. The Partnership has future MRB and taxable MRB funding commitments related to non-consolidated VIEs totaling million and million , respectively, as of September 30, 2024 (Note 16). The Partnership s maximum exposure to loss for non-consolidated VIEs associated with GILs, taxable GILs, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is equal to the Partnership s carrying value. The Partnership has future GIL, taxable GIL, property loan and investment in unconsolidated entities funding commitments related to non-consolidated VIEs totaling million , million , million , and million , respectively, as of September 30, 2024 (Note 16). Consolidated Variable Interest Entities The Partnership obtains leverage on its investment assets to enhance returns and lower its net capital investment. The Partnership s leverage programs generally consist of selling MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs, and property loans into debt financing entities in the form of TOBs, a term TOB, TEBS financings, and the TEBS Residual Financing. These debt financing entities issue senior securities and residual beneficial interests that share in the cash flows from the securitized investment assets. The senior securities are sold to third-party investors for cash and the Partnership retains the residual beneficial interests. The Partnership determined that its residual beneficial interest in a debt financing entity absorbs potential losses of the entity as the interests are in a first-loss position and subordinate to the senior securities in the distribution of cash flows of the debt financing entity. The Partnership has determined that each debt financing entity is a VIE for financial reporting purposes and the Partnership performs an evaluation to determine if the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In determining the primary beneficiary of each VIE, the Partnership considered which party has the power to control the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact its financial performance and the obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Partnership determined that the right to direct the VIE to sell the underlying assets most significantly impacts the economic performance of the VIE, and such right

million as of September 30, 2024. The MRB and the unfunded MRB commitment are accounted for as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value. The reported unrealized loss includes the unrealized loss on the current MRB carrying value (based on current fair value) as well as the unrealized loss on the Partnership s remaining funding commitment outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (also based on current fair value). The Partnership determined the unrealized loss is a result of increasing market interest rates and that the cumulative unrealized loss is not considered a credit loss. As of September 30, 2024, the MRB has been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months.

million as a reduction to Partners Capital, or approximately of the Partnerships carrying value of GILs, taxable GILs and property loans and total unfunded commitments. This amount does not include the Live 929 Apartments property loan that had a previous asset-specific allowance of . The Partnership recorded a recovery of provision for credit losses of approximately and approximately for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions, a decrease in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the Partnership s model to estimate the allowance for credit losses. The Partnership recorded a recovery of provision for credit losses of approximately and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions, a decrease in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the Partnership s model to estimate the allowance for credit losses. Risk Ratings The Partnership evaluates all GILs, taxable GILs and property loans on a quarterly basis and assigns a risk rating based upon management s assessment of the borrower s ability to pay debt service and the likelihood of repayment through the GIL s conversion to Freddie Mac financing and the property loan s payment from future equity contribution commitments. The assessment is subjective and based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, construction status of the property, financial strength of borrowers and guarantors, adequacy of capitalized interest reserves, lease up and occupancy of the property, the status of other conversion conditions, and operating results of the underlying property. The credit risk analysis and rating assignment is performed quarterly in conjunction with the Partnership s assessment of its allowance for credit losses. The Partnership uses the following definitions for its risk ratings: Performing The underlying property currently meets or exceeds management s performance expectations and metrics. There are currently no material indicators that current debt service or repayment of the GILs and property loans is at risk. 

 Watch The underlying property associated with the GILs and property loans currently has certain performance or other risk factors that require specific attention from management. The Partnership could experience loss if these factors are not resolved in a timely or satisfactory manner. The Partnership currently estimates that such factors will be adequately resolved and that current debt service and final repayment of the GILs and property loans is not at material risk. 

 Nonperforming The underlying property associated with the GILs and property loans is not current on debt service payments and/or has material performance or other risk factors. The Partnership currently believes that full collection of debt service and final repayment is questionable and/or improbable.

million and million of cash collateral with Mizuho as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was required cash collateral posted with Barclays as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Partnership posted restricted cash as contractually required under the terms of the three TEBS financings. In addition, the Partnership has entered into an interest rate cap agreement to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable-rate M31 TEBS financing (Note 15). The Term TOB trust financing with Morgan Stanley is subject to a Trust Agreement and other related agreements that contain covenants with which the Partnership or the underlying MRB are required to comply. The underlying property must maintain certain occupancy and debt service covenants. A termination event will occur if the Partnership s net assets, as defined, decrease by in one quarter or over one year. The covenants also require the Partnership s partners capital, as defined, to maintain a certain threshold and that the Partnership remain listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange. If the underlying property or the Partnership, as applicable, is out of compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facility would be triggered. The Partnership was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024. The Term TOB trust financing terminated and repaid in full in (see Note 25). The Partnership s variable rate debt financing arrangements include maximum interest rate provisions that prevent the debt service on the debt financings from exceeding the cash flows from the underlying securitized assets.

Greens of Pine Glen, LP 

In December 2022, the Partnership sold of its ownership interest in The 50/50 MF Property to an unrelated non-profit organization. The buyer assumed two mortgages payable associated with the property and the Partnership agreed to provide certain recourse support for the assumed mortgages. The TIF Loan was paid off in June 2024, and the Partnership does not have exposure as of September 30, 2024. The mortgage support is in the form of a forward loan purchase agreement upon maturity of the mortgage. The reported value of the credit guaranties was approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included within other liabilities in the Partnership's condensed consolidated balance sheets. No additional contingent liability has been accrued because the likelihood of claims is remote. The Partnership's remaining forward loan purchase agreement expires in and its maximum exposure as of September 30, 2024 was approximately million . The Partnership has entered into various forward loan purchase agreements associated with construction loans for its investments in unconsolidated entities. Under these agreements, the Partnership will purchase a loan from the construction lender at maturity of the construction loan, which is typically five to from closing, if not otherwise repaid by the borrower entity. The Partnership has the right to cure any defaults under the construction loan agreement that otherwise could accelerate the maturity of the construction loan. In addition, if the Partnership is required to perform under a forward loan purchase agreement, then it has the right to remove the managing member of the borrower entity, take ownership of the underlying property, and either sell the property or obtain replacement financing. Certain forward loan purchase agreements are only effective upon the receipt by the property of a certificate of occupancy by the borrower entity while others are effective as of the construction loan closing. The Partnership has recourse to the managing member of the borrower entity and/or the project s general contractor for those agreements that are effective prior to the receipt of a certificate of occupancy. Total construction loan balances associated with effective forward loan purchase agreements are million as of September 30, 2024. The Partnership has not recorded any non-contingent or contingent liabilities related to the forward loan purchase agreements as such amounts are deemed minimal.

RUAs have historically been granted with vesting conditions ranging from to up to . Unvested RUAs are typically entitled to receive distributions during the restriction period. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of the RUAs if there is a change in control related to the Partnership, the General Partner, or the general partner of the General Partner, or upon death or disability of the Plan participant. The fair value of each RUA is estimated on the grant date based on the Partnership s exchange-listed closing price of the BUCs. The Partnership recognizes compensation expense for the RUAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period. The compensation expense for RUAs totaled approximately and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Derivative Instruments The effect of the Partnership s interest rate swap agreements is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement. The Partnership uses a third-party pricing service that incorporates commonly used market pricing methods to value the interest rate swaps. The fair value is based on a model that considers observable indices and observable market trades for similar arrangements and therefore the interest rate swaps are categorized as Level 2 assets or liabilities. The effect of the Partnership s interest rate cap is to set a cap, or upper limit, subject to performance of the counterparty, on the base rate of interest paid on the Partnership s variable rate debt financings equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement. The Partnership uses a third-party pricing service to value the interest rate cap. The inputs into the interest rate cap agreements valuation model include SOFR rates, unobservable adjustments to account for the SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms. The fair value is based on a model with inputs that are not observable and therefore the interest rate cap is categorized as a Level 3 asset. The effect of the Partnership s total return swap was to lower the net interest rate related to the Partnership s Secured Notes equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement. The Partnership used a third-party pricing service to value the total return swap position and the inputs in the total return swap valuation model include changes in the value of the Secured Notes and the associated changes in value of the underlying assets securing the Secured Notes, accrued and unpaid interest, and any potential gain share amounts. The fair value was based on a model with inputs that are not observable and therefore the total return swaps were categorized as Level 3 assets or liabilities.

Total gains and losses included in earnings for the derivative instruments are reported within Net result from derivative transactions in the Partnership's condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Partnership utilized a third-party pricing service to determine the fair value of the Partnership s GILs, taxable GILs, and construction financing property loans that share a first mortgage lien with the GILs, which is an estimate of their market price. The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The valuation methodology considers the underlying characteristics of the GILs and property loans as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, the progress of construction and operations of the underlying properties, and the financial capacity of guarantors. The valuation methodology also considers the probability that conditions for the execution of forward commitments to purchase the GILs will be met. Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurements of the Partnership s GILs, taxable GIL, and construction financing property loans are categorized as Level 3 assets. The estimated fair value of the GILs and taxable GILs was million and million as of September 30, 2024, respectively. The estimated fair value of the GILs and taxable GILs was million and million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the construction financing property loans approximated amortized cost as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Partnership utilized a third-party pricing service to determine the fair value of the Partnership s financial liabilities, which are estimates of market prices.

million. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership is the Construction Lending JV s managing member responsible for identifying, evaluating, underwriting, and closing investments, subject to the conditions of the joint venture and third-party investor evaluation and approval. The Partnership will earn proportionate returns on its invested capital plus promote income if the joint venture meets certain earnings thresholds. The Partnership expects to account for its investment in the Construction Lending JV using the equity method. In October 2024, the Partnership terminated the M31 TEBS Financing and paid all principal and accrued interest due on the M31 Class A TEBS Certificates. Upon termination, five of the remaining MRBs that had been securitized in the facility were transferred into TOB facilities, and six MRBs were transferred to a counterparty related to a short-term financing facility while alternative financing is being arranged. In October 2024, the Partnership entered into new TOB trust financings for of the MRBs that were previously in the M31 TEBS Financing.

In October 2024, the Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiary, ATAX TEBS II, LLC, entered into various agreements relating to a new long-term financing facility (the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction through the securitization of partial interests in mortgage revenue bonds (the 2024 PFA Securitization Bonds with total outstanding principal of million. A municipal conduit issuer (the Public Finance Authority of Wisconsin) and a trustee created the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction, into which the Partnership then sold custodial receipts representing partial interests in the 2024 PFA Securitization Bonds. The municipal conduit issuer then issued Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates in the stated amount of approximately million, which were sold to unaffiliated investors. For financial reporting purposes, the Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates of the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction are considered debt financing of the Partnership. Debt service on the Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates is payable from the cash flows due on the custodial receipts for the 2024 PFA Securitization Bonds. The holders of the Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates are entitled to interest at a fixed rate of per annum, payable monthly, and all principal payments from the 2024 PFA Securitization Bonds until the stated amount of the Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates is reduced to zero, which will be no later than September 2039. The Partnership will also pay credit enhancement, servicing, and trustee fees related to the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction totaling per annum. The Partnership retained the residual interests in the 2024 PFA Securitization Bonds and is evaluating financing options for such residual interests. The Partnership received net proceeds of approximately million, after payment of placement, legal and other related costs. Approximately million of the net proceeds was used to repay the Partnership s temporary bridge financing provided by a lender from the period between the M31 TEBS Financing termination and closing of the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction. In October 2024, the Partnership repaid various debt financings to allow for closing of the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 In this Management s Discussion and Analysis, all references to we, us, and the Partnership refer to Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP, its consolidated subsidiaries, and consolidated VIEs for all periods presented. The Partnership includes the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Partnership, our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. All significant transactions and accounts between us and the consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation. See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements for further disclosures. 
 Executive Summary 
 The Partnership was formed in 1998 for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds MRBs that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors housing and commercial properties. We also invest in governmental issuer loans GILs, which are similar to MRBs, to provide construction financing for affordable multifamily and seniors housing properties. We expect and believe the interest received on these MRBs and GILs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We also invest in other types of securities and investments that may or may not be secured by real estate and may make property loans to multifamily properties which may or may not be financed by MRBs or GILs held by us and may or may not be secured by real estate. 
 We also make JV Equity Investments for the construction, stabilization, and ultimate sale of market-rate multifamily and seniors housing properties. We are entitled to distributions if, and when, cash is available for distribution either through operations, a refinance or sale of the property. In addition, the Partnership may acquire and hold interests in multifamily, student or senior citizen residential MF Properties. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had four reportable segments: (1) Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments, (2) Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments, (3) Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments and (4) MF Properties. We separately report our consolidation and elimination information because we do not allocate certain items to the segments. All General and administrative expenses on the Partnership's condensed consolidated statements of operations are reported within the Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments segment. See Notes 2 and 24 to the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. The following table presents summary information regarding activity of our segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income was significantly impacted by unrealized losses on our derivative instrument portfolio, which primarily consists of interest rate swaps. Under the applicable accounting guidance, we report our derivatives at fair value as of each reporting date. The fair value is based on a model that considers observable indices and observable market trades for similar arrangements, such as publicly available current SOFR rates and forward SOFR swap rates. The period-over-period change in the fair value of each derivative that is not directly related to net cash settlements are recorded as unrealized (gains) losses within Net result from derivative transactions on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and is included as a component of our reported net income. Unrealized (gains) losses can be significant in periods of significant interest rate volatility, such as the third quarter of 2024. 
 We recorded significant unrealized losses from derivatives of 9.7 million and 4.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and significant unrealized gains of 4.2 million and 6.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to market interest rate changes between reporting dates. The 3-year SOFR swap rate is a reasonable proxy for our interest rate swap portfolio as a whole as our derivatives are primarily SOFR-denominated interest rate swaps and the weighted average life of our interest rate swap portfolio is typically between three and four years. The 3-year SOFR swap rate declined 1.04 from 4.35 as of June 30, 2024 to 3.31 as of September 30, 2024, resulting in a significant unrealized loss on our interest rate swap portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The 3-year SOFR swap rate declined 0.44 from 3.75 as of December 31, 2023 to 3.31 as of September 30, 2024, resulting in a significant unrealized loss on our interest rate swap portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

(6,821) 

Though unrealized (gains) losses may impact our reported net income period-to-period, the net cash settlements on our interest rate swaps are less variable. Our interest rate swaps are designed such that changes in the monthly net cash settlements will offset the changes in monthly interest costs on our variable-rate debt financings. Our interest rate swaps are subject to monthly net cash settlements whereby we pay a stated fixed rate and our counterparty pays a variable rate equal to the compounded SOFR rate for the settlement period. If short-term interest rates decline, the interest cost of our variable-rate debt financings will typically decline. Meanwhile, the variable rate payment by the counterparty on our interest rate swap will decline such that our benefit from the monthly net settlement payment will decline . The change in interest cost on our variable-rate debt financing generally offsets the reduced monthly net cash settlement payments associated with the related interest rate swap, such that our net cash flow for the period is not materially impacted by changes in short term interest rate changes. For this reason, we adjust net income for unrealized losses on our derivative instruments when calculating CAD, a non-GAAP performance measure discussed later in this Item 2, which we consider to be a useful measure of our operating performance.

Corporate Responsibility 
 We are committed to corporate responsibility and the importance of developing environmental, social, and governance policies and practices consistent with that commitment. We believe the implementation and maintenance of such policies and practices benefit the employees that serve the Partnership, support long-term performance for our Unitholders, and have a positive impact on society and the environment. 
 64 

Environmental Responsibility 
 Achieving positive environmental and sustainability impacts in connection with our affordable housing investment activity is important to us. Opportunities for positive environmental investments are open to us because private activity bond volume cap and LIHTC allocations are key components of the capital structure for most new construction or acquisition/rehabilitation affordable housing properties financed by our MRB and GIL investments. These resources are allocated by individual states to our property sponsors through a competitive application process under a state-specific QAP as required under Section 42 of the IRC. Each state implements its public policy objectives through an application scoring or ranking system that rewards certain property features. Some of the common features rewarded under individual state QAPs are transit amenities (proximity to various forms of public transportation), proximity to public services (parks, libraries, full scale supermarkets, or a senior center), and energy efficiency/sustainability. Some state-specific QAPs have minimum energy efficiency standards that must be met, such as the use of low water need landscaping, Energy Star appliances and hot water heaters, and GREENGUARD Gold certified insulation. Since we can only finance properties with successful applications, we work with our sponsor clients to maximize these environmental features such that their applications can earn the most points possible under the individual state s QAP. The following table summarizes total funding commitments related to properties that were awarded both private activity bond cap and LIHTC allocations through state-specific QAPs:

In 2021, we acquired an MRB investment secured by Meadow Valley, a to-be-constructed 174-bed seniors housing facility in Traverse City, MI. Part of the construction financing is provided through a C-PACE program, which is a state policy-enabled financing mechanism that allows developers to access the capital needed to make renewable energy accessible and cost-effective. In the case of Meadow Valley, C-PACE financing of 24.8 million will be provided to finance energy conservation features including high efficiency windows, roof, walls, heating, cooling, indoor and outdoor lighting, water heating and low-flow fixtures. The C-PACE financing is repaid through a property tax assessment over the life of the property. Many lenders are averse to financing properties with C-PACE financing as the tax assessment is a senior obligation of the property. We have developed underwriting procedures that allow for the borrower to obtain C-PACE financing and still meet our security and underwriting requirements. We will continue to evaluate investment opportunities related to properties that utilize C-PACE financing for future investment as we want to encourage our borrowers to utilize clean energy design and construction practices. 
 We are committed to minimizing the overall environmental impact of our corporate operations. The Partnership s operations are primarily managed by 16 employees of Greystone Manager, so we have a relatively modest environmental impact and have adequate facilities to grow our employee base without acquiring additional physical space. 
 Social Responsibility 
 Our MRB and GIL investments directly support the construction, rehabilitation, and stabilized operation of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable multifamily housing across the United States. The development of affordable multifamily housing has relatively broad legislative support at the federal and state levels. Each of the properties securing our MRB and GIL investments is required to maintain a minimum percentage of units set aside for a combination of very low-income (50 or less of AMI) and low-income (80 or less of AMI) tenants in accordance with IRC guidelines, and the owners of the properties often agree to exceed the minimum IRC requirements. The rent charged to income qualified tenants at MRB or GIL properties is often restricted to a certain percentage of the tenants income, making them more affordable. For any new MRB or GIL investments associated with a low-income housing tax credit property, restrictions regarding tenant incomes and rents charged to those low-income households are required. In addition, certain borrowers related to our MRB investments are non-profit entities that provide affordable multifamily housing consistent with their charitable purposes. These properties provide valuable housing and support services to both low-income and market-rate tenants and create housing diversity in the geographic and social communities in which they are located.

One of our Managers is a member of our investment committee that pre-approves all new investments. We regularly monitor and assess risks to achieving our business objectives and such risk assessments are discussed with both the Audit Committee and the full Board of Managers at regularly held meetings and in regular informal discussions. The Audit Committee and Board of Managers have had 100 attendance during 2023 and to date in 2024.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining (i) the fair value of MRBs and taxable MRBs; (ii) investment impairments; and (iii) allowance for credit losses. 
 The Partnership s critical accounting estimates are the same as those described in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments Segment 
 The Partnership s primary purpose is to acquire and hold as investments a portfolio of MRBs which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for residential properties and commercial properties in their market areas. We have also invested in taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans which are included within this segment. All General and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statements of operations are reported within this segment. 
 Our MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and certain property loans are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust. Property loans related to multifamily properties are also included in this segment and may or may not be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust. 
 We expect to report the Partnership s proportionate share of earnings from our Construction Lending JV within this segment once it has reportable activities.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of approximately 2.0 million in other interest income from lower average property loan, taxable MRB and taxable GIL investment balances of approximately 91.4 million. 

A decrease of approximately 1.8 million in interest income due to recent GIL redemptions, offset by an increase of approximately 789,000 in interest income from recent GIL investments and higher average interest rates; 

A decrease of approximately 574,000 in other interest income due to decreasing interest earned on cash balances; 

An increase of approximately 2.4 million in interest income from recent MRB advances, offset by a decrease of approximately 526,000 in interest income due to MRB redemptions and principal repayments; 

An increase of approximately 1.1 million in interest income due to discount accretion on the Southpark MRB upon redemption at par in July 2024; and 

An increase of approximately 172,000 in other income for receipt of non-refundable fees for the extension of various GILs and property loans. 

67 

Interest expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of approximately 2.9 million due to a decrease in the average outstanding principal of our debt financing instruments of approximately 70.1 million; and 

A decrease of approximately 201,000 due to lower average interest rates on our debt financings. 

The net result from derivative transactions consists of realized and unrealized (gains) losses from our derivative financial instruments. Realized (gains) losses represent receipts or payments related to our interest rate swaps during the period. Unrealized (gains) losses are generally a result of changes in current and forward interest rates during the period. Increasing interest rates generally result in unrealized gains while decreasing interest rates generally result in unrealized losses. The following table summarizes the components of this line item for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Unrealized losses on derivatives, net, were approximately 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of approximately 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increased losses of approximately 11.7 million between the two periods. The increase in the unrealized losses was attributable to declining current and forward market interest rates which caused the fair value of our derivatives to decline. If the reference rates on our interest rate swaps continue to fall in the future, then we will likely experience additional unrealized losses on derivatives, net. See the Executive Summary section of this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to declining expected credit losses for our portfolio of GIL, taxable GIL and property loan investments. The decreases were primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions during 2023 and 2024, decreases in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the model used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. 
 Segment net income decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to: 
 The changes in line items detailed above; and 

A decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due to a decrease of approximately 245,000 in employee compensation and benefits.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenues decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of approximately 7.0 million in interest income due to recent GIL redemptions, offset by an increase of approximately 3.3 million in interest income from recent GIL investments and higher average interest rates; 

A decrease of approximately 6.0 million in other interest income from lower average property loan, taxable MRB and taxable GIL investment balances of approximately 95.4 million. 

A decrease of approximately 602,000 in other interest income due to decreasing interest earned on cash balances; 

An increase of approximately 5.4 million in interest income from recent MRB advances, offset by a decrease of approximately 1.3 million in interest income due to MRB redemptions and principal repayments; 

An increase of approximately 1.1 million in interest income due to discount accretion on the Southpark MRB upon redemption at par in July 2024; and 

An increase of approximately 205,000 in other income for receipt of non-refundable fees for the extension of various GILs and property loans. 

Interest expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to: 
 A decrease of approximately 11.3 million due to a decrease in the average outstanding principal of our debt financing instruments of approximately 134.2 million; 

A decrease of approximately 491,000 in amortization of deferred financing costs; and 

An increase of approximately 1.6 million due to higher average interest rates on debt financing. 

The net result from derivative transactions consists of realized and unrealized (gains) losses from our derivative financial instruments. Realized (gains) losses represent receipts or payments related to our interest rate swaps during the period. Unrealized (gains) losses are generally a result of changes in current and forward interest rates during the period. Increasing interest rates generally result 
 70 

in unrealized gains while decreasing interest rates generally result in unrealized losses. The following table summarizes the components of this line item for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Unrealized losses on derivatives, net, were approximately 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of approximately 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increased losses of approximately 10.0 million between the two periods. The increase in the unrealized losses was attributable to declining current and forward market interest rates which caused the fair value of our derivatives to decline. If the reference rate on our interest rate swaps continue to fall in the future, then we will likely experience additional unrealized losses on derivatives, net. See the Executive Summary section of this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to declining expected credit losses for our portfolio of GIL, taxable GIL and property loan investments. The decreases were primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions during 2023 and 2024, decreases in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the model used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a recovery of our previously recorded allowance for credit loss for the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in the amount of approximately 169,000 due to receipt of final bankruptcy proceeds that exceeded prior estimates. 
 The gain on sale of mortgage revenue bond for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the sale of the Brookstone MRB in May 2024. There was no gain on sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Segment net income decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to: 
 The changes in line items detailed above; and 

A decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due to decreases of approximately 194,000 in administration fees paid to the General Partner due to lower assets under management, and approximately 429,000 in employee compensation and benefits.

Operational Matters 
 The multifamily properties securing our MRBs were all current on contractual debt service payments on our MRBs and we have received no requests for forbearance of contractual debt service payments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our sole student housing property securing an MRB, Live 929 Apartments, was 90 occupied as of September 30, 2024, and is current on MRB debt service. Current occupancy is much improved from the September 2023 through May 2024 academic term. The property leases exclusively to students, personnel and other tenants associated with the nearby Johns Hopkins University medical campus. The property is expected to be able to pay all operating expenses and debt service from operating cash flows for the 2024-2025 school year. 
 Construction and rehabilitation activities continue at properties securing our GILs, taxable GILs and related property loans. Four of the seven underlying affordable multifamily properties had commenced leasing operations as of September 30, 2024. To date, these properties have not experienced any material supply chain disruptions for either construction materials or labor. 
 We have four MRBs, one taxable MRB, and four GILs that have variable interest rates as of September 30, 2024. All such investments finance the construction of affordable multifamily properties. We regularly monitor interest costs in comparison to capitalized interest reserves in each property s development budget, available construction budget contingency balances, and the funding of certain equity commitments by the owners of the underlying properties. Though original development budgets are sized to incorporate potential interest rate increases, the pace of recent interest rate increases has caused actual interest costs during construction to exceed original projections. In such instances, the developer has either reallocated other available reserves and contingencies, deferred its developer fees, or made direct cash payments during construction. Borrowers for all such investments are current on debt service as of September 30, 2024. In all instances, we have developer completion guaranties as well as capital contributed by LIHTC equity investors that will only receive their tax credits upon completion and stabilization of the projects, which create a strong disincentive to default. In certain instances, we have advanced supplemental loans to the borrowers secured by the underlying properties if returns meet our requirements and/or if such loans are necessary to meet the 50 tax-exempt financing requirements under the LIHTC regulations. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Partnership committed to fund additional supplemental loans to the Osprey Village and Willow Place Apartments properties up to 4.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, to provide additional capitalized interest reserves. In February 2024, all but 1.5 million of such supplemental loans were redeemed at par plus accrued interest. We expect the remaining supplemental loans to be repaid from refinance proceeds at the same time as the existing GIL and property loan investments are redeemed. 
 73 

Freddie Mac, through a servicer, has forward committed to purchase each GIL at maturity at par if the property has reached stabilization and other conditions are met. The Freddie Mac forward commitment includes a forward committed interest rate that was set at the original closing of the GIL, with many committed rates being well below current market interest rates. Such forward committed rates significantly reduce refinance risk and incentivize borrowers to convert to the Freddie Mac loan to realize interest savings. Since the beginning of 2023, seven of our GIL investments were purchased by Freddie Mac, through a servicer, and repaid in full. 
 Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments Segment 
 The Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments segment provides acquisition, construction and permanent financing for seniors housing and skilled nursing properties and a property loan associated with a master lease of essential healthcare support buildings. Seniors housing consists of a combination of independent living, assisted living and memory care units. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned two MRBs with aggregate outstanding principal of 59.7 million, with an outstanding commitment to provide additional funding of 7.3 million on a draw-down basis during construction. The MRBs are secured by a new construction, combined independent living, assisted living and memory care property in Traverse City, MI, with 174 total beds and a skilled nursing facility in Monroe Township, NJ with 120 beds. As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership also had a property loan with a principal balance of 7.3 million used to facilitate the purchase of a portfolio of nine essential healthcare support buildings located in eastern Pennsylvania. The loan is subordinate to the senior debt of the borrower and secured by a first priority security interest in master lease payments guaranteed by an investment grade healthcare system

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenues increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher average principal balances of approximately 26.0 million. 
 Total interest expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher average interest rates and higher average principal balances of approximately 17.8 million. 
 The net result from derivative transactions consists of realized and unrealized (gains) losses from our derivative financial instruments. Realized (gains) losses represent receipts or payments related to our interest rate swaps during the period. Unrealized (gains) losses are generally a result of changes in current and forward interest rates during the period. Increasing interest rates generally result in unrealized gains while decreasing interest rates generally result in unrealized losses. The following table summarizes the components of this line item for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Unrealized losses on derivatives, net, were approximately 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of approximately 863,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increased losses of approximately 2.3 million between the two periods. The increase in the unrealized losses was attributable to declining current and forward market interest rates which caused the fair value of our derivatives to decline. If the reference rates on our interest rate swaps continue to fall in the future, then we will likely experience additional unrealized losses on derivatives, net. See the Executive Summary section of this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 74 

The provision for credit losses for three months ended September 30, 2024 related to an increase in the principal balance related to a property loan during the third quarter of 2024. The Partnership did not have any investments in this segment that required a provision for credit loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The change in segment net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of the changes in the line items discussed above. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total revenues increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher average principal balances of approximately 32.2 million. 
 Total interest expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher average interest rates and higher average principal balances of approximately 29.0 million. 
 The net result from derivative transactions consists of realized and unrealized (gains) losses from our derivative financial instruments. Realized (gains) losses represent receipts or payments related to our interest rate swaps during the period. Unrealized (gains) losses are generally a result of changes in current and forward interest rates during the period.

Unrealized losses on derivatives, net, were approximately 580,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of approximately 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increased losses of approximately 1.7 million between the two periods. The increase in the unrealized losses was attributable to declining current and forward market interest rates which caused the fair value of our derivatives to decline. If the reference rates on our interest rate swaps continue to fall in the future, then we will likely experience additional unrealized losses on derivatives, net. See the Executive Summary section of this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to the initial allowance for credit loss for a new property loan investment during 2024. The Partnership did not have any investments in this segment that required a provision for credit loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The change in segment net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of the changes in the line items discussed above. 
 Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments Segment 
 The Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments segment consists of our noncontrolling joint venture equity investments in market-rate multifamily properties, also referred to as our investments in unconsolidated entities or JV Equity Investments. Our joint venture equity investments are passive in nature. Operational oversight of each property is controlled by our respective joint venture partners according to each respective entity s operating agreement. The properties are predominantly managed by property management companies affiliated with our joint venture partners. Decisions on when to sell an individual property are made by our respective joint venture partners based on their views of the local market conditions and current leasing trends. 
 We account for all our JV Equity Investments using the equity method and recognize our preferred returns during the hold period. Specifically for our Vantage JV Equity Investments, an affiliate of our Vantage joint venture partner provides a guaranty of our preferred returns through a date approximately five years after commencement of construction. Upon the sale of a property, net proceeds will be distributed according to the entity operating agreement. Sales proceeds distributed to us that represent previously unrecognized preferred return and gain on sale are recognized in net income upon receipt. Historically, the majority of our income from our JV Equity Investments is recognized at the time of sale. As a result, we may experience significant income recognition in those quarters when a property is sold and our equity investment is redeemed.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The decrease in total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the following: 
 A decrease of approximately 1.5 million of investment income due to certain investments meeting the maximum guaranteed preferred return during 2023 and 2024; and 

An increase of approximately 603,000 in investment income related to preferred returns on equity contributions during 2023 and 2024. 

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is related to our General LOC that is primarily secured by the JV Equity Investments. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a higher variable interest rate and higher average outstanding balances. 
 There was no gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to final settlement of the Vantage at Powdersville sale that occurred in May 2021. 
 Earnings (losses) on investments in unconsolidated entities is the Partnership s recognition of its proportionate share of earnings (losses) using the equity method of accounting. Such investments typically incur losses during development and lease-up, particularly from depreciation, consistent with development plans. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to general and administrative expenses at Valage Senior Living Carson Valley and interest expense at Freestone Cresta Bella as the property commenced leasing activities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The change in segment net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of changes in the line items discussed above. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The decrease in total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the following: 
 A decrease of approximately 3.9 million of investment income due to certain investments meeting the maximum guaranteed preferred return during 2023 and 2024; 

A decrease of approximately 2.3 million of investment income related to preferred return recognized upon the sale of Vantage at Stone Creek and Vantage at Coventry in January 2023 and Vantage at Conroe in June 2023; and 

An increase of approximately 2.0 million in investment income related to preferred returns on equity contributions during 2023 and 2024. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is related to our General LOC that is primarily secured by our JV Equity Investments. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to a higher variable interest rate on outstanding balances. 
 The gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to final settlement of the Vantage at Coventry sale that occurred in January 2023 and the Vantage at Westover Hills sale that occurred in May 2022. The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of the following: 
 76 

The sale of Vantage at Stone Creek in January 2023 for a gain of approximately 9.1 million; 

The sale of Vantage at Coventry in January 2023 for a gain of approximately 6.3 million; and 

The sale of Vantage at Conroe in June 2023 for a gain of approximately 7.3 million. 

Earnings (losses) on investments in unconsolidated entities is the Partnership s recognition of its proportionate share of earnings (losses) using the equity method of accounting. Such investments typically incur losses during development and lease-up, particularly from depreciation, consistent with development plans. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to general and administrative expenses at Valage Senior Living Carson Valley and interest expense at Freestone Cresta Bella as the property commenced leasing activities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The change in segment net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the change in total revenues and gains on sales of unconsolidated entities discussed above. 
 Operational Matters 
 We have noted no material construction cost overruns for securing materials and labor needed to construct the properties underlying our JV Equity Investments, despite general supply chain constraints noted in recent years. However, Vantage at McKinney Falls did experience cost overruns due to delayed utility connections to the site by the local municipality. The lack of water connections delayed vertical construction and caused the general contractor to incur additional general conditions costs to otherwise ensure progress in construction. To date, we have contributed additional equity of 1.0 million to cover cost overages related to these delays. 
 The construction loans associated with our JV Equity Investments typically have variable interest rates, so we regularly monitor interest costs in comparison to capitalized interest reserves in each property s development budget and available construction budget contingency balances. Though original development budgets were sized to incorporate potential interest rate increases, the pace of recent interest rate increases has caused actual interest costs during construction to exceed original budgets. We have noted that some properties that are complete or nearing construction completion are incurring interest costs that exceed capitalized interest reserves, and such properties have utilized construction contingencies and developers have deferred a portion of their developer fee payments. Under the operating agreements, if additional capital is required, the parties to the JV Equity Investment will mutually agree on how to fund additional capital. From January through October 2024, we agreed to advance additional equity totaling 7.5 million across five Vantage JV Equity Investments to cover additional interest costs. We anticipate advancing additional equity to certain JV Equity Investments during the remainder of 2024 though the ultimate amount is uncertain. The amount of such additional funding will depend on various future developments, including, but not limited to, the pace of development, changes in interest rates, the pace of lease-up, and overall operating results of the underlying properties. We plan to contribute such additional funds with cash on hand or other currently available liquidity sources. Such additional equity may result in lower overall returns on our JV Equity Investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Vantage at Tomball, Vantage at Helotes, Vantage at Fair Oaks, and Vantage at Hutto had achieved approximately 90 physical occupancy. The managing member of each property is evaluating options for the sale of each property. 
 Vantage at McKinney Falls completed construction in July 2024 and was 46 leased as of September 30, 2024. Vantage at Loveland began leasing units in May 2024, completed construction in October 2024, and was 28 leased as of September 30, 2024. Freestone Cresta Bella began leasing activities in September 2024. 
 MF Properties Segment 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership did not own any MF Properties. The Partnership previously owned the Suites on Paseo MF Property until the property was sold in December 2023 and there is no continuing involvement with the property. The Partnership previously sold The 50/50 MF Property to an unrelated non-profit organization in December 2022 in exchange for a seller financing property loan which is included in the MF Properties Segment.

Discussion of Occupancy at Investment-Related Properties 
 The following tables summarize occupancy and other information regarding the properties underlying our various investment classes. The narrative discussion that follows provides a brief operating analysis of each investment class as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Non-Consolidated Properties Stabilized 
 The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. These properties have met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table) as of September 30, 2024. Debt service on our MRBs for the non-consolidated stabilized properties was current as of September 30, 2024. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.

(1) Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement. 

(2) Economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property. This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units. Physical occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented. Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time. 

(3) A property is considered stabilized once it reaches 90 physical occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for a period after construction completion or completion of the rehabilitation. 

(4) Physical occupancy information is not available for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and economic occupancy information is not available for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the property was recently acquired. 

79 

(5) The MRB is defeased and as such, the Partnership does not report property occupancy information. 

Physical occupancy as of September 30, 2024 is consistent with the same period in 2023. The physical occupancy at various Avistar properties and Renaissance has declined in recent periods due to operational issues. The property owners have made certain personnel changes and has indicated that leasing is improving in 2024. The physical occupancy at Crossing at 1415 has declined due to economic factors in its submarket and property management is working to address the declines. These declines have been partially offset with improved performance at Live 929 Apartments. We will continue to monitor and discuss property operations with the individual borrowers for Live 929 Apartments, the Avistar properties, Renaissance, and Crossing 1415 to ensure noted performance issues are addressed. 
 Economic occupancy for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in rental revenue as a result of the declines in physical occupancy noted above. 
 Restricted rents at affordable multifamily properties are tied to changes in AMI, which has generally been increasing in the United States as overall wages increased significantly in 2021 through 2023. AMI is updated on a one-year lag, so restricted rental rates will increase on a similar lag and is realized upon annual lease renewals. On an overall basis, we noted same-property maximum rental income amounts increased 5.9 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, which is significantly higher than average historical annual rent increases. In addition, we observed an increase in same-property net rental revenue of 4.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. As restricted rents adjust over time on a lag, increasing maximum rental income amounts may contribute to a temporary decline in economic occupancy even though property rental revenues are increasing overall. 
 Decatur Angle and Bruton Apartments continue to have low physical and economic occupancy, though Bruton Apartments has improved in recent quarters. The properties are continuing to remove non-paying tenants now that local regulations permit tenant evictions. The removals have resulted in higher than historical bad debt write-offs, temporary declines in physical occupancy, and high repairs and maintenance costs to ready units to be leased to new tenants. We continue to monitor and discuss property operations with the individual borrowers to assess progress towards resolving performance issues.

Non-Consolidated Properties - Not Stabilized 
 The owners of the following residential properties do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of each VIE. As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. As of September 30, 2024, these residential properties have not met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table). As of September 30, 2024, debt service on the Partnership s MRBs and GILs for the non-consolidated, non-stabilized properties was current. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.

JV Equity Investments 
 We are a noncontrolling equity investor in various unconsolidated entities formed for the purpose of constructing market-rate, multifamily real estate properties. The Partnership determined the JV Equity Investments are VIEs but that the Partnership is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Partnership does not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. The one exception is Vantage at San Marcos, for which the Partnership is deemed the primary beneficiary and reports the entity's assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis. Our JV Equity Investments entitle us to shares of certain cash flows generated by the entities from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinance or sale. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property management service providers.

Discussion of Total Revenues and Other Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income. The increase in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the following factors: 
 An increase of approximately 2.7 million in interest income from recent MRB advances, offset by a decrease of approximately 526,000 in interest income due to MRB redemptions and principal repayments; 

An increase of approximately 1.1 million in interest income due to discount accretion on the Southpark MRB upon redemption at par in July 2024; 

A decrease of approximately 1.8 million in interest income due to recent GIL redemptions, offset by an increase of approximately 789,000 in interest income from recent GIL investments and higher average interest rates; 

A decrease of approximately 972,000 of investment income related to unconsolidated entities consisting of: 

o A decrease of approximately 1.6 million of investment income due to certain investments meeting the maximum guaranteed preferred return during 2023 and 2024; and 

o An increase of approximately 603,000 in investment income related to preferred returns on equity contributions during 2023 and 2024. 

Other interest income. Other interest income is comprised primarily of interest income on our property loan, taxable MRB, and taxable GIL investments. The decrease in other interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to: 
 A decrease of approximately 1.8 million from lower average property loan, taxable MRB and taxable GIL investment balances of approximately 84.3 million; and 

A decrease of approximately 574,000 in other interest income due to decreasing interest earned on cash balances. 

Property revenues. The decrease in property revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is due to the sale of the Suites on Paseo MF Property in December 2023.

Other income. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to the receipt of non-refundable fees for the extension of various GIL and property loan maturity dates. 
 Gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities. There was no gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to final settlement of the Vantage at Powdersville sale that occurred in May 2021. 
 Earnings (losses) on investments in unconsolidated entities. The Partnership reports its proportionate share of earnings (losses) on investments in unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. Such investments typically incur losses during development and lease-up, particularly from depreciation, consistent with development plans. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to general and administrative expenses at Valage Senior Living Carson Valley and interest expense at Freestone Cresta Bella as the property commenced leasing activities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Discussion of Total Revenues and Other Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income. The decrease in investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the following factors: 
 A decrease of approximately 7.0 million in interest income due to recent GIL redemptions, offset by an increase of approximately 3.3 million in interest income from recent GIL investments and higher average interest rates; 

An increase of approximately 6.8 million in interest income from recent MRB advances, offset by a decrease of approximately 1.3 million in interest income due to MRB redemptions and principal repayments; 

An increase of approximately 1.1 million in interest income due to discount accretion on the Southpark MRB upon redemption at par in July 2024; 

A decrease of approximately 4.3 million of investment income related to JV Equity Investments consisting of: 

o A decrease of approximately 3.9 million of investment income due to certain investments meeting the maximum guaranteed preferred return during 2023 and 2024; 

o A decrease of approximately 2.3 million of investment income related to preferred return recognized upon the sale of Vantage at Stone Creek and Vantage at Coventry in January 2023 and Vantage at Conroe in June 2023; and 

o An increase of approximately 2.0 in investment income related to preferred returns on equity contributions during 2023 and 2024. 

Other interest income. Other interest income is comprised primarily of interest income on our property loan, taxable MRB, and taxable GIL investments. The decrease in other interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to: 
 A decrease of approximately 5.8 million from lower average property loan, taxable MRB and taxable GIL investment balances of approximately 93.3 million; and 

A decrease of approximately 602,000 in other interest income due to decreasing interest earned on cash balances. 

Property revenues. The decrease in property revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is due to the sale of the Suites on Paseo MF Property in December 2023. 
 Other income. Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to the receipt of non-refundable fees for the extension of various GIL and property loan maturity dates. 
 Gain on sale of real estate assets. The gain on sale of real estate assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to final purchase price adjustments for the Suites on Paseo MF Property that was sold in December 2023. There was no gain on sale of real estate assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain on sale of mortgage revenue bond. The gain on sale of mortgage revenue bond for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the sale of the Brookstone MRB in May 2024. There was no gain on sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities. The gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to final settlement of the Vantage at Coventry sale that occurred in January 2023 and the 
 85 

Vantage at Westover Hills sale that occurred in May 2022. The gain on sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of the following: 
 The sale of Vantage at Stone Creek in January 2023 for a gain of approximately 9.1 million; 

The sale of Vantage at Coventry in January 2023 for a gain of approximately 6.3 million; and 

The sale of Vantage at Conroe in June 2023 for a gain of approximately 7.3 million. 

Earnings (losses) on investments in unconsolidated entities. The Partnership reports its proportionate share of earnings (losses) on investments in unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting. Such investments typically incur losses during development and lease-up, particularly from depreciation, consistent with development plans. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to general and administrative expenses at Valage Senior Living Carson Valley and interest expense at Freestone Cresta Bella as the property commenced leasing activities during the third quarter of 2024.

Discussion of Total Expenses for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Real estate operating expenses. Real estate operating expenses are related to MF Properties and are comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees. There were no real estate operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the sale of the Suites on Paseo MF Property in December 2023. 
 Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relates to declining expected credit losses for our portfolio of GIL, taxable GIL and property loan investments and was primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions during 2023 and 2024, a decrease in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the Partnership s model to estimate the allowance for credit losses. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization relate primarily to the MF Properties. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to the sale of the Suites on Paseo MF Property in December 2023. 
 Interest expense. The decrease in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was due primarily to the following factors: 
 A decrease of approximately 2.3 million due to lower average principal outstanding of approximately 33.5 million; and 

A decrease of approximately 176,000 due to lower average interest rates on debt financing. 

Net result from derivative transactions. The net result from derivative transactions consists of realized and unrealized (gains) losses from our derivative financial instruments. Realized (gains) losses represent receipts or payments related to our interest rate swaps during the period. Unrealized (gains) losses are generally a result of changes in current and forward interest rates during the period. Increasing interest rates generally result in unrealized gains while decreasing interest rates generally result in unrealized losses. The following table summarizes the components of this line item for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Unrealized losses on derivatives, net, were approximately 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of approximately 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increased losses of approximately 13.9 million between the two periods. The increase in the unrealized losses was attributable to declining current and forward market interest rates which caused the fair value of our derivatives to decline. If the reference rates on our interest rate swaps continue to fall in the future, then we will likely experience additional unrealized losses on derivatives, net. See the Executive Summary section of this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 General and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 245,000 in employee compensation and benefits. 
 Discussion of Total Expenses for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Real estate operating expenses. Real estate operating expenses are related to MF Properties and are comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees. There were no real estate operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the sale of the Suites on Paseo MF Property in December 2023. 
 Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to: 
 Declining expected credit losses of approximately 1.1 million for our remaining portfolio of GILs, taxable GILs, property loans, and unfunded commitments that was primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions during 2024, a decrease in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the Partnership s model to estimate the allowance for credit losses; 

The recovery of approximately 169,000 of prior credit losses in connection with final settlement of the bankruptcy estate of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB; and 

An increase of approximately 215,000 due to a new property loan investment during 2024. 

The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to declining expected credit losses for our portfolio of GIL, taxable GIL and property loan investments and was primarily due to GIL and property loan redemptions during 2023, a decrease in the weighted average life of the remaining investment portfolio, and updates of market data used as quantitative assumptions in the Partnership s model to estimate the allowance for credit losses. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization relate primarily to the MF Properties. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to the sale of the Suites on Paseo MF Property in December 2023. 
 Interest expense. The decrease in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was due to the following factors: 
 A decrease of approximately 9.6 million due to lower average principal outstanding of approximately 90.7 million; 

An increase of approximately 2.2 million due to higher average interest rates on debt financing; and 

A decrease of approximately 564,000 in amortization of deferred financing costs. 

Net result from derivative transactions. The net result from derivative transactions consists of realized and unrealized (gains) losses from our derivative financial instruments. Realized (gains) losses represent receipts or payments related to our interest rate swaps during the period. Unrealized (gains) losses are generally a result of changes in current and forward interest rates during the period. Increasing interest rates generally result in unrealized gains while decreasing interest rates generally result in unrealized losses.

Unrealized losses on derivatives, net, were approximately 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gains of approximately 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in increased losses of approximately 11.7 million between the two periods. The increase in the unrealized losses was attributable to declining current and forward market interest rates which caused the fair value of our derivatives to decline. If the reference rates on our interest rate swaps continue to fall in the future, then we will likely experience additional unrealized losses on derivatives, net. See the Executive Summary section of this Item 2 for additional discussion. 
 General and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to decreases of approximately 194,000 in administration fees paid to the General Partner due to lower assets under management, and approximately 429,000 in employee compensation and benefits. 
 Discussion of Income Tax Expense for the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 A wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, the Greens Hold Co, is a corporation subject to federal and state income tax. The Greens Hold Co owns certain property loans. The Greens Hold Co sold its ownership interest in The 50/50 MF Property to an unrelated non-profit organization in December 2022 and deferred a gain on sale of approximately 6.6 million. There was minimal taxable income for the Greens Hold Co for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Cash Available for Distribution - Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit) and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also adjusts net income for the Partnership s share of (earnings) losses of investments in unconsolidated entities as such amounts are primarily depreciation expenses and development costs that are expected to be recovered upon an exit event. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 22 to the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 88 

The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the BUCs Distributions on a retroactive basis for all periods presented):

(1) The adjustments reflect the change in allowances for credit losses under the CECL standard which requires the Partnership to update estimates of expected credit losses for its investment portfolio at each reporting date. In connection with the final settlement of the bankruptcy estate of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in July 2024, the Partnership recovered approximately 169,000 of its previously recognized allowance credit loss which is not included as an adjustment to net income in the calculation of CAD. 

(2) As described in Note 22 to the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75 to the limited partners and BUC holders, as a class, and 25 to the General Partner. This adjustment represents 25 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Tier 2 income allocable to the General Partner consisted of approximately 3.8 million related to the gains on sale of Vantage at Stone Creek and Vantage at Coventry in January 2023 and approximately 813,000 related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Conroe in June 2023, offset by a 1.4 million Tier 2 loss allocable to the General Partner related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB realized in January 2023 upon receipt of the majority of expected bankruptcy liquidation proceeds. 
 
 (3) The Partnership determined there was a recovery of previously recognized impairment recorded for the Live 929 Apartments Series 2022A MRB prior to the adoption of the CECL standard effective January 1, 2023. The Partnership is accreting the recovery of prior credit loss for this MRB into investment income over the term of the MRB consistent with applicable guidance. The accretion of recovery of value is presented as a reduction to current CAD as the original provision for credit loss was an addback for CAD calculation purposes in the period recognized. 

(4) The Partnership declared the First Quarter 2024 BUCs Distribution payable in the form of additional BUCs equal to 0.07 per BUC for outstanding BUCs as of the record date of March 28, 2024. The Partnership declared the Second Quarter 2023 BUCs Distribution payable in the form of additional BUCs equal to 0.07 per BUC for outstanding BUCs as of the record date of June 30, 2023 and the Third Quarter 2023 BUCs Distribution payable in the form of additional BUCs equal to 0.07 per BUC for outstanding BUCs as of the record date of September 29, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We continually evaluate our potential sources and uses of liquidity, including current and potential future developments related to market interest rates and the general economic and geopolitical environment. The information below is based on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends, which could materially differ from actual results. See the discussion of Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Partnership s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information. 
 89 

Our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months will be primarily operational expenses, investment commitments net of leverage secured by the investment assets; debt service (principal and interest payments) related to our debt financings; repayments of our secured lines of credit balances; and distribution payments to Unitholders. We expect to meet these liquidity requirements primarily using cash on hand, operating cash flows from our investments, redemptions of various investment asset at the stated maturity dates, and potentially additional debt financing issued in the normal course of business. In addition, we will consider the issuance of additional BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, or other series of limited partnership interests in the Partnership based on needs and opportunities for executing our strategy. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements will be primarily for maturities of debt financings and funding the purchase of additional investment assets, net of leverage secured by the investment assets, and repayments of our secured lines of credit balances. We expect to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through refinancing of maturing debt financings with the same or similar lenders; contractual principal and interest payments from our investments; and proceeds from asset redemptions and sales in the normal course of business. In addition, we will consider the issuance of additional BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, or other series of limited partnership interests in the Partnership based on needs and opportunities for executing our strategy. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 The Partnership s principal sources of liquidity consist of: 
 Unrestricted cash on hand; 

Operating cash flows from investment assets; 

Secured lines of credit; 

Proceeds from the redemption or sale of assets; 

Proceeds from obtaining additional debt; and 

Issuances of debt securities, BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, or other series of limited partnership interests. 

Unrestricted Cash on Hand 
 As of September 30, 2024, we reported unrestricted cash on hand of approximately 37.4 million. There are no contractual restrictions on our ability to use unrestricted cash on hand. The Partnership has a financial covenant to maintain a minimum consolidated liquidity of 6.3 million under the terms of our financing arrangements. 
 Operating Cash Flows from Investments 
 Cash flows from operations are primarily comprised of regular principal and interest payments received on our investment assets that provide consistent cash receipts throughout the year. All MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans are current on contractual debt service payments as of September 30, 2024. Investment receipts, net of interest expense on related debt financing and lines of credit, are available for our general use. We also receive distributions from JV Equity Investments if, and when, cash is available for distribution. 
 Receipt of cash from our investments in MRBs, taxable MRBs, and JV Equity Investments is dependent upon the generation of net cash flows at multifamily properties that underlie these investments. These underlying properties are subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate, which include (but are not limited to) reduced occupancy, tenant defaults, falling rental rates, and increasing operating expenses. 
 Receipt of cash from our investments in GILs, taxable GILs, and construction financing and mezzanine property loans is dependent on the availability of funds in the original development budgets. The current rising interest rate environment is resulting in higher interest costs for properties with variable rate construction financing. We regularly monitor capitalized interest costs in comparison to capitalized interest reserves in the property s development budget, available construction cost contingencies balances, and the funding of certain equity commitments by the owners of the underlying property. The developers may also make cash payments to pay interest due to avoid claims under their payment and completion guaranties. 
 90 

Secured Lines of Credit 
 We maintain a General LOC with a commitment of up to 50.0 million to purchase additional investments and to meet general working capital and liquidity requirements. We may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts at any time through the maturity date, subject to the limitations of a borrowing base. The aggregate available commitment cannot exceed a borrowing base calculation, which is equal to 35 multiplied by the aggregate value of a pool of eligible encumbered assets. Eligible encumbered assets consist of 100 of our equity capital contributions to JV Equity Investments, subject to certain limits and restrictions. The General LOC is secured by first priority security interests in our JV Equity Investments. We have the ability to increase the total maximum commitment by an additional 10.0 million to 60.0 million, subject to the identification of lenders to provide the additional commitment, the payment of certain fees, and other conditions. We will evaluate whether to increase the commitment based on the size of the borrowing base, liquidity needs and costs of such additional commitments. We are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants that, among others, require us to maintain consolidated liquidity of not less than 6.3 million (which will increase up to a maximum of 7.5 million if the maximum available commitment is fully increased to 60.0 million) and maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than 200.0 million. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. The balance of the General LOC was 40.5 million with the ability to draw an additional 9.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The General LOC has a maturity date of June 2025, with options to extend for up to two additional years, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 We maintain an Acquisition LOC with a commitment of up to 50.0 million that may be used to fund purchases of MRBs, taxable MRBs, or loans issued to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of affordable housing, or which are otherwise secured by real estate or mortgage-backed securities (i.e., GILs, taxable GILs, and property loans), or master lease agreements guaranteed by investment grade tenants. Advances on the Acquisition LOC are generally due on the 270 th day following the advance date but may be extended for up to an additional 270 days by making certain payments. Advances made for tax-exempt or taxable loans secured by master lease agreements guaranteed by investment grade tenants are due on the 45th day following such advance. The Acquisition LOC contains a covenant, among others, that our senior debt will not exceed a specified percentage of the market value of our assets to be consistent with the Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Partnership). We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. There was a balance of 3.9 million outstanding on the Acquisition LOC and approximately 46.1 million was available as of September 30, 2024. The Acquisition LOC has a maturity date of June 2025, with a one-year extension option, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 Proceeds from the Redemption or Sale of Assets 
 We may, from time to time, experience redemptions of or execute sales of our investments in MRBs, GILs, property loans, JV Equity Investments and MF Properties consistent with our strategic plans. Borrowers on certain of our MRBs, GILs, and property loans have the right to prepay amounts outstanding prior to contractual maturity which would result in the return of our capital, net of repayment of leverage on the related asset. We received redemption proceeds from the redemptions of the Southpark MRB, Runnymede MRB, and Magnolia Heights GIL and property loan during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Our MRB portfolio is marked at a premium to cost, adjusted for paydowns, primarily due to higher stated interest rates when compared to current market interest rates for investments with similar terms. In May 2024, we sold the Brookstone MRB for gross proceeds of approximately 8.2 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of approximately 1.0 million. We may consider selling certain MRB investments in exchange for cash at prices that approximate our currently reported fair value. However, we are contractually prevented from selling the MRB investments included in our TEBS financings. 
 Our ability to dispose of investment assets on favorable terms is dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to, the number of potential buyers and the availability of credit to such potential buyers to purchase investment assets at prices we consider acceptable. Recent volatility in market interest rates, recent inflation and the potential for an economic recession may negatively impact the potential prices we could realize upon the disposition of our various assets. 
 Our JV Equity Investments are passive in nature and decisions on when to sell an individual property are made by our joint venture partner based on its view of the local market conditions and current leasing trends. We are entitled to proceeds upon the sales of JV Equity Investments in accordance with the terms of the entity operating agreement. We received sales proceeds from JV Equity Investment sales in 2023 totaling 47.7 million. There have been no sales to date in 2024, though Vantage at Tomball and Vantage at Hutto have been listed for sale by the respective managing members with sales expected to close in the next three to six months. 
 Many of our GIL and property loan investments have maturity dates within the next 12 months, which will be purchased by Freddie Mac, through a servicer, or repaid by the borrower on or before the maturity at prices equal to the principal outstanding plus accrued interest. Such proceeds will be primarily used to repay our related debt financing. We regularly monitor the progress of the underlying properties and the likelihood of redemption upon maturity and currently have no concerns regarding repayment. Borrowers of certain GIL and property loan investments may request an extension of the maturity dates up to six months, subject to meeting various 
 91 

conditions, obtaining an approval of Freddie Mac to extend the maturity date of the forward purchase commitment, and payment of an extension fee to us. 
 Proceeds from Obtaining Additional Debt 
 We hold certain investments that are not associated with our debt financings or secured LOCs. We may obtain leverage for these investments by posting the investments as security. As of September 30, 2024, all leverageable assets were associated with a debt financing facility or our Acquisition LOC. 
 Issuances of Debt Securities, BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units or Series B Preferred Units 
 We may, from time to time, issue additional BUCs, Preferred Units, or debt securities, in one or more offerings, at prices or quantities that are consistent with our strategic goals. In December 2022, the Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may, from time to time, offer and sell BUCs, Preferred Units, or debt securities, in one or more offerings, with a maximum aggregate offering price of 300.0 million. Debt securities issued under the Shelf Registration Statement may be senior or subordinate obligations of the Partnership. The Shelf Registration Statement will expire in December 2025. 
 In March 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC and BTIG, LLC, as Agents, pursuant to which the Partnership may offer and sell, from time to time through or to the Agents, BUCs having an aggregate offering price of up to 50,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 92,802 BUCs for gross proceeds of 1.5 million under the Sales Agreement. 
 We have one registration statement on Form S-3 covering the offering of Preferred Units that has been declared effective by the SEC. The following table summarizes the Partnership's current Preferred Unit offering:

(1) The Partnership is able to issue Series B Preferred Units so long as the aggregate market capitalization of the BUCs, based on the closing price on the trading day prior to issuance of the Series B Preferred Units, is no less than two times the aggregate book value of all Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units, inclusive of the amount to be issued. 

In February 2024, we issued 500,000 Series B Preferred Units to a new investor under a prior registration statement on Form S-3 for gross proceeds of 5.0 million. 
 In April 2024, we commenced a registered offering of up to 25,000,000 of BUCs which are being offered and sold pursuant to the effective Shelf Registration Statement and a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC relating to this offering. As of the date of this filing, we have not issued any BUCs in connection with this offering. 
 We may also designate and issue additional series of preferred units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement. 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 Our principal uses of liquidity consist of: 
 General and administrative expenses; 

Investment funding commitments; 

Debt service on debt financings, the TEBS Residual Financing, mortgages payable, and secured lines of credit; 

Distributions paid to holders of Preferred Units and BUCs; 

Redemptions of Preferred Units; and 

Other contractual obligations.

General and Administrative Expenses 
 We use cash to pay general and administrative expenses of our operations. For additional details, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the section captioned Cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows set forth in Item 1 of this report. General and administrative expenses are typically paid from unrestricted cash on hand and operating cash flows. 
 Investment Funding Commitments 
 Our overall strategy is to invest in quality multifamily properties through the acquisition of MRBs, GILs, property loans and JV Equity Investments in both existing and new markets. We evaluate investment opportunities based on, but not limited to, our market outlook, including general economic conditions, development opportunities and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, access to long-term financing sources, and the availability of investment capital. We may commit to fund additional investments on a draw-down or forward basis. The following table summarizes our outstanding investment commitments as of September 30, 2024:

(1) Projected fundings by year are based on current estimates and the actual funding schedule may differ materially due to, but not limited to, the pace of construction, adverse weather conditions, delays in governmental approvals or permits, the availability of materials and contractors, and labor disputes. 

(2) The variable index interest rate components are subject to a floor of 0.27 . 

(3) We have securitized the indicated assets in TOB financing facilities that allow for additional principal proceeds as the remaining investment commitments are funded by us. See Note 13 for further details on debt financing. 

(4) Upon stabilization, the MRB will convert to a fixed rate of 8.0 and become subordinate to the other senior MRBs of the borrower. 

(5) The borrower may elect to extend the maturity date for up to six months upon meeting certain conditions, which may include payment of a non-refundable extension fee. 

(6) Upon stabilization, the MRB will resize to an amount not to exceed 3.3 million and become subordinate to the other senior MRBs of the borrower. In December 2029, the interest rate will convert to a fixed rate of 10.0 . 

(7) The interest rate will convert to a variable rate of Term SOFR + 3.35 on February 1, 2025. 

(8) The property became a consolidated VIE effective during the fourth quarter of 2021. 

(9) A development site has been identified for this property but construction had not commenced as of September 30, 2024. 

In addition, we will consider providing additional financing to borrowers on our debt investments or additional equity to our JV Equity Investments above our original commitments if requested by the borrowers and managing members, respectively, on a case-by-case basis. When considering whether to fund such requests, we will consider various factors including, but not limited to, the economic 
 93 

return on additional investments in the entity, the impact to the Partnership s credit and investment risk from either funding or withholding funding, and the requesting entity s other available sources of funding. 
 During January through October 2024, we advanced additional capital totaling 8.5 million across five Vantage JV Equity Investments. The additional capital was used to cover development cost overruns, primarily due to higher than anticipated interest costs. We anticipate making additional investments in certain JV Equity Investments during 2024 though the ultimate amount is uncertain. The amount of such additional funding will depend on various future developments, including, but not limited to, the pace of development, changes in interest rates, the pace of lease-up, and overall operating results of the underlying properties. The Partnership plans to contribute such additional funds with cash on hand or other currently available liquidity sources. 
 Debt Service on Debt Financings, the TEBS Residual Financing, Mortgage Payable and Secured Lines of Credit 
 Our debt financing arrangements consist of various secured financing transactions to leverage our portfolio of MRB, taxable MRB, GIL, taxable GIL and certain property loan investment assets. The financing arrangements generally involve the securitization of these investment assets into trusts whereby we retain beneficial interests in the trusts that provide us certain rights to the underlying investment assets. The senior securities are sold to unaffiliated parties in exchange for debt proceeds. The senior securities require periodic interest payments that may be fixed or variable, depending on the terms of the arrangement, and scheduled principal payments. We are required to fund any shortfall in principal and interest payable to the senior securities of the TEBS financings in the case of non-payment, forbearance or default of the borrowers contractual debt service payments of the related MRBs, up to the value of our residual interests. In the case of forbearance or default on an underlying investment asset in a term TOB or TOB trust financing, we may be required to fund shortfalls in principal and interest payable to the senior securities, repurchase a portion of the outstanding senior securities, or repurchase the underlying investment asset and seek alternative financing. We anticipate that cash flows from the securitized investment assets will fund normal, recurring principal and interest payments to the senior securities and all trust-related fees. 
 When possible, we structure the debt financing maturity dates associated with our GIL, taxable GIL, and property loan investments to match the investment maturity dates such that investment redemption proceeds will paydown the outstanding debt financing. 
 Our debt financing arrangements include various fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. Recent increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in increases in the interest costs associated with our variable rate debt financing arrangements. We actively manage our portfolio of fixed and variable rate debt financings and our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The following table summarizes our fixed and variable rate debt financings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

(1) The securitized assets and related debt financing each have variable interest rates, though the variable rate indices may differ on individual transactions. As such, the Partnership is largely hedged against rising interest rates. 

(2) The variable-rate debt financing is hedged through our interest rate swap agreements. Though the variable rate indices may differ, these interest rate swaps have effectively synthetically fixed the interest rate of the related debt financing. See further discussion of our interest rate hedging activities below. 

The interest rate paid on our variable rate debt financings are generally determined by the senior securities remarketing agent as the rate necessary to remarket any senior securities tendered by holders thereof for remarketing that week at a price of par. Interest on the senior securities is either taxable or tax-exempt to the holders based on the structure of the TOB financing. The senior securities rate on TOB financings structured as tax-exempt to the senior securities holders are typically correlated to tax-exempt municipal short-term securities indices, such as SIFMA. The senior securities rate on TOB financings structured as taxable to the senior securities holders are typically correlated to taxable short-term securities indices, such as SOFR. 
 We have hedged a portion of our overall exposure to changes in market interest rates on our variable rate debt financings through various interest rate swaps. Our interest rate swaps are subject to monthly settlements whereby we pay a stated fixed rate and our counterparty pays a variable rate equal to the compounded SOFR rate for the settlement period. We are currently a net receiver on our portfolio of interest rate swaps and received net settlement proceeds totaling 1.8 million and 5.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 94 

The majority of our variable rate debt financings that are hedged through interest rate swaps have interest that is tax-exempt to the senior securities holders. In order to account for the differential between our interest rate swaps which are indexed to SOFR (a taxable rate) and our debt financing rate (which is correlated to short-term tax-exempt municipal securities rates), we assume that, over the term of our debt financing, the tax-exempt senior securities interest rate will approximate 70 of the SOFR rate. This assumption aligns with common market assumptions and the historical correlation between taxable and tax-exempt municipal short-term securities rates. However, such ratio may not be accurate in the short term or long term in the future. We apply a 70 conversion ratio when determining the notional amount of our interest rate swaps such that, as an example, a 7.0 million notional amount indexed to SOFR is the equivalent to 10.0 million notional amount for tax-exempt debt financing. As such, the reported amount of variable debt financing in the table above exceeds the stated notional amount of the SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024. The following table summarizes the average stated SOFR-denominated notional amount by year for our existing interest rate swaps (before applying our assumed 70 ratio of tax-exempt municipal securities rates to SOFR):

When we execute a TOB trust financing, we retain a residual interest that is pledged as our initial collateral under the ISDA master agreement based on the market value of the investment asset(s) at the time of initial closing. If the net aggregate value of our investment assets in TOB trust financings and our interest rate swap agreements decline below a certain threshold, then we are required to post additional collateral with our counterparties. We had posted approximately 10.4 million of cash collateral with Mizuho as of September 30, 2024 due to declines in the value of our fixed interest rate investment assets funded with TOB trusts resulting from generally rising market interest rates. We have satisfied all collateral calls using unrestricted cash on hand. Continuing volatility in market interest rates and potential deterioration of general economic conditions may cause the value of our investment assets to decline and result in the posting of additional collateral in the future. The valuation of our interest rate swaps move inversely with the change in valuation of our investment assets, so the change in valuation of our interest rate swaps partially offset the change in value of our investment assets when determining the amount of collateral posting requirements. 
 Our TEBS Residual Financing is secured by the cash flows from the residual certificates of our TEBS financings. Interest due on the TEBS Residual Financing is at a fixed rate of 7.125 per annum and will be paid from receipts related to the TEBS financing residual certificates. Future receipts of principal related to the TEBS financing residual certificates will be used to pay down the principal of the TEBS Residual Financing. The TEBS Residual Financing is non-recourse financing to the Partnership and is not subject to mark-to-market collateral posting. 
 Our General LOC and Acquisition LOC require monthly interest payments on outstanding balances and certain quarterly commitment fees. Such obligations are paid primarily from operating cash flows. The Acquisition LOC requires principal payments as previously described in this Item 2. The General LOC does not require principal payments until maturity in June 2025, subject to extension options, so long as the outstanding principal does not exceed the borrowing base calculation.

The table above is as of September 30, 2024, and does not reflect the various debt financing transactions that occurred in October and November 2024 and are disclosed in Note 25 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 95 

In October 2024, we completed the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction. The securitization involved the sale of custodial receipts representing partial interests in 14 MRBs to a municipal conduit issuer, which then issued and sold 75.4 million of Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates to third-party investors in exchange for financing proceeds. For financial reporting purposes, the Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates of the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction are considered debt financing of the Partnership. See Note 25 for further information on the transaction. The term of the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction will end upon repayment of the 75.4 million of Affordable Housing Multifamily Certificates from underlying principal payments on the custodial receipts, which will be no later than September 2039. The proceeds of the 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction were used to repay the outstanding principal of the M31 TEBS Financing and various TOB and Term TOB financings that are disclosed in Note 25 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The 2024 PFA Securitization Transaction is non-recourse to the Partnership, does not require mark-to-market collateral posting, has a term that matches the term of the underlying MRBs, and bears interest at a fixed rate. 
 Distributions Paid to Holders of Preferred Units and BUCs 
 Distributions to the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Units, if declared by the General Partner, are paid quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 3.0 . Distributions to the holders of Series B Preferred Units, if declared by the General Partner, are paid quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.75 . The Series A-1 Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units are non-cumulative, non-voting and non-convertible. 
 On September 16, 2024, we announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager, which is the general partner of the General Partner, declared a quarterly cash distribution of 0.37 per BUC to unitholders of record on September 30, 2024 and payable on October 31, 2024. 
 The Partnership and its General Partner continually assess the level of distributions for the Preferred Units and BUCs based on cash available for distribution, financial performance and other factors considered relevant. 
 Redemptions of Preferred Units 
 Our outstanding Series A-1 and Series B Preferred Units are subject to optional redemption by the holders or the Partnership upon the sixth anniversary of issuance and on each anniversary thereafter. The earliest optional redemption dates for the currently outstanding Preferred Units range from April 2028 to February 2030. 
 Other Contractual Obligations 
 We are subject to various guaranty obligations in the normal course of business, and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments. 
 96 

Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash of 86,000, which was the net result of 13.3 million provided by operating activities, 38.6 million used in investing activities, and 25.3 million provided by financing activities. 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.2 million generated for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change between periods was primarily due to the following factors: 
 A decrease of 36.6 million in net income, offset by the 22.7 million adjustment for the gain on sale of unconsolidated entities that is considered cash from investing activities; 

A increase of 11.8 million related to a reduction in the unrealized gain on interest rate derivatives; 

A decrease of 1.0 million related to the adjustment for the gain on sale of mortgage revenue bond that is considered cash from investing activities; 

A decrease of 1.1 million related to the amortization of bond premium, discount and origination fees; 

A decrease of 2,968,000 of cash related to changes in the Partnership's net operating assets and liabilities; 

A decrease of 1,206,000 related to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense; and 

A total increase of 869,000 in non-cash provisions for credit loss and loan loss. 

Cash used in investing activities totaled 38.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash generated of 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change between periods was primarily due to the following factors: 
 A net increase of 28.5 million of cash due to lower advances on MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans; 

A net decrease of 43.8 million of cash due to overall higher paydowns and redemptions of MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans; 

An increase of 8.2 million of cash due to the sale of a MRB; 

A decrease of 44.0 million of cash due to less proceeds from the sale of investments in unconsolidated entities; and 

A decrease of 10.4 million of cash due to greater contributions to unconsolidated entities. 

Cash provided by financing activities totaled 25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used of 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change between periods was primarily due to the following factors: 
 A decrease of 25.0 million due to less proceeds from mortgages payable; 

A decrease of 13.0 million of cash related to less proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Units; 

An increase of 10.0 million of cash related to lower redemptions of Preferred Units; 

A net increase of 50.0 million of cash due to an increase in borrowing on the secured lines of credit; 

A net increase of 24.9 million of cash due to greater proceeds from debt financing; 

An increase of 5.2 million of cash due to lower distributions paid; and 

An increase of 1.5 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of BUCs. 

We believe our cash balance and cash provided by the sources discussed herein will be sufficient to pay, or refinance, our debt obligations and to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. 
 Leverage Ratio 
 We set target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us. Those constraints are dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to mark-to-market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financed collateral. We use target constraints for each type of financing to manage to an overall 80 maximum Leverage Ratio, as established by the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager. The Board of Managers of Greystone 
 97 

Manager retains the right to change the maximum Leverage Ratio in the future based on the consideration of factors the Board of Managers considers relevant. We calculate our Leverage Ratio as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using cost adjusted for paydowns for MRBs, GILs, property loans, taxable MRBs and taxable GILs, and initial cost for deferred financing costs and real estate assets. As of September 30, 2024, our overall Leverage Ratio was approximately 74 . 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held MRB, GIL, taxable MRB, taxable GIL and certain property loan investments that are secured by affordable multifamily and seniors housing properties and one commercial property, which are owned by entities that are not controlled by us. We have no equity interest in these entities and do not guarantee any obligations of these entities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we own noncontrolling equity interests in various unconsolidated entities for the development of market rate multifamily and seniors housing properties. We account for these equity interests using the equity method of accounting and the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the underlying entities are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
 We have entered into various financial commitments and guaranties. For additional discussions related to commitments and guaranties, see Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties, other than those disclosed in Note 19 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Community Investments 
 The Partnership has invested and intends to invest in assets which are and will be purchased in order to support underlying community development activities targeted to low- and moderate-income individuals, such as affordable housing, small business lending, and job creating activities in areas of the United States. These investments may be eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA and available for allocation to holders of our Preferred Units (see Note 17 to Partnership's condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 98 

The following table sets forth the assets of the Partnership the General Partner believes are eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA and are available for allocation to Preferred Unit investors as of November 5, 2024:

(1) The date reflects the stated contractual maturity of the Partnership s senior debt investment in the property. For various reasons, including, but not limited to, call provisions that can be exercised by both the borrower and the Partnership, such debt investments may be redeemed prior to the stated maturity date. The Partnership may also elect to sell certain debt investments prior to the contractual maturity, consistent with its strategic purposes. 

(2) The Partnership committed to provide total funding of MRBs up to 79.0 million and a taxable MRB up to 9.4 million during the construction and lease-up of the property on a draw-down basis. The taxable MRB has a maturity date of 12/1/2025 with an option to extend the maturity six months if stabilization has not occurred. Upon stabilization of the property, the MRBs will be partially repaid and the maximum balance of the MRBs after stabilization will not exceed 35.3 million and will have a maturity date of 12/1/2040. 

(3) The Partnership committed to provide total funding of MRBs up to 64.0 million and a taxable MRB up to 8.0 million during the acquisition and rehabilitation phase of the property on a draw-down basis. The taxable MRB has a maturity date of 4/1/2025 with an option to extend the maturity six months if stabilization 

99 

has not occurred. Upon stabilization of the property, the MRB will be partially repaid and the maximum balance of the MRB after stabilization will not exceed 44.1 million and will have a maturity date of 3/31/2040. 

(4) The Partnership committed to provide total funding of an MRB up to 41.0 million during the acquisition and rehabilitation phase of the property on a draw-down basis. Upon stabilization of the property, the MRB will be partially repaid and the maximum balance of the MRB after stabilization will not exceed 23.1 million and will have a maturity date of 4/1/2039. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The primary components of our market risk as of September 30, 2024 are related to interest rate risk and credit risk. Our exposure to market risks relates primarily to our investments in MRBs, GILs, property loans and our debt financing and mortgage payable. We seek to actively manage these and other risks and to acquire and hold assets that we believe justify bearing those risks, and to maintain capital levels consistent with those risks. 
 The current interest rate environment, the recent inflationary environment, and the risk of a potential recession have contributed to heightened market risk. See the information under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate by 0.50 in September 2024, which was the first reduction in the federal funds rate since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March 2022 to combat inflation. The Federal Reserve continues to evaluate economic data in assessing whether to make further changes to the federal funds rate, which in turn, influences market expectations for current and future interest rate levels. Changes in short-term interest rates will generally result in similar changes in the interest cost associated with our variable debt financing arrangements, though such changes are expected to be offset by changes in net receipts on our interest rate swap portfolio. 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. The nature of our MRB, GIL, and property loan investments and the debt used to finance these investments, exposes us to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The majority of our MRB investments bear interest at fixed rates. Our GIL, taxable GIL, and property loan investments bear interest at either variable rates subject to interest rate floors or fixed interest rates. 
 We regularly hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates where we have financed fixed rate investment assets with variable rate debt financing by executing SOFR-denominated interest rate swaps. Though the variable rate indices of our debt financing and interest rate swaps may differ, the interest rate swaps have effectively synthetically fixed the interest rate of the related debt financing. The majority of our variable-rate debt financings that are hedged through interest rate swaps have interest that is tax-exempt to the senior securities holders. In order to account for the differential between our interest rate swaps which are indexed to SOFR (a taxable rate) and our debt financing rate (which is correlated to short-term tax-exempt municipal securities rates), we assume that, over the term of our debt financing, the tax-exempt senior securities interest rate will approximate 70 of the SOFR rate. This assumption aligns with common market assumptions and the historical correlation between taxable and tax-exempt municipal short-term securities rates. However, such ratio may not be accurate in the short term or long term in the future. 
 The following table sets forth information regarding the impact on our net interest income assuming various changes in short-term interest rates as of September 30, 2024:

(1) The net interest income change per BUC calculated based on 23,085,261 BUCs outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

The interest rate sensitivity table above (the Table represents the change in interest income from investments, net of interest on debt and settlement payments for interest rate derivatives over the next twelve months, assuming an immediate parallel shift in the SOFR yield curve and the resulting implied forward rates are realized as a component of this shift in the curve. The table does not reflect any non-cash unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps caused by the assumed changes in interest rates. Assumptions include anticipated interest rates; relationships between different interest rate indices such as SOFR and SIFMA; and outstanding investment, 
 100 

debt financing and interest rate derivative positions. No assurance can be made that the assumptions included in the Table presented herein will occur or that other events will not occur that will affect the outcomes of the analysis. Furthermore, the results included in the Table assume we do not act to change our sensitivity to the movement in interest rates. As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of September 30, 2024, it does not consider those exposures or positions that have arisen or could arise after that date, including the various debt financing transactions that occurred in October and November 2024 and are disclosed in Note 25 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The ultimate economic impact of these market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our risk mitigation strategies at that time and the overall business and economic environment. 
 We employ leverage to fund the acquisition of many of our fixed income assets. Approximately 71 of our leverage bears interest at short term variable interest rates. Our remaining 29 of leverage has fixed interest rates. Of those assets funded with short term variable rate debt facilities, approximately 19 bear interest at a variable rate as well. While there is some basis risk between the interest cost associated with our debt financing arrangements and the short-term interest rate indices on our variable rate assets, this portion of our portfolio is substantially match funded with rising short term interest rates having a minimal impact on our net interest income. 
 For those fixed rate assets where we have variable rate funding, hedging instruments such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps have been utilized to hedge some, but not all, of the potential increases in our funding cost that would result from higher short term interest rates. In some cases, these positions have been hedged to their expected maturity date. In others, a shorter-term hedge has been executed due to uncertainty regarding the time period over which the individual fixed rate asset might be outstanding. 
 For information on our debt financing and interest rate derivatives see Notes 13 and 15, respectively. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our primary credit risk is the risk of default on our investment in MRBs, GILs and property loans collateralized by multifamily residential, seniors housing and skilled nursing properties. The MRB and GIL investments are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issue the MRB or GIL and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any issuer. In addition, the MRB, GIL and the associated property loan investments are non-recourse obligations of the property owner. As a result, the primary sources of principal and interest payments on our MRB, GIL and property loan investments are the net operating cash flows generated by these properties or the net proceeds from a sale or refinance of these properties. Affiliates of the borrowers of our GIL and construction financing property loan investments have full to limited guaranties of construction completion and payment of principal and accrued interest on the GIL and property loan investments, so we may have additional recourse options for these investments. 
 If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on our MRB, GIL or property loan investments, a default may occur. A property s ability to generate net operating cash flows is subject to a variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of its operating expenses. Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, multifamily residential, single-family rentals, seniors housing and skilled nursing properties in the market area where the property is located. This is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes. In addition, factors such as government regulation (e.g. zoning laws and permitting requirements), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor issues, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a multifamily residential property. Rental rates for set-aside units at affordable multifamily properties are typically tied to certain percentages of AMI. Increases in AMI are not necessarily correlated to inflationary increases in property operating expenses. A significant mismatch between AMI growth and increased property operating expenses could negatively impact net operating cash flows available to pay debt service. If AMI declines on a year-over-year basis, rents could need to be reduced. 
 Certain MRB, GIL, and construction financing property loan investments that fund the construction of new affordable multifamily properties may have variable interest rates. Since there are little to no operating cash flows during the construction and lease-up periods for new properties, borrowers utilize capitalized interest reserves to fund debt service prior to stabilization. Increases in market interest rates will cause an increase in debt service costs where variable rate financing is used. If interest rate increases are large enough, such capitalized interest reserves and other budgeted contingencies may be insufficient to pay all debt service through stabilization. Such cost overruns may cause defaults on our construction financing investments if other funding sources are not available to the borrowers or if related guarantors fail to meet their obligations. 
 101 

Defaults on our MRB, GIL, or property loan investments may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to Unitholders. In addition, if a property s net operating cash flow declines, it may affect the market value of the property, which may result in net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property to be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of our MRB, GIL or property loan investment. In the event of a default, we will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust on the property securing the investment. If we take ownership of the property securing a defaulted MRB or GIL investment, we will be entitled to all net operating cash flows generated by the property and will be subject to risks associated with ownership of multifamily real estate. If such an event occurs, these investments will not provide tax-exempt income. In the event of default, we will likely be required to repay debt secured by our investment using available liquidity or arrange alternative financing, if available, which is likely to be at less favorable terms. Such occurrences will negatively impact our overall available liquidity. 
 We actively manage the credit risks associated with our MRB, GIL, and property loan investments by performing a comprehensive due diligence and underwriting process of the sponsors, owners and the properties securing these investments prior to investing. In addition, we carefully monitor the on-going performance of the properties underlying these investments. For those investments where Freddie Mac has provided a forward commitment to purchase our GILs, the investment has also passed Freddie Mac s required underwriting requirements. 
 Credit risk is also present in the geographical concentration of the properties securing our MRB investments. We have significant geographic concentrations in Texas, California, and South Carolina. The table below summarizes the geographic concentrations in these states as a percentage of the total MRB principal outstanding:

Mortgage Revenue Bonds Sensitivity Analysis 
 Third-party pricing services are used to value our MRB investments. The pricing service uses a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis which encompasses judgment in its application. The key assumption in the yield to maturity or call analysis is the range of effective yields of the individual MRB investments. The effective yield analysis for each MRB considers the current market yield of similar securities, specific terms of each MRB, and various characteristics of the property collateralizing the MRB such as debt service coverage ratio, loan to value, and other characteristics. The effective yield for each MRB has historically trended with, although is not directly influenced by, medium and long-term interest rate movements. Our valuation service provider uses tax-exempt and taxable housing curves published by Municipal Market Data to estimate the value of our MRB investments. Our valuation service provider primarily uses the A rated Tax Exempt Housing Sector Yield Curve, which increased by an average of 12 basis points across the curve as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The 10 year and 30 year United States Treasury yield decreased 7 basis points and increased 11 basis points, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024. The 5 year and 10 year SOFR swap rate decreased 28 and 16 basis points, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024. These interest rate changes have a direct effect on the market value of our MRB portfolio, but do not directly impact a borrower's ability to meet its obligations as our MRB investments have predominantly fixed interest rates. 
 We completed a sensitivity analysis which is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time. The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution. The table below summarizes the sensitivity analysis metrics related to our MRB investments as of September 30, 2024:

Real Estate Valuation Risk 
 Our JV Equity Investments fund the construction, stabilization and sale of market-rate multifamily real estate. The realizable property values for such investments are primarily dependent upon the value of a property to prospective buyers at the time of its sale, which may be impacted by, market cap rates, the operating results of the property, local market conditions and competition, and interest rates on mortgage financing. We have noticed market cap rates are trending upward due to, though not limited to, the current economic environment and increasing interest rates. We have also noted that rental rates may be decreasing in certain markets, which would lower property operating results leading to a reduction in property valuations. Operating results of real estate properties may be affected by many factors, such as the number of tenants, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, debt 
 102 

service requirements, competition from other similar multifamily rental properties and general and local economic conditions. In addition, all outstanding financing directly secured by such real estate properties must be repaid upon sale. Lower sales proceeds may prevent us from collecting our accrued preferred return or the return of our original investment equity, which would result in realized losses on our investments. 
 Reinvestment Risk 
 MRB investments may have optional call features that may be exercised by either the borrower or the Partnership that are earlier than the contractual maturity. These optional call features may be at either par or premiums to par. In addition, our GIL and most property loan investments are prepayable at any time without penalty. Borrowers may choose to redeem our investments if prevailing market interest rates are lower than the interest rate on our investment asset or for other reasons. In order to maintain or grow our investment portfolio size and earnings, we must reinvest repayment proceeds in new assets. New MRB, GIL and property loan investment opportunities may not generate the same returns as our current investments such that our reported operating results may decline over time. In addition, rising interest rates and construction costs could limit the ability of developers to initiate new projects for us to finance with MRB, GIL, and property loan investments. 
 Similarly, we are subject to reinvestment risk on the return of capital from sales of JV Equity Investments. Our strategy involves making JV Equity Investments for the development, stabilization and sale of market-rate multifamily rental properties. Our initial equity contributions are returned upon sale of the underlying properties, at which time we will look to reinvest the capital into new JV Equity Investments or other investments. Fewer new investment opportunities may result from negative changes in various economic factors and those new investments that we do make may not generate the same returns as our prior investments due to factors including, but not limited to, increasing competition in the development of market-rate multifamily rental properties, rising interest rates on construction loans and increasing construction costs. We have observed declining availability of credit and tighter credit underwriting standards for banks that provide construction financing for our JV Equity Investments, which may result in lower loan proceeds and higher rates on construction loans in the near-term such that new investment profitability is negatively impacted or more difficult to originate. Lower returns on new investment opportunities will result in declining operating results over time. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
