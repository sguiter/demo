 of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based primarily on the fact that (1) changes in fair value were caused primarily by fluctuations in interest rates, (2)
 securities with unrealized losses had generally high credit quality, (3) the Company intends to hold these investments in debt securities to maturity and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments
 before a recovery of its investment, and (4) issuers have continued to make timely payments of principal and interest. Additionally, the Company s state and political subdivision securities are rated AA or better and the Company receives a
 surveillance report that is reviewed quarterly for indications of credit concerns. The Company s mortgage-backed securities are entirely issued by either U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Collectively, these

 Company s corporate bonds and other securities portfolio issuers consist of bank holding companies that are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Company s credit department for indications of declining credit quality.

models. The first model used by the Company s bond accounting service provider, determines the fair value of securities. Securities are priced based on an evaluation of observable market data, including benchmark yield curves, reported trades,
 broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Pricing is also impacted by credit information about the issuer, perceived market movements, and current news events impacting the individual sectors. The second source is a third-party vendor the
 Company utilizes to provide fair value exit pricing for loans and interest-bearing deposits in accordance with guidance. 
 
 In accordance with ASC 820, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value into three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the
 assumptions used to determine fair value.

 The Company enters into interest rate swaps with certain qualifying commercial loan
 customers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The Company simultaneously enters into interest rate swaps with dealer counterparties, with identical notional amounts and offsetting terms. These back-to-back loan swaps are
 derivative financial instruments and are reported at fair value in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of loan swaps are recorded in other noninterest income and sum to zero
 because of the offsetting terms of swaps with borrowers and swaps with dealer counterparties. All of the Company s interest rate swaps on loans are classified as Level 2. 
 
 Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held for sale consist of residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for
 similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). Gains and losses on the sale of loans are reported on a separate line item on the Company s

 securities, fees earned on deposit accounts, debit card interchange, and treasury and commercial services. Wealth s operating revenues consist principally of income from fiduciary and asset management fees. The Parent s revenues are mainly
 interest and dividends received from the Bank and Wealth. The Company has no other segments. The Company s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately because each
 segment appeals to different markets and, accordingly, requires different technologies and marketing strategies.

Index 

Book value per share and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) at September 30, 2024 increased 15.10 and 15.45 , respectively from September 30, 2023.

Net income improved 1.0 million, or 74.9 , to 2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income improved 381 thousand, or 6.1 , to
 6.6 million compared to 6.2 million for the same period in 2023.

Net interest margin (NIM) was 3.56 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.33 for the third quarter of 2023. NIM on a fully tax-equivalent basis (FTE) (non-GAAP) was 3.57 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.35 for the
 third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NIM was 3.54 and NIM on an FTE was 3.55 compared to 3.67 and 3.68 for the same period in 2023.

Net interest income increased 884 thousand, or 7.7 , to 12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 372 thousand, or
 1.0 to 36.0 million compared to 36.3 million for the same period in 2023.

Provision for credit losses of 282 thousand was recognized for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 505 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provision for credit losses was 623

Capital Management and Dividends

Total equity was 115.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 106.8 million at December 31, 2023. Total equity increased 8.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, due primarily to
 net income and lower unrealized losses in the market value of securities available-for-sale, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by cash dividend payments. The unrealized loss in market
 value of securities available-for-sale was a result of increases in market interest rates since the securities were acquired, rather than credit quality issues. The Company does not expect these unrealized losses to affect the earnings or
 regulatory capital of the Company or its subsidiaries.

For the third quarter of 2024, the Company declared dividends of 0.14 per share, consistent with the third quarter of 2023. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, dividends declared were 0.42
 per share. The dividend represents a payout ratio of 32.1 of EPS for the first nine months of 2024. The Board of Directors of the Company continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light
 of changes in economic conditions, current and future capital requirements, and expected future earnings. The Company s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support the Company s risk profile
 consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide a competitive return to stockholders.
 Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital for the Bank are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. See Table 14. Regulatory Capital 
 below for additional information.

At September 30, 2024, the book value per share of the Company s common stock was 22.74, and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was 22.38, compared to 19.75 and 19.39, respectively, at September 30, 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company s financial
 position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions, and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues,
 expenses, and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. Those accounting policies with the
 greatest uncertainty and that require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the greatest likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different
 conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below.

For further information on the Company s critical accounting estimates, refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and under
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in its 2023 Form 10-K.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans

The ACLL represents the estimated balance the Company considers adequate to absorb expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loan portfolio. The ACLL is estimated using a loan-level
 discounted cash flows method for all loans with the exception of its automobile, farmland, and consumer portfolios. For the automobile, farmland, and consumer portfolios, the Company has elected to pool those loans based on similar risk
 characteristics to determine the ACLL using the remaining life method.

Determining the appropriateness of the ACLL is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in
 light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the ACLL in future periods. There are both internal factors (i.e., loan balances, credit quality, and the contractual lives of loans) and external factors (i.e., economic
 conditions such as trends in interest rates, GDP, inflation, and unemployment) that can impact the ACLL estimate.

For instance, the Company considers the Virginia and regional unemployment rate as an external economic variable in developing the ACLL. The quantitative ACLL estimate is sensitive to changes in the unemployment
 rate. Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the ACLL, could change
 significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall ACLL because changes in those factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all
 loan types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others.

The Company reviews its ACLL estimation process regularly for appropriateness as the economic and internal environment are constantly changing. While the ACLL estimate represents management s current estimate of
 expected credit losses, due to uncertainty surrounding internal and external factors, there is potential that the estimate may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio. While management uses available information to
 estimate expected losses on loans, future changes in the ACLL may be necessary based on changes in portfolio composition, portfolio credit quality, economic conditions, and/or other factors.

For further information on the Company s critical accounting estimates, refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in its 2023 Form 10-K.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income

The principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest and fees generated by earning assets and interest expense paid to fund them. Changes
 in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. The NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income
 by average earning assets, or on a fully tax-equivalent basis, tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 12.3 million, an increase of 884 thousand, or 7.7 , from the third quarter of 2023. The increase from the prior year
 quarter was due primarily to higher average earning asset balances at higher average yields partially offset by higher average rates on interest-bearing liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net interest income was
 36.0 million and 36.3 million, respectively. The decrease from the prior-year comparative period was due to higher average-interest bearing liabilities at higher average rates, partially offset by higher average earning assets at higher average
 earning yields.

29 

Index 

Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), was 12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 879 thousand from the 2023 comparative quarter. For the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), was 36.1 million and 36.5 million, respectively. NIM for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.56 , an increase from 3.33 for the prior year quarter.
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, NIM was 3.54 and 3.67 , respectively. On a fully tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), NIM was 3.57 and 3.55 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
 3.35 and 3.68 for the respective prior year comparative periods. For more information on these FTE financial measures, please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

Average earning asset balances for the third quarter of 2024 increased 12.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 with yields on average earning assets increasing 34 basis points due to
 deployment of liquidity into higher earning assets and the effects of the rising interest rate environment. During the first nine months of 2024, average earning assets increased 27.4 million over the 2023 comparative period.

Average loans decreased 49.0 million, or 4.5 , and 18.4 million, or 1.7 , for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. The decrease in
 average loans outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023 was due primarily to reduction in size of the commercial and industrial, commercial - owner occupied, and consumer automobile segments of the loan portfolio. Average loan yields were higher for
 the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 by 41 basis points and 42 basis points, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023 due primarily to the effects of rising interest rates.

Average securities available-for-sale decreased 12.1 million and 20.2 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to fluctuations
 in fair market value, maturities, and principal paydowns. The average yield on the investment securities portfolio increased 7 basis points and 20 basis points for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the
 same periods in 2023 due primarily to the effects of rising interest rates on the Company s variable rate investment securities portfolio.

Average interest-bearing deposits in other banks, consisting primarily of excess cash reserves maintained at the FRB, increased 74.0 million and 65.8 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024,
 compared to the respective periods in 2023 due primarily to deployment of liquidity into higher yielding assets. Due to changes in interest rates, the average yield on interest-bearing deposits in other banks decreased 1 basis point for the third
 quarter and increased 21 basis points for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The FRB interest rate on excess cash reserve balances was 4.90 at September 30, 2024.

Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 8.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, with costs increasing 21 basis points. The higher interest cost of
 liabilities was primarily due to higher interest rates on money market and time deposits, partially offset by decreases in short term average FHLB advances during the period. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 45.1 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, with costs increasing 69 basis points. The higher interest cost of liabilities was primarily driven by higher average balances and interest rates on money market and a
 higher average balance on interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by decreases in short-term average FHLB advances during the period. Average money market and interest-bearing demand deposits increased 39.8 million for the third
 quarter while average money market, time, and interest-bearing demand deposits increased 81.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased
 12.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 24.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 38 basis points for the third quarter of 2024
 and 87 basis points for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to higher rates on deposits driven by depositors seeking increased yields and competitive pricing pressures. While changes in rates take
 effect immediately for interest checking, money market and savings accounts, changes in the average cost of time deposits lag changes in pricing based on the repricing of time deposits at maturity and the pace with which customers move funds from
 other deposit products into or out of time deposit products. The extent to which changing interest rates will ultimately affect the Company s NIM is uncertain.

Interest income and expense are affected by fluctuations in interest rates, by changes in volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and by the interaction of rate and volume
 factors. The following table shows the direct causes of the period-to-period changes in the components of net interest income. The Company calculates the rate and volume variances using a formula prescribed by the SEC. Rate/volume variances, the
 third element in the calculation, are not shown separately in the table, but are allocated to the rate and volume variances in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of each.

The Company believes NIM may be affected in future periods by several factors that are difficult to predict, including (1) changes in interest rates, which may depend on the severity of adverse economic conditions,
 inflationary pressures, the timing and extent of any economic recovery, which are inherently uncertain; (2) possible changes in the composition of earning assets which may result from decreased loan demand as a result of the current economic
 environment; and (3) possible changes in the composition of interest-bearing liabilities, which may result from decreased deposit balances or increased competition for deposits, or from changes in the availability of certain types of wholesale
 funding.

Provision for Credit Losses

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a provision for credit losses of 282 thousand compared to 505 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
 provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 included a provision for loans of 342 thousand and a 60 thousand recovery for unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses was 623 thousand for the first nine months of 2024,
 compared to 1.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. Charged-off loans totaled 1.5 million and 1.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Recoveries amounted to 409 thousand and 526 thousand for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s annualized net loans charged off to average loans were 0.18 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.09 for the third quarter of 2023. The decreased provision for credit
 losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to the reduction in size of the loan portfolio.

The state of the local economy can have a significant impact on the level of loan charge-offs. If the economy begins to contract, nonperforming assets could increase as a result of declines in real
 estate values or increases in unemployment rates and financial stress on borrowers. Increased nonperforming assets would increase charge-offs and reduce earnings due to larger contributions to the provision for credit losses.

34 

Index 

Noninterest Income

Total noninterest income was 3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, decreasing 10 thousand compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease over the prior year quarter
 was primarily driven by decreases in mortgage banking income, partially offset by increases in fiduciary and asset management fees. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 215 thousand to 10.2 million compared
 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in mortgage banking income and no gain on sales of fixed assets, partially offset by increases in fiduciary and asset management fees and service charges on deposit
 accounts. The decrease in mortgage banking income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was due to declines in the volume of mortgage originations attributable to the Company s strategic shift in
 mortgage lending and changes in mortgage market conditions impacting the industry as a whole.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense totaled 12.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 12.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by
 decreases in salaries and employee benefit expense and other operating expenses, partially offset by increases in professional services. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of
 2023 was primarily driven by lower average headcount due to the previously reported cost saving initiatives. The noninterest expense reduction initiatives reduced the employee headcount beginning late in the first quarter of 2024 and continuing
 through the third quarter by approximately 12 , partially offset by expenses related to severance. The increase in professional services included the settlement of two outstanding legal matters. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
 noninterest expense decreased 775 thousand over the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits as discussed above.

Income Tax Expense

The Company s income tax expense increased 564 thousand and 426 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to changes in the
 levels of pre-tax income, the mix of effective tax-exempt income, and the adoption of ASU 2023-02. The effective federal income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.3 and 18.0 compared to 10.5 and 14.2 for
 the same periods in 2023. The increase in the effective federal income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, was driven primarily by the adoption of ASU 2023-02.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 1.5 billion, an increase of 31.6 million compared to assets at December 31, 2023.

Net loans held for investment decreased 54.0 million or 5.1 , from December 31, 2023 to 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024, driven by the following: decreases in consumer loans of 31.4 million,
 construction loans of 16.6 million, commercial loans of 12.2 million, and commercial real estate loans of 3.4 million, partially offset by increases in residential real estate loans of 8.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased 96.0
 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Securities available-for-sale, at fair value, decreased 8.4 million from December 31, 2023 to 193.8 million at September 30, 2024 driven primarily by maturities, principal pay downs, and
 fluctuations in fair market values.

Total deposits of 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased 52.4 million, or 4.3 from December 31, 2023. Time deposits increased 21.1 million, or 8.7 , noninterest-bearing deposits
 increased 21.1 million, or 6.4 , and savings deposits increased 10.2 million, or 1.5 . The increased deposit balances were primarily driven by increases from large commercial customers.

The Company utilizes FHLB advances as a primary source of liquidity as needed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had FHLB advances of 40.0 million and 69.5 million,
 respectively. Overnight repurchase agreements decreased 606 thousand as the Company used excess liquidity to pay down high cost borrowed funds.

Securities Portfolio

When comparing September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023, securities available-for-sale decreased 8.4 million, or 4.2 , driven primarily by maturities, principal pay downs and fluctuations in fair
 market values. The Company s strategy for the securities portfolio is primarily intended to manage the portfolio s susceptibility to interest rate risk and to provide liquidity to fund loan growth. The securities portfolio is also adjusted to
 achieve other asset/liability objectives, including pledging requirements, and to manage tax exposure when necessary.

Management believes the Company has strong credit quality review processes in place to identify problem loans quickly. For a detailed discussion of the Company s nonperforming assets, refer to Part
 I, Item 1, Financial Statements under the heading Note 3. Loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Allowance for Credit Losses

As of September 30, 2024, the ACL was 11.9 million and included an ACLL of 11.7 million and an allowance for unfunded commitments of 248 thousand. The decrease in the ACL during the
 first nine months of 2024 was due to the reduction in the size of the loan portfolio, primarily due to declines in commercial and industrial of 12.2 million, real estate construction of 16.8 million,
 and consumer of 31.4 million. The following table summarizes the ACL as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Index 

The ACLL represents an amount that, in management s judgement, will be adequate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan portfolio; however, if elevated levels of risk are identified, provision
 for credit losses may increase in future periods. The following tables present the Company s loan loss experience for the periods indicated:

(2) The consumer segment included consumer automobile loans.

(3) The real estate-commercial segment included commercial-owner occupied and commercial-non-owner occupied.

The Company s real estate-commercial portfolio consists of loans secured by a mortgage lien on real property and, if owner occupied, carries risks associated with the successful operation of a business or, if
 non-owner occupied, carries risks associated with the profitability and cash flow from rent receipts. The borrower s cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, a downturn in the local economy or, if non-owner
 occupied, a downturn in occupancy rates or market rental rates in the market where the property is located. Included in the Company s real estate-commercial loan segment are loans secured by office buildings, which had an aggregate principal
 balance of 52.2 million at September 30, 2024 (the Office Portfolio ). Due to the evolving office space market conditions, we have additional monitoring processes for the Office Portfolio, which can include periodic credit risk assessments of
 borrowers, guarantors, and significant lessees, as well as periodic reviews of the local office rental markets. Based on analyses of the Office Portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has identified two loans secured by office buildings
 with respect to which the Company has begun enhanced credit administration efforts to support the Company s objective of maintaining a portfolio of quality credits and quickly identifying potential weaknesses as discussed further below.

The total principal balance of loans 30-59 days past due and still accruing interest increased to 15.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million at December 31, 2023. This is primarily
 related to two loans secured by office buildings with respect to which the Company has begun enhanced credit administration efforts to support the Company s objective of maintaining a portfolio of quality credits and quickly identifying potential
 weaknesses, and the Company classified as OAEM at September 30, 2024. Each office building securing each such loan is now administered by a court appointed receivership. The receivers have control over all respective rental income and have made
 debt service payments for each loan for three consecutive months. The Company believes the net cash flow from each office building is adequate to repay each loan secured by that collateral. For further discussion, see Item 2. Management's
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Table 6: Loan Portfolio .

Deposits

The Company s predominant source of funds is depository accounts, which are comprised of demand deposits, savings and money market accounts and time deposits. The Company s deposits are principally provided by
 individuals and businesses located within the communities served.

Index 

As of September 30, 2024, total deposits were 1.3 billion, an increase of 52.4 million, or 4.3 , compared to December 31, 2023. The following table presents average balances and average rates paid on deposits for

The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits by the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.31 compared to 1.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average balances of interest
 bearing, money market, and time deposits increased from the same period in the prior year, totaling 19.1 million, 17.7 million, and 44.3 million, respectively, while average balances of savings and demand deposits decreased 21.3 million and
 24.1 million as seen in the table above. The increase in money market and time deposits was driven in part by depositors seeking increased yields. The Company remains focused on increasing lower-cost deposits by actively targeting new
 noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated amounts of total uninsured deposits were approximately 229.8 million and 220.3 million, respectively, or 17.9 of total deposits for both periods. The
 following table shows maturities of the estimated amounts of uninsured time deposits as of September 30, 2024. The estimate of uninsured deposits generally represents deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000 and is
 calculated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for purposes of the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements.

Capital Resources

Total stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024 was 115.5 million, up 8.1 from 106.8 million on December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily related to higher net income and lower unrealized losses in the
 market value of securities available-for-sale, which are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by cash dividend payments. The unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale were a result of
 increases in market interest rates since the securities were acquired, rather than credit quality issues. The Company does not expect these unrealized losses to affect the earnings or regulatory capital of the Company or its subsidiaries.

The assessment of capital adequacy depends on such factors as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, and changing competitive conditions and economic forces. The adequacy of the Company s and the Bank s
 capital is regularly reviewed. The Company targets regulatory capital levels that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses. While the Company will continue to look for
 opportunities to invest capital in profitable growth, the Company will also consider investing capital in other transactions, such as share repurchases, that facilitate improving shareholder return, as measured by ROE and EPS.

41 

Index 

The Bank s capital position remains strong as evidenced by the regulatory capital measurements. Under the banking regulations, Total Capital is composed of core capital (Tier 1) and supplemental capital (Tier 2).
 Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity less goodwill. Tier 2 capital consists of certain qualifying debt and a qualifying portion of the ACL. In addition, the Bank has made the one-time irrevocable election to continue treating
 accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) under regulatory standards that were in place prior to the Basel III Capital Rules in order to eliminate volatility of regulatory capital that can result from fluctuations in accumulated other
 comprehensive income (loss) and the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in regulatory capital, as would otherwise be required under the Basel III Capital Rule. As a result of this election, changes in accumulated other
 comprehensive income (loss), including unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, do not affect regulatory capital amounts shown in the table below for the Bank, but transactions that would cause the Bank to realize such unrealized
 losses would affect such regulatory capital amounts.

Pursuant to applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, the Company is treated as a small bank holding company and will not be subject to regulatory capital requirements. For more information, refer to
 Regulation and Supervision included in Item 1, Business of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K.

On September 17, 2019, the FDIC finalized a rule that introduces an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations (i.e., the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR)
 framework), as required by the EGRRCPA. The CBLR framework is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the
 framework.

In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9 , less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, and limited amounts of
 off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio
 requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. The CBLR framework was available for banks to begin using in their March 31, 2020, Call Report. The Bank did not opt
 into the CBLR framework.

The following is a summary of the Bank s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As shown below, these ratios were all well above the recommended regulatory minimum levels.

The Basel III Capital Rules established a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, which is not included in the table above. Including the
 capital conservation buffer, the minimum ratios are a Common Equity Tier 1 capital risk-based ratio of 7.0 percent, a Tier 1 capital risk-based ratio of 8.5 percent, and a Total capital risk-based ratio of 10.5 percent. The Bank exceeded these
 ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

On July 14, 2021, the Company issued 30.0 million 29.4 million, net of issuance costs) of 3.5 percent fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031 (the Notes) in a private placement transaction. The Notes
 initially bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.5 percent for five years and convert to three-month SOFR plus 286 basis points, resetting quarterly, thereafter. The Notes were structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital of the Company for regulatory
 purposes (should the Company be subject to regulatory capital requirements) and are included in the Company s Tier 2 capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Liquidity

Liquidity is the ability of the Company to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through
 liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, investments in securities and loans maturing within one year. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Company include cash flows
 from operations, loan payments and payoffs, deposit growth, maturities, calls and sales of securities, the issuance of brokered certificates of deposits and the capacity to borrow additional funds.

A major source of the Company s liquidity is its large, stable deposit base. In addition, secondary liquidity sources are available through the use of borrowed funds if the need should arise,
 including secured advances from the FHLB and FRB. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 424.3 million in total FHLB borrowing availability based on loans and securities currently available for pledging and of that amount, the Company's
 remaining availability totaled 384.3 million. The Company believes that the availability at the FHLB is sufficient to meet future cash-flow needs. The Company also has available short-term, unsecured borrowed funds in the form of federal funds
 lines of credit with correspondent banks.

42 

Index 

Based on the Company s management of liquid assets, the availability of borrowed funds and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains
 overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers future borrowing needs. The Bank also participates in the IntraFi Cash Sweep, a product which provides the Bank the capability of providing additional
 deposit insurance to customers through three types of account arrangements. The Company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in the Company s markets. The
 Company is closely monitoring changes in the industry and market conditions that may affect the Company s liquidity, including the potential impacts on the Company s liquidity of declines in the fair value of the Company s securities portfolio as
 a result of rising market interest rates and developments in the financial services industry that may change the availability of traditional sources of liquidity or market expectations with respect to available sources and amounts of additional
 liquidity. Depending on its liquidity levels, its capital position, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity, other securities or other possible capital markets
 transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for the Company s operations.

The following table sets forth information relating to the Company s sources of liquidity and the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity as of September 30, 2024. Dividing the total short-term sources of
 liquidity by the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity derives the liquidity coverage ratio.

As a result of the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding and management of liquid assets, management believes the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy operational requirements
 and contractual obligations. The Company s internal sources of liquidity are deposits, loan and investment repayments and securities available-for-sale. The Company s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the FHLB.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. As of September 30, 2024, there
 have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business as disclosed in the Company s contractual obligations disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In reporting the results as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP in the United States and prevailing
 practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of the Company s performance which include financial measures presented on a tax equivalent, tangible, or adjusted basis.

43 

Index 

Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information about operating performance by enhancing comparability with other financial periods, other financial institutions, and
 between different sources of interest income. The non-GAAP measures used by management enhance comparability by excluding the effects of balances of intangible assets, including goodwill, that vary significantly between institutions, and tax
 benefits that are not consistent across different opportunities for investment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition,
 the Company s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company s performance to the
 most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Market Risk Management

Effectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the Company's financial objectives. Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market
 prices. The Company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk. The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk; however, market risk also includes liquidity risk. Both are discussed in the
 following sections.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by the ALCO
 and Board of Directors, both of which receive and review periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk position.

The Company uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the
 scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates numerous assumptions including growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and
 paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.

46 

Index 

A balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets (loans and securities) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities (deposits and borrowings). An asset sensitive
 balance sheet will produce relatively more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline. Based on the Company's simulation analysis, management believes the Company's interest sensitivity position at
 September 30, 2024 is slightly asset sensitive. Management makes no predictions on the direction or magnitude of future rates and seeks to maintain a relatively neutral interest rate risk profile to minimize the exposure to higher or lower market
 rates.

Earnings Simulation

The following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands), assuming instantaneous and parallel changes in
 interest rates and while maintaining a static balance sheet. Net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to decrease marginally when interest rates are shocked higher and lower from current rates.

Management cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous
 assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates
 on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.

Any changes in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity
 position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt. Decrease in yields due to the current rate environment have been projected in the model simulation.

Economic Value Simulation

Economic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash
 flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings
 capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet.

The following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the quarterly period ended September 30,
 2024 (dollars in thousands):

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of
 the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
 concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that
 it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
 the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In designing and evaluating its disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
 absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
 no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
 internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
 of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Therefore, even
 those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Changes in Internal Controls. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s third quarter ended September 30, 2024,
 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. 

Legal Proceedings.

The nature of the business of the Company ordinarily results in a certain amount of litigation. The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, all of which are considered incidental to the
 normal conduct of business. Based on information presently available, and based on consultation with legal counsel, Management believes that the outcomes of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
 position or consolidated results of operations of the Company.

Item 1A. 

Risk Factors.

An investment in the Company s securities involves risks. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the information addressed under Cautionary
 Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, investors in the Company s securities should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company s
 business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements
 contained in this report.

There have been no material changes in the risk factors faced by the Company from those disclosed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K.

Item 2. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

Pursuant to the Company s equity compensation plans, participants may pay the exercise price of certain awards or satisfy tax withholding requirements associated with awards by surrendering shares
 of the Company s common stock that the participants already own. Additionally, participants may also surrender shares upon vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy tax withholding requirements. Shares surrendered by participants of these
 plans are repurchased at current market value pursuant to the terms of the applicable awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares related to the equity compensation plan awards.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not have an effective share repurchase program that was authorized by the Company s Board of Directors.
