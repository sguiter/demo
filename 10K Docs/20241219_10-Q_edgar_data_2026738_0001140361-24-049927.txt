CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q (the Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance
 or financial condition of Fortress Credit Realty Income Trust (the Company, we, us, or our ). Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, 
 target, project, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. The forward-looking statements
 contained in this Form 10-Q may include statements as to:

our future operating results;

our business prospects and the prospects of the assets in which we may invest;

the impact of the investments that we expect to make;

our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our investment strategy;

our ability to source adequate investment opportunities to efficiently deploy capital;

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments;

the effect of global and national economic and market conditions generally upon our operating results, including, but not limited to, changes with respect to inflation, interest rate changes and supply
 chain disruptions, and changes in government rules, regulations and fiscal policies;

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital;

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our investments;

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;

actual and potential conflicts of interest with FCR Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Adviser ), or any of its affiliates;

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the assets in which we may invest;

our use of financial leverage;

the ability of the Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments;

the ability of the Adviser or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals;

our ability to structure investments in a tax-efficient manner and the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and

our tax status and the tax status and attributes of entities and assets in which we may invest.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those
 implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Registration Statement on Form 10 initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on
 September 6, 2024, as amended (the Registration Statement ). Other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include:

changes in the economy, particularly those affecting the real estate industry;

risks associated with possible disruption in our operations or the economy generally due to terrorism, natural disasters, epidemics or other events having a broad impact on the economy;

f luctuations in interest rates and credit spreads could reduce our ability to generate income on our loans and other investments, which could lead to a significant
 decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments and may limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders ;

adverse conditions in the areas where our investments or the properties underlying such investments are and may be located and local real estate conditions;

limitations on our business and our ability to satisfy requirements to maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or to maintain our qualification as a
 real estate investment trust (a REIT ), for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

certain economic events may cause our shareholders to request that we repurchase their shares, and if we decide to satisfy any or all of such requests, our cash flow and our results of operations and
 financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Further, our board of trustees may make exceptions to, modify or suspend our share repurchase plan (including to make exceptions to the repurchase limitations or purchase fewer
 shares than such repurchase limitations) if it deems such action to be in our best interest;

distributions are not guaranteed and may be funded from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, borrowings, offering proceeds (including from sales of our shares to all
 Fortress Investment Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Fortress ), affiliates, partners, members, shareholders, officers, directors and employees ), proceeds from repayments of our real estate debt investments, sales of our liquid investments and, if necessary, sales of our investments and/or assets, and we have no limits on the amounts we may fund from such sources ;

the valuation of our investments may not be certain or transparent as a result of the highly volatile environments we operate in;

the purchase and repurchase prices for our shares are generally based on our prior month s net asset value NAV and are not based on any public trading market;

future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas;

our ability to raise additional funds to enable us to make additional investments and diversify the risk profile of our portfolio;

our ability to capitalize on potential investment opportunities on attractive terms;

adverse changes in the real estate and real estate capital markets could negatively impact our performance by making it more difficult for borrowers of our mortgage loans
 to satisfy their debt payment obligations, which could result in losses on our loan investments and/or make it more difficult for us to generate consistent or attractive risk-adjusted returns ;

our ability to accurately identify or adequately evaluate potential risks in volatile investing environments with limited market liquidity or price transparency;

ii 

i ncreased competition from entities engaged in mortgage lending and/or investing in assets similar to ours may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable loans
 and investments or dispose of investments, and could also affect the yields of these investments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations ;

the advent of any future epidemics, pandemics, or any other public health crises;

risks associated with investing outside of the United States;

the incurrence of contingent liabilities as a result of our investments, including our assumption of default risk or other third-party risks;

our use of financing arrangements, including certain repurchase facilities we become a party to from time to time, seller financing, secured and unsecured leveraged and other one-off financing solutions,
 could subject us to financial covenants and other covenants that could restrict our operations;

our ability to forecast correlations between the value of our portfolio and the direction of exchange rates, interest rates and the price of securities in order to effectively or appropriately mitigate
 risks associated with our investments;

risks associated with our hedging program, including our use of options and forward trading;

defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding indebtedness;

certain risks associated with limitations on our remedies under bankruptcy laws;

system failures and cybersecurity breaches;

substantial compliance costs that may be required to meet the constantly evolving legal and regulatory landscape for data protection and privacy;

potential misconduct and unauthorized conduct from third-party providers;

our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT requires us to annually distribute at least 90 of our taxable income, and therefore, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including financing
 for acquisitions, from our operating cash flow, and may need to rely on third-party sources for capital;

compliance with state and local laws, statutes, regulations and ordinances relating to pollution, the protection of the environment and human health and safety;

risks associated with joint ventures;

risks associated with our relationship with Fortress and the Adviser; and

changes to United States federal income tax laws.

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove
 to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could also be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this Form 10-Q should not be
 regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.

iii 

You should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and have filed as exhibits hereto with the understanding that our actual
 future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
 the date of this Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

For more information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties that we face, see the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in our
 Registration Statement and any such updated factors included in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction
 with the other cautionary statements that are included in this document (or our other filings).

ITEM 2. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

References herein to we, us, our, FCR, and the Company refer to Fortress Credit Realty Income Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context
 specifically requires otherwise.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
 In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may
 differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Registration
 Statement.

Overview

Fortress Credit Realty Income Trust is a credit-focused diversified mortgage REIT, which will invest in the senior parts of the capital structure, with a focus on (i)
 floating rate loans across commercial real estate CRE debt CRE Debt and (ii) investments in real estate-related assets. We are externally managed by FCR Advisors LLC, our Adviser and an affiliate of Fortress.

The Company is a Maryland statutory trust formed on
 June 4, 2024 Date of Formation however, no activity occurred until August 2, 2024. The Company is a non-listed, perpetual life REIT that intends to make an election to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
 as amended (the Code ), for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our initial taxable year ending December 31, 2024. The Company generally will
 not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have received aggregate proceeds of 104.9 million
 from the sale of our common shares. The Company has primarily used the net proceeds to make investments in real estate debt as further described below under Investment Portfolio. The Company intends to continue selling common shares on a
 monthly basis.

Market Conditions and Trends

The Company s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial
 markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.

During the third quarter of 2024, the persistence of both elevated inflation and interest rates, in conjunction with
 geopolitical uncertainty (including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing and developing conflicts in the Middle East), and uncertainty around future capital availability continued to weigh on industry deal activity and
 market valuations.

However, industry transaction volumes increased slightly compared to the previous
 quarter and are expected to continue to grow. Our business, focused on floating rate loans across CRE debt and residential loans and assets, continued to deploy significant capital across senior components of the capital structure. Our
 investors continue to benefit from the inflation-mitigating characteristics and long term risk adjusted returns of our credit-focused diversified mortgage REIT strategy.

We are continuing to closely monitor developments related to the macroeconomic factors that have contributed to market volatility, and to assess the impact of these factors
 on financial markets and on our business. Our future results may be adversely affected by slowdowns in fundraising activity and the pace of capital deployment. It remains difficult to predict the ultimate effects of these events on the
 financial markets, overall economy, and our financial statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Operations in our Registration Statement.

Authorization of New Share Classes and Amended Offering Documents

On November 18, 2024, the Company s board of trustees authorized the Company to
 offer and sell new classes of common shares to be designated the Class J-1 common shares , Class J-2 common shares and Class J-3 common shares . The Class J-3 common shares will pay a 1.25 management fee and a 12.5 performance fee. The
 Class J-1 and Class J-2 common shares will pay a 1.00 management fee (which the Adviser has agreed to waive until March 31, 2025) and will not pay a performance fee.

On December 16, 2024, the Company s board of trustees authorized the Company to rename the previously designated Class J-3
 common shares to Class J-4 common shares and authorized the Company to offer and sell new classes of common shares to be designated the Class J-3 common shares and Class J-5 common shares . The Class J-5 common shares will pay a 1.25 
 management fee and a 12.5 performance fee. The Class J-3 common shares will pay a 1.00 management fee (which the Adviser has agreed to waive until March 31, 2025) and will not pay a performance fee.

In connection with the authorization of new share classes, the Company amended its Fourth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, Fourth

Emerging Growth Company Status

We are and will remain an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i)
 following the fifth anniversary of the date of an initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (iii) in which we
 are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the date of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have
 issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are
 applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot predict if
 investors will find our shares less attractive because we may rely on some or all of these exemptions.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
 of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We
 will take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us since our financial statements may not be
 comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

We believe we have sufficient liquidity to operate our business, with immediate liquidity comprised of cash and cash equivalents
 of 38.3 million and 500 million available under the GS Repurchase Agreement as of September 30, 2024. In addition to our immediate liquidity, we obtain incremental liquidity through the sale of our common shares, from which we generated
 proceeds of approximately 104.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we may incur indebtedness secured by our real estate and real estate debt investments, borrow money through unsecured financings, or incur other
 forms of indebtedness.

Our primary use of cash will be for (i) origination or acquisition of CRE debt and investments in real estate-related assets, (ii)
 the cost of operations (including the management fee and performance participation), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, (iv) periodic repurchases, including under our share repurchase plan, and (v) cash distributions (if any) to the holders of
 our common shares to the extent declared by our board of trustees.

Our cash needs for acquisitions and other capital investments will be funded primarily from the sale of common shares and through the incurrence or assumption of debt. We plan on fulfilling our
 outstanding commitment obligations for properties under development from the sale of common shares. Other potential future sources of capital include secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from the sale of
 assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. We continue to believe that our current liquidity position is sufficient to meet the need of our expected
 investment activity.

Capital Resources

For the period from June 4, 2024 (Date of Formation) through September 30, 2024 , we issued and sold 5,245,175 common shares, consisting of 4,350,675
 Class B shares, 250,000 Class I shares and 644,500 Class E shares to accredited investors in our private offering, amounting to proceeds of 104.9 million as payment for such shares, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution
 reinvestment plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not receive any repurchase requests for our common shares.

As of September 30, 2024, we had received aggregate proceeds of 104.9 million from the issuance and sale of common shares in our private offering and pursuant to our
 distribution reinvestment program. As of September 30, 2024, after giving effect to shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, share transfers, conversions, and redemptions we had an aggregate of 5,245,175 common shares
 outstanding, consisting of 4,350,675 Class B shares, 250,000 Class I shares and 644,500 Class E shares.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves
 significant judgments and assumptions and requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
 dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our condensed consolidated financial
 statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting policies that we believe are the most affected by our judgments, estimates, and assumptions. See Item 1. Financial Statements-Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates for further descriptions of the below accounting policies.

Fair Value Option

The guidance in ASC 825, Financial Instruments , provides a fair value option
 election that allows entities to make an irrevocable election of fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain eligible financial assets. In the cases of loans and investments in real estate-related assets for which
 the fair value option is elected, loan origination fees and costs related to the origination or acquisition of the instrument should be immediately recognized in earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on assets for which the fair value option
 has been elected are also reported in earnings without deferral. This is because under the fair value option, a lender reports the instrument at its exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell the instrument in an orderly
 transaction), which reflects the market s assessment of the instrument s cash flows and risks and does not include any entity-specific costs or fees.

As discussed in Note 2 Summary of
 Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected the fair value option for certain eligible financial assets including CRE loans and real estate-related investments.

The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis and must be applied to an entire
 instrument and is irrevocable once elected. Assets measured at fair value pursuant to this guidance are required to be reported separately on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets from those instruments using another accounting
 method.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment
 Disclosures. The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the disclosures within its Condensed Consolidated Financial
 Statements.

ITEM 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The primary components of our market risk are related to interest rates, credit risk, credit market values, liquidity and foreign currency exchange rates.
 While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience, and we seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital
 levels consistent with the risks we undertake .

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political
 considerations, and other factors beyond our control. Our net interest income is exposed to interest rate volatility primarily as a result of the floating rate nature of the investments we hold and the financing we place on them. Additionally,
 we may use company-level facilities featuring floating interest rates for liquidity and working capital purposes. Furthermore, we may make investments in fixed and floating rate debt securities; the value of our positions may increase or
 decrease depending on interest rate movements. Finally, interest rate changes may impact the demand for loans and the availability of financing needed to expand our investment portfolio .

A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher debt service payment requirements relative to any variable rate investments we
 hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. Rising interest rates carry default risk to our borrowers, because cash flows from underlying properties may fall below the debt service payments due to us on the
 investments, triggering borrower liquidity covenants. Therefore, we expect to protect property cash flows by requiring borrowers to purchase interest rate caps, which provides a hedge against rising interest rates, whereby the borrower will
 receive excess cash if interest rates exceed predetermined strike prices. Furthermore, rising interest rates also cause our overall cost of borrowing to increase, partially or fully, offsetting any increase in elevated debt service payments
 received on our variable rate investments. In general, we will seek to match the interest rate characteristics of our investments with the interest rate characteristics of any related financing obligations. In instances where the interest rate
 characteristics of an investment and the related financing obligation are not matched, we may mitigate such disparity through the utilization of interest rate derivatives of the same or more similar characteristics to the related financing
 obligation. An increase in interest rates may result in an increase in our net investment income and the amount of the performance fee payable to the Adviser .

A decline in interest rates can be expected to lead to lower debt service payments received from any variable rate investments we may hold, decreases in the interest income earned on any floating
 rate investments we hold, and increases in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. To mitigate the impact of reduced earnings as a result of declining interest rates, we expect to structure interest rate floors into each loan where the
 borrower will be required to pay minimum interest payments should interest rates fall below a predetermined rate. Additionally, reduced interest rates also cause our overall cost of borrowings to decrease. Because our borrowings do not typically
 feature interest rate floors, but our variable rate investments feature minimum interest payments due to us, declining interest rates may result in an increase to the Company s net interest income and an increase in the amount of the performance
 fee payable to the Adviser.

As of September 30, 2024, we had no market sensitive instruments.

Credit Spread Risk

Credit spread risk is the risk that interest rate spreads between two different financial instruments will change. In general, U.S. fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans and CMBS are priced based
 on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities or interest rate swaps. We will generally benefit if credit spreads narrow during the time that we hold a portfolio of mortgage loans, CMBS and/or CLO investments, and we may experience losses if credit
 spreads widen during the time that we hold a portfolio of mortgage loans, CMBS and/or CLO investments. We actively monitor our exposure to changes in credit spreads and we may enter into credit total return swaps or take positions in other
 credit-related derivative instruments to moderate our exposure to losses associated with a widening of credit spreads.

33 

Table of Contents 

Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk in our investments with respect to a borrower s ability to make required debt service payments to us and repay the unpaid principal balance in accordance to the
 terms of the loan agreement. We manage this risk by conducting a credit analysis prior to making an investment and by actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality, including subordination and diversification, of our
 investments on an ongoing basis. In addition, we re-evaluate the credit risk inherent in our investments on a regular basis taking into consideration a number of fundamental macro-economic factors such as gross domestic product, unemployment,
 interest rates, capital markets activity, retail sales, store closing/openings, corporate earnings, housing inventory, affordability and regional home price trends.

We are exposed to credit risk with respect to the tenants that occupy properties that serve as collateral to our investments. To mitigate this risk, we seek to avoid large single tenant exposure
 and we undertake a credit evaluation of major tenants prior to making a loan. This analysis includes extensive due diligence of a potential tenant s creditworthiness and business, as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the
 property to the tenant s core business operations.

Finally, we may be exposed to counterparty credit risk under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which
 creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We may seek to mitigate the credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering
 into transactions with high-quality counterparties.

Market Value Risks

We may also be exposed to market value risk with respect to the fair value of our investments, including debt securities and borrowings due to changes in market
 conditions, including credit spreads, interest rates, property cash flows, and commercial property values that serve as collateral. We seek to manage our exposure to market risk by originating or acquiring investments secured by different
 property types located in diverse, but liquid markets with stable credit ratings. The fair value of our investments may fluctuate, therefore the amount we will realize upon any repayment, sale, or an alternative liquidation event is unknown .

Commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: national, regional and local economic conditions; local real estate
 conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes and/or tax and legal considerations. Changes in commercial
 property values are difficult to predict with accuracy. We model a range of valuation scenarios and the resulting impacts to our investments.

Liquidity Risk

Market disruptions may lead to a significant decline in transaction activity in all or a significant portion of the asset classes in which we intend to invest and may at the same time lead to a
 significant contraction in short-term and long-term debt and equity funding sources. A decline in liquidity of real estate and real estate-related investments, as well as a lack of availability of observable transaction data and inputs, may make
 it more difficult to sell our investments or determine their fair values. As a result, we may be unable to sell investments, or only be able to sell investments at a price that may be materially different from the fair values presented. Also, in
 such conditions, there is no guarantee that the Company s borrowing arrangements or other arrangements for obtaining leverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us. In addition,
 a decline in market value of our assets may have particular adverse consequences in instances where we borrowed money based on the fair value of our assets. A decrease in the market value of our assets may result in the lender requiring us to
 post additional collateral or otherwise sell assets at a time when it may not be in our best interest to do so.

34 

Table of Contents 

Foreign Currency Risk

Our loans and investments that are denominated in a foreign currency will also be subject to risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates. We generally
 expect to mitigate this exposure by hedging the net currency exposure of our foreign currency assets to the currency of the borrowings that finance those assets. As a result, we expect to reduce our exposure to changes in portfolio value
 related to changes in foreign exchange rates. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amounts of payments received on the related
 investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailable hedges to offset changes in future exchange rate s.

 automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof convert into a number of Class I Common Shares (including any fractional shares) at the Class B Conversion Rate, Class R Conversion Rate, Class J-1 Conversion Rate, Class J-2
 Conversion Rate, Class J-3 Conversion Rate, Class J-4 Conversion Rate, Class J-5 Conversion Rate, Class S Conversion Rate, Class D Conversion Rate and Class E Conversion Rate, respectively, on the earliest of (i) a Listing of Class I Common
 Shares or (ii) a merger or consolidation of the Trust with or into another legal entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Trust s assets, except, in the case of clause (ii), any such transaction taken in
 connection with an internal restructuring transaction. 

13 

(b) At the end of any month in which
 (i) the Dealer Manager determines, in conjunction with the Trust s transfer agent for the Common Shares, and notifies the Trust in writing that the total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions and
 Ongoing Servicing Fees, with respect to the Shares held by a Shareholder within their account hit any agreed-upon amount under an arrangement made between the Dealer Manager and financial intermediaries or (ii) a broker-dealer is not eligible to
 receive any Ongoing Servicing Fees with respect to any Class R Common Shares, Class J-1 Common Shares, Class J-2 Common Shares, Class J-4 Common Shares, Class S Common Shares or Class D Common Shares and the Trust and the Dealer Manager, each in
 its sole discretion, have determined that any applicable Class R Common Shares, Class J-1 Common Shares, Class J-2 Common Shares, Class J-4 Common Shares, Class S Common Shares and Class D Common Shares shall be converted, each applicable Common
 Share shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof convert into a number of Class I Common Shares using the conversion rate equal to the fraction, the numerator of which is the NAV per share of the applicable class
 of shares and the denominator of which is the Class I NAV Per Share. 

(c) Upon the termination of
 employment or service for any reason or no reason of any employee, officer or director of Fortress or its Affiliates that holds or has an eligible family member that holds Class E Common Shares, the Adviser shall, in its discretion, have the
 ability to determine that all or a portion of the Class E Common Shares held by such employee, officer, director or eligible family member should be converted into shares of a different class. If the Adviser determines that any Class E Common
 Shares should be so converted, then upon notification by the Adviser to the Trust in writing, such Class E Common Shares shall be converted into a number of shares of a class determined by the Adviser using the conversion rate equal to the
 fraction, the numerator of which is the Class E NAV Per Share and the denominator of which is the NAV per share of the applicable class of shares. 

(d) With respect to any Shareholder
 whose Shares are converted into another class of Shares pursuant to this Declaration, the terms of such new class shall only apply to such Shareholder on a going-forward basis following such conversion and not on a retroactive basis for any time
 prior to such conversion; provided, that the Mandatory Holding Period, if applicable, in respect of any such converted Shares shall be calculated based on
 the day on which such Shareholder initially purchased the original Shares that were the subject of such conversion for cash (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, from the day on which any such Shares may have been (i) issued pursuant to any
 distribution reinvestment plan, (ii) received in connection with a conversion or exchange of other Shares or (iii) later acquired). 

Section 5.3.3 Rights Upon Liquidation . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or any Distribution of the assets of the Trust, the aggregate assets of the Trust available for
 Distribution to holders of the Common Shares shall be determined in accordance with applicable law. Immediately before any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or any distribution of the assets of the Trust pursuant to a plan of liquidation,
 dissolution or winding up, each Class B Common Share, Class R Common Share, Class J-1 Common Share, Class J-2 Common Share, Class J-3 Common Share, Class J-4 Common Share, Class J-5 Common Share, Class S Common Share, Class D Common Share and
 Class E Common Share will automatically convert to a number of Class I Common Shares (including any fractional shares) at the Class B Conversion Rate, Class R Conversion Rate, Class J-1 Conversion Rate, Class J-2 Conversion Rate, Class J-3
 Conversion Rate, Class J-4 Conversion Rate, Class J-5 Conversion Rate, Class S Conversion Rate, Class D Conversion Rate and Class E Conversion Rate, respectively. Following such conversion, the aggregate assets of the Trust available for
 Distribution to holders of the Common Shares, or the proceeds therefrom, shall be distributed to each holder of Class I Common Shares, ratably with each other holder of Class I Common Shares, in such proportion as the number of outstanding Class
 I Common Shares held by such Shareholder bears to the total number of Class I Common Shares then outstanding. 

14 

Section 5.4 Distributions . 

Section 5.4.1 The Board may from time to time authorize
 or cause the Trust to declare and pay to Shareholders such dividends or other Distributions in cash or other assets of the Trust or in securities of the Trust, including in Shares of one class payable to holders of Shares of another class, or
 from any other source as the Board in its sole discretion shall determine, and the amount of such dividends or other Distributions may vary between the classes or series of Shares. The Board shall endeavor to authorize the Trust to declare and
 pay such dividends and other Distributions as shall be necessary for the Trust to qualify as a REIT under the Code and to avoid the imposition of any U.S. federal or state income or excise taxes on the Trust; provided, however , Shareholders shall have no right to any dividend or other Distribution unless and until authorized by the Board and declared by the Trust. Before payment of any
 dividends or other Distributions, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Trust available for dividends or other Distributions such amounts as the Board may from time-to-time reserve for any Trust purpose, and the Board may modify or
 abolish any such reserve. Each dividend or other Distribution pursuant to this Section 5.4.1 to the Shareholders of a particular class or series of Shares shall be
 made ratably according to the number of Shares of such class or series held by each Shareholder on the applicable record date thereof, provided that no dividend or other Distribution need be made on Shares purchased pursuant to orders received,
 or for which payment is made, after such time or times as the Trustees may determine. Shareholders shall have no right to any dividend or other Distribution unless and until authorized by the Board and declared by the Trust, and then only at the
 time and in the amount and form authorized by the Board. Any action by the Board to cause the Trust to declare or pay any dividend or other Distribution shall be conclusive evidence of the authorization by the Board of such dividend or other
 Distribution. The exercise of the powers and rights of the Board pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be subject to the provisions of any class or series of Shares at
 the time outstanding. The receipt by any Person in whose name any Shares are registered on the records of the Trust or by his, her or its duly authorized agent shall be a sufficient discharge for all dividends or other Distributions payable or
 deliverable in respect of such Shares and from all liability to see to the application thereof. 

Other than Distributions pursuant to a program or programs by which the Trust voluntarily repurchases shares from its Shareholders or as otherwise
 set forth in this Declaration, each Shareholder of a class or series of Shares shall be treated the same with respect to Distributions as every other Shareholder of that class or series.

Distributions in respect of any Common Shares will generally be made on all classes of Common Shares at the same time. The per share amount of
 Distributions on each class of Common Shares will likely differ because of adjustment for class-specific items such as Ongoing Servicing Fees, management fees and performance fees (each as described in the Memorandum). The Trust expects to use the
 record share method of determining the per share amount of Distributions on each class of Common Shares, although the Board may choose any other method. The record share method is one of several distribution calculation methods for
 multiple-class funds recommended, but not required, by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Under this method, the amount to be distributed on Common Shares is increased by the sum of all class-specific Ongoing Servicing Fees,
 and as applicable, any class-specific management fees and/or class-specific performance fees, for such period. Such amount is divided by the number of Common Shares outstanding on the record date. Such per share amount is reduced for each class of
 Common Shares by the per share amount of any class-specific Ongoing Servicing Fees, and as applicable, any class-specific management fees and/or class-specific performance fees attributable to such class, if applicable.

15 

Section 5.4.2 At all times that the Trust is not
 publicly offered within the meaning of Section 562(c)(2) of the Code (as determined by the Board), all of the Common Shares shall be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of any gross Distribution in respect of any Common Shares, except that
 Ongoing Service Fees related solely to a particular class shall be borne by that class and shall be appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the Board) in the NAV, dividends, Distribution and liquidation rights of the Shares of that
 class. Following the time that, and for so long as, the Trust is publicly offered within the meaning of Section 562(c)(2) of the Code (as determined by the Board), Distributions shall be permitted in such other relative amounts as are
 permitted by this Declaration and authorized by the Board. The Distributions to the Shareholders, including any differences in Distributions between different classes or series, are intended to be made in a manner that does not cause any
 Distribution by the Trust to be a preferential dividend within the meaning of Section 562(c)(1) of the Code (and, in furtherance of the foregoing, it is intended that, for so long as the Trust is not publicly offered within the meaning of
 Section 562(c)(2) of the Code, all Distributions to the Common Shares shall be made pro rata in accordance with the number of Common Shares held except for differences due solely to shareholder services fees actually paid with respect to each
 class to the extent such differences would be permitted in accordance with the principles of Revenue Procedure 99-40), and this Declaration shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith. In the event that the Board determines that any
 amendment to this Declaration or other action to adjust the distribution rights set forth in this Declaration is required in order to ensure that Distributions made by the Trust are not preferential dividends (including, if applicable, with
 respect to any Preferred Shares authorized and issued after the date hereof), the Board may make such amendment or take such other action without Shareholder approval. 

Section 5.4.3 If the Board determines that consent
 dividends (within the meaning of Section 565 of the Code) with respect to a taxable year are necessary or appropriate to ensure or maintain the qualification of the Trust as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; to avoid the imposition of
 any U.S. federal income or excise tax; or for any other reason, the Board may require the holders of Common Shares and any other Persons to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate under the Code, any regulations promulgated thereunder,
 any court decision or any administrative interpretations of the U.S. Department of Treasury (including any U.S. Internal Revenue Service forms or other forms) to declare consent dividends sufficient to maintain REIT qualification and avoid U.S.
 federal income or excise tax or otherwise. 

16 

Section 5.4.4 Withholding . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Declaration, the Board may take any action that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to cause the Trust to comply with any withholding
 requirements established under any U.S. federal, state or local tax law, including withholding amounts from any distribution to be made to any Shareholder. Any amounts required to be withheld under any such law by reason of the status of, or any
 action or failure to act (other than an action or failure to act pursuant to this Declaration) by, any Shareholder shall be withheld from distributions otherwise to be made to such Shareholder, and, to the extent such amounts exceed such
 distributions, such Shareholder shall pay the amount of such excess to the Trust in the manner and at the time or times required by the Board. For purposes of this Declaration, any amount withheld from a distribution to a Shareholder and paid to
 a governmental body shall be treated as if distributed to such Shareholder. 

Section 5.5 Voting Rights . Except as may otherwise be specified in the terms of any class or series of Shares or as provided herein, each Share shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter upon which
 holders of Shares are entitled to vote. Except to the extent that the Trust directly or indirectly owns Shares in a fiduciary capacity, neither the Trust nor any entity of which the Trust is entitled to exercise a majority of the outstanding
 voting power may vote on any matter, and Shares held by the Trust or any such entity shall not be counted in determining the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter or at any time. Subject to the terms of any class or series of
 Shares then outstanding limiting or expanding the voting rights of such Shares, Shareholders shall be entitled to vote only on the following matters: 

(a) the removal of a Trustee for Cause and the election of a successor Trustee as provided in ARTICLE VII ; provided , that if the Trustee so removed was designated by Fortress pursuant to Section 7.2.1 , then Fortress shall have the exclusive right to designate a successor Trustee for election to the Board;

(b) in the event that there are no Trustees, the election of Trustees;

(c) the amendment of this Declaration, to the extent provided in Section

11.3 ;

(d) the merger, consolidation or conversion of the Trust or the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, to the extent
 provided in Section 12.1 ; and

(e) such other matters that the Board has submitted to the Shareholders for approval or ratification.

Except with respect to the foregoing matters, no action taken by the Shareholders shall in any way bind the Trust or the Board. Unless a different proportion is
 specified in the Certificate of Trust, this Declaration or the Bylaws (and notwithstanding any different proportion of votes that may be specified in the MSTA to approve any matter), the affirmative vote of a plurality of the total votes cast in
 the election of a Trustee shall be sufficient to elect any Trustee, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of Shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter
 that may properly come before the Shareholders at such meeting. There shall be no requirement to hold an annual meeting of the Shareholders in any year.

17 

Section 5.6 Classified or Reclassified Shares . Prior to the issuance of classified or reclassified Shares of any class or series the Board shall, without any action by the Shareholders, amend or supplement this
 Declaration, including any exhibit or schedule thereto, to: (a) designate that class or series to distinguish it from all other classes and series of Shares; (b) specify the number (or an unlimited number) of Shares to be included in the class
 or series; and (c) set or change, subject to the provisions of ARTICLE VI and subject to the express terms of any class or series of Shares outstanding at the time, the
 preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other Distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption for each such class or series. Any of the terms of any class or
 series of Shares set or changed pursuant to this Section 5.6 may be made dependent upon facts or events ascertainable outside this Declaration (including determinations
 by the Board or other facts or events within the control of the Trust) and may vary among holders thereof, provided that the manner in which such facts, events or variations shall operate upon the terms of such class or series of Shares is
 clearly and expressly set forth in an amendment to this Declaration. 

Section 5.7 Certificate of Trust, Declaration and Bylaws . The rights of all Shareholders and the terms of all Shares are subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Trust, this Declaration and the Bylaws. 

Section 5.8 Divisions and Combinations of Shares . Subject to an express provision to the contrary in the terms of any class or series of Shares hereafter authorized, the Board shall have the power to divide or combine the
 outstanding Shares of any class or series of Shares, without a vote of Shareholders. The Board may amend this Declaration, without any action by the Shareholders, to effect any such division or combination of outstanding Shares. 

Section 5.9 No Issuance of Share Certificates . Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the Trust shall not issue share certificates. A Shareholder s investment shall be recorded on the books of the Trust. To Transfer
 his, her or its Shares, a Shareholder shall submit an executed form to the Trust, which form shall be provided by the Trust upon request. Such Transfer will also be recorded on the books of the Trust. Upon issuance or Transfer of Shares, the
 Trust will provide the Shareholder with information concerning his, her or its rights with regard to such Shares, as required by the Bylaws and the MSTA or other applicable law. The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer
 or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to who are the Shareholders of each class and series and as to the number of Shares of each class and series held from time to time by each Shareholder. 

Section 5.10 Preemptive Rights and Appraisal Rights; Derivative Claims . Except as may be provided by the Board in setting the terms of classified or reclassified Common Shares or Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 5.6 or as may otherwise be provided by contract approved by the Board, no Shareholder shall, as such holder, have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for
 any additional Shares or any other security that the Trust may issue or sell. Shareholders shall not be entitled to exercise any appraisal or dissenter s rights or any rights analogous to those of an objecting stockholder provided for under
 Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL, unless the Board, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified by the Board, shall determine that such rights apply, with respect to all or any classes or series of Shares, to one or more transactions
 occurring after the date of such determination in connection with which holders of such Shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise such rights. A Shareholder shall not be entitled to recover a judgement in favor of the Trust, assert a claim
 in the name of the Trust, or bring any action that is derivative in nature without the approval of the Board. 

Section 5.11 Repurchase of Shares . The Board may establish, from time to time, a program or programs by which the Trust voluntarily repurchases Shares from its Shareholders. 

18 

Section 5.12 Distribution Reinvestment Plans . The Board may establish, from time to time, a Distribution reinvestment plan or plans. 

Section 5.13 Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability . Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving only the rights provided in this Declaration and the Bylaws. Every Shareholder by virtue of having
 become a Shareholder shall be held to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms of this Declaration and the Bylaws and to have become a party hereto and thereto. The death of a Shareholder during the continuance of the Trust shall not
 operate to terminate the Trust nor entitle the representative of any deceased Shareholder to an accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere against the Trust or the Trustees, but only to the rights of said decedent under this Trust. 
 Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust Property or right to call for a partition or division of the same or for an accounting, nor shall the ownership of Shares afford
 Shareholders the status of partners of the Trust. For the avoidance of doubt, Shareholders shall have no rights, privileges, claims or remedies under any contract or agreement entered into by the Trust with any service provider or other agent to
 or contractor with the Trust, including any third-party beneficiary rights, except as may be expressly provided in any such contract or agreement. Neither the Trust nor any Trustee, nor any officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall have any
 power to bind personally any Shareholder, nor except as specifically provided herein or in the Bylaws to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any sum of money or assessment whatsoever other than such as the Shareholder may at any time
 personally agree to pay. Each Share, whether or not evidenced by a certificate, shall constitute a security within the meaning of, and governed by, (i) Article 8 of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code (including Section 8-102(a)(l5) thereof)
 as in effect and as it may be amended or superseded from time to time, and (ii) Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any other applicable jurisdiction that now or hereafter substantially includes the 1994 revisions to Article 8 thereof as
 adopted by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and approved by the American Bar Association on February 14, 1995 or any successor uniform act or law in effect in the State of Maryland from
 time to time. 

Section 5.14 Small Accounts . The Board may establish, from time to time, one or more minimum account sizes for Shareholder accounts, which may differ within and among any classes or series of Shares, and may impose account
 fees on (which may be satisfied by involuntarily redeeming the requisite number of Shares in any such account in the amount of such fee), or require the involuntary redemption of Shares held in, those accounts the NAV of which for any reason
 falls below such established minimum account sizes, or may authorize the Trust to convert any such Shares in such account to Shares of another class or series, or take any other such action with respect to minimum account sizes as may be deemed
 necessary or appropriate by the Board, in each case upon such terms as shall be established by the Board. 

Section 5.15 FCR Management Agreement . Notwithstanding anything in the FCR Management Agreement or this Declaration to the contrary, for so long as the FCR Management Agreement is in effect, (a) an Adviser Change of
 Control, (b) any amendment to Section 9 of the FCR Management Agreement that adversely impacts the contract rights of outstanding Class B Common Shares with respect to the payment of management fees or performance fees, and (c) any amendment to
 Section 10(f) of the FCR Management Agreement, shall, in each case, require the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B Common Shares, voting separately as a class . 

19 

ARTICLE VI

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES 

Section 6.1 Ownership of Shares . 

Section 6.1.1 Ownership Limitations . 

(a) Basic Restrictions . 

(i) During the period commencing on
 the Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date, no Person, other than an Excepted Holder, shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit. 

(ii) During the period commencing on
 the Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date, no Excepted Holder shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit (if any) applicable to such Excepted Holder. 

(iii) During the period commencing on
 the date hereof and prior to the Restriction Termination Date, no Person shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares to the extent that such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares would result in the Trust failing to
 qualify for taxation as a REIT, including such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership that would result in the Trust (x) being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership
 interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or (y) owning (actually or Constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Trust (or its subsidiaries) from such
 tenant would cause the Trust (or its subsidiaries) to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code. 

(iv) Subject to Section 6.4 , during the period commencing on the Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date, notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, any
 Transfer of Shares (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of a National Securities Exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) that, if effective, would result in Shares being
 Beneficially Owned by fewer than 100 Persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. 

(v) The number and value of the
 outstanding Shares (or any class or series thereof) held or owned by any Person (including within the meaning of (A) Section 542(a)(2) of the Code as modified by Section 856(h) of the Code, or (B) Section 856(d) of the Code) shall be determined
 by the Board, which determination shall be conclusive for all purposes. 

20 

(b) Transfer in Trust or Voided Transfer . If any Transfer of Shares occurs (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of a National Securities
 Exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) which, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning Shares in violation of Section
 6.1.1(a)(i) , Section 6.1.1(a)(ii) or Section 6.1.1(a)(iii) , as applicable
 (any such violation, an Ownership Violation ), then: (i) that number of Shares, the Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership (as applicable) of which otherwise
 would cause an Ownership Violation by such Person (rounded upward to the nearest whole share, and such excess shares, as so rounded, the Excess Shares ), shall be
 automatically transferred to a Charitable Trust or Charitable Trusts for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 6.3 , effective as of the close
 of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such Person shall acquire no rights in the Excess Shares; or (ii) if the transfer to the Charitable Trust or Charitable Trusts described in Section 6.1.1(b)(i) would not be effective for any reason to prevent an Ownership Violation, then the Transfer of that number of Shares that otherwise would cause an Ownership Violation by any
 Person (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be void ab initio, in which case the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in the Excess Shares. 

To the extent that, upon a transfer of Shares pursuant to this Section 6.1.1(b) ,
 a violation of any provision of this ARTICLE VI would nonetheless be continuing (for example where the ownership of Shares by a single Charitable Trust would violate the
 100 shareholder requirement applicable to REITs), then Shares shall be transferred to that number of Charitable Trusts, each having a distinct Charitable Trustee and a Charitable Beneficiary or Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each
 other Charitable Trust, such that there is no violation of any provision of this ARTICLE VI .

In determining which Shares are to be transferred to a Charitable Trust in accordance with this Section 6.1.1 and Section 6.2 , Shares shall be so transferred to a Charitable Trust in such manner that minimizes the aggregate value of the
 Shares that are transferred to the Charitable Trust (except to the extent that the Board determines that the Shares transferred to the Charitable Trust shall be those directly or indirectly held or Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned by a
 Person or Persons that caused or contributed to the application of this Section 6.1.1 , and to the extent not inconsistent therewith, on a pro rata basis).

(c) Cooperation . The Shareholder that would otherwise constitute a Prohibited Owner absent the application of the provisions of Section

6.1.1(b) shall use best efforts and take all actions necessary or requested by the Trust to cooperate with effecting the actions taken by the Board pursuant to Section

6.1.1(b) , including informing the Trust where and by whom any Excess Shares may be held and instructing its agents to cooperate in the prompt implementation and effectuation of the actions so taken by the Board. 

21 

Section 6.1.2 Remedies for Breach . If the Board shall at any time determine that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section

6.1.1 or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any Shares that would result in a violation of Section

6.1.1 (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board may take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including causing the Trust to redeem Shares, refusing
 to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Trust or the Trust s transfer agent or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event; provided,

however , that any Transfer or attempted Transfer in violation of Section 6.1.1(a) (or other event that results in a violation of Section 6.1.1(a) shall automatically result in the transfer to a Charitable Trust as described above, or, if applicable, shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or
 non-action) by the Board. Such Person shall be liable, for all costs incurred in connection therewith, including the costs and expenses of the Charitable Trustee. This Section
 6.1.2 shall not in any way limit the provisions of Section 6.1.1(b) . 

Section 6.1.3 Notice of Restricted Transfer . Any Person that acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares that will or may violate Section 6.1.1(a) , or any Person that would have owned Excess Shares, shall immediately give written notice to the Trust of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction,
 shall give at least 15 days prior written notice to the Trust and provide to the Trust such other information as the Trust may request. 

Section 6.1.4 Owners Required to Provide Information . Every Person that is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of 5 or more (or such lower percentage as required by the Code) of any series or any class of outstanding
 Shares at the time of determination, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year and also within three Business Days after a request from the Trust, shall give written notice to the Trust stating the name and address of such owner, the
 number of Shares Beneficially Owned and (if requested by the Trust) Constructively Owned by it, and a description of the manner in which such Shares are held; provided 
 that a Shareholder that holds Shares as nominee for another Person, which other Person is required to include in gross income the Distributions received on such Shares (an Actual
 Owner ), shall give written notice to the Trust stating the name and address of such Actual Owner and the number of Shares of such Actual Owner with respect to which the Shareholder is the nominee. Each Person that is a Beneficial
 Owner or Constructive Owner of Shares and each Person (including the Shareholder) that is holding Shares for a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner shall provide in writing to the Trust such information as the Trust may request in order to
 determine the Trust s qualification for taxation as a REIT and the Trust s compliance with other applicable laws or requirements of any governmental authority and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or other governmental
 authority or to determine such compliance. 

Section 6.1.5 Ambiguity . In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this ARTICLE VI (or any definition relevant
 thereto), the Board shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this ARTICLE VI with respect to any situation based on the facts known to
 it. In the event this ARTICLE VI requires an action by the Board and this Declaration fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board shall
 have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 . Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board (which the Board makes in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 6.1.2 acquired Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares in violation of Section
 6.1.1 , such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the Shares which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who
 actually own such Shares based upon the relative number of Shares held by each such Person. 

22 

Section 6.1.6 Exceptions . 

(a) Subject to Section 6.1.1(a)(iii) , the Board, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) any Person from any of the ownership limitations set forth in Section 6.1.1(a) and establish, increase, or decrease an Excepted Holder Limit for such Person if: (A) such Person provides to the Board, for the benefit of the Trust, such
 representations and undertakings, if any, as the Board may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable in order for it to make the determination that the Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares by such Person
 in excess of the Ownership Limit will not now or in the future jeopardize the Trust s ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code and (B) such Person agrees that any violation of such representations and undertakings or any attempted
 violation thereof will give rise to the application of the remedies set forth in Section 6.1.1(b) and Section

6.1.2 with respect to Shares held in excess of the Ownership Limit or the Excepted Holder Limit (as may be applicable) with respect to such Person. 

(b) Prior to granting any exception
 pursuant to Section 6.1.6(a) , the Board may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance
 satisfactory to the Board in its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Trust s qualification for taxation as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board may impose
 such conditions or restrictions as it deems necessary, appropriate or desirable in connection with granting such exemption or waiver or creating any Excepted Holder Limit. 

(c) An underwriter or initial
 purchaser that participates in a public offering, a private placement or a forward sale or distribution of Shares (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares (or securities
 convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) in excess of the Ownership Limit or the limitations in Section 6.1.1(a)(i) or (ii) , but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public offering, private placement or forward sale or distribution as determined by the Board. 

(d) The Board may only reduce the
 Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder: (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any time, or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection
 with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No Excepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit.

 Shares permitted to be Beneficially Owned under such new Ownership Limit, taking into account clause (i) of this proviso permitting ownership in excess of the decreased Ownership Limit (or portion thereof) in certain cases. 

Section 6.2 Transfer of Shares . 

Section 6.2.1 Ownership in Charitable Trust . Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 6.1.1(b) that results in a transfer
 of Shares to a Charitable Trust, such Shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee as trustee or trustees, as applicable, of a Charitable Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries (except
 to the extent otherwise provided in Section 6.2.5 ). Such transfer to the Charitable Trustee shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Business

 upon demand and any dividend or other Distribution authorized but unpaid with respect to such Shares shall be paid when due to the Charitable Trustee. Any dividends or other Distributions so paid to the Charitable Trustee shall be held in trust
 for the Charitable Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee and, effective as of the date that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, the
 Charitable Trustee shall have the authority (at the Charitable Trustee s discretion) (a) to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner with respect to such Shares at any time such Shares constituted Excess Shares with respect to such
 Prohibited Owner and (b) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Charitable Trustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; provided,

however , that if the Trust has already taken irreversible action, as determined by the Board, then the Charitable Trustee shall not have the power to rescind and recast such vote.

Section 6.2.4 Rights upon Liquidation . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets of the Trust, the Charitable Trustee shall be entitled to receive, ratably
 with each other holder of Shares of the class or series of Shares that is held in trust by the Charitable Trustee, that portion of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to the holders of such class or series (determined based upon
 the ratio that the number of shares of such class or series of Shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee bears to the total number of shares of such class or series of Shares then outstanding). The Charitable Trustee shall distribute any
 such assets received in respect of the Shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee in any liquidation, dissolution or winding up or distribution of the assets of the Trust, in accordance with Section 6.2.5 . 

Section 6.2.5 Sale of Shares by Charitable Trustee . Unless otherwise directed by the Board, as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving notice from the Trust that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trust

6.1.1(b) to a Person, designated by the Charitable Trustee, whose ownership of the Shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section 6.1.1(a) . 

Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate. Upon any such sale, the Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as
 provided in this Section 6.2.5 . A Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (a) the price paid by the Prohibited Owner for the Shares or, if the Prohibited Owner
 did not give value for the Shares in connection with the event causing the Shares to become Excess Shares (for example, in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the Market Price of the Shares on the day of the event causing the
 Shares to become Excess Shares and (b) the proceeds received by the Charitable Trustee (net of any expenses of the Charitable Trustee and the Trust) from the sale or other disposition of the Shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee. The
 Charitable Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends or other Distributions which have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Charitable Trustee pursuant to Section 6.2.3 . Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be paid to the Charitable Beneficiary, less the costs and expenses of
 the Charitable Trustee and the Trust. If, prior to the discovery by the Trust that Shares have been transferred to the Charitable Trustee, such Shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (a) such Shares shall be deemed to have been sold on
 behalf of the Charitable Trust and (b) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such Shares that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 6.2.5 , such excess shall be paid promptly to the Charitable Trustee upon demand. 

25

 Excess Shares shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Trust, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (a) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such Shares becoming Excess Shares (or, if the
 Prohibited Owner did not give value for such Shares, such as in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction, the Market Price per Share on the day of the event causing the Shares to become Excess Shares) and (b) the Market Price per
 share on the date the Trust, or its designee, accepts such offer. The Trust may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and Distributions which have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the
 Prohibited Owner to the Charitable Trustee pursuant to Section 6.2.3 . The Trust may pay the amount of such reduction to the Charitable Trustee for the benefit of the
 Charitable Beneficiary. The Trust shall have the right to accept such offer until the Charitable Trustee, if any, has sold the Shares held in trust by the Charitable Trustee, if any, pursuant to Section 6.2.5 . Upon such a sale to the Trust, if a Charitable Trust has been established pursuant to this ARTICLE VI , the interest of the
 Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate. The Charitable Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale in accordance with Section 6.2.5 . 

Section 6.2.7 Designation of Charitable Beneficiaries . By written notice to the Charitable Trustee, the Trust shall designate from time to time one or more Charitable Beneficiaries of the Charitable Trust such that Shares
 held in trust by the Charitable Trustee would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 6.1.1(a) in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary. The Charitable
 Beneficiary shall not obtain any enforceable right to the Charitable Trust or any of its trust corpus until so designated and thereafter any such rights remain subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE VI , including Section 6.3 . Neither the failure of the Trust to make such designation nor the failure of the Trust to appoint the
 Charitable Trustee before the automatic transfer provided for in Section 6.1.1(b) shall make such transfer ineffective, provided that the Trust thereafter makes such
 designation and appointment. The Trust may, in its sole discretion, designate a substitute or additional nonprofit organization as the Charitable Beneficiary at any time and for any or no reason. Any determination by the Trust with respect to
 the application of this ARTICLE VI shall be binding on each Charitable Beneficiary. 

Section 6.3 Retroactive Changes . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ARTICLE VI , the Board is authorized and empowered to
 retroactively amend, alter or repeal any rights which the Charitable Trust, the Charitable Trustee or the Charitable Beneficiary may have under this ARTICLE VI ,
 including, granting retroactive Excepted Holder status to any otherwise Prohibited Owner, with the effect of any transfer of Excess Shares to a Charitable Trust being fully and retroactively revoked; provided, however , that the Board shall not have the authority or power to retroactively amend, alter or repeal any obligations to pay amounts incurred prior to such time and owed or payable to the
 Charitable Trustee. 

26 

Section 6.4 Transactions on a National Securities Exchange . Nothing in this ARTICLE VI shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered
 into through the facilities of a National Securities Exchange or any automated inter-dealer quotation system.

Section 6.5 Authority and Enforcement . The Board shall have all power and authority necessary or advisable to implement the provisions of this ARTICLE VI . 

The Trust is authorized specifically to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this ARTICLE VI .

 preserving the Trust s qualification for taxation as a REIT. 

Section 6.6 Non-Waiver . No delay or failure on the part of the Trust or the Board in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Trust or the Board, as the case may be, except
 to the extent specifically waived in writing. 

Section 6.7 Enforceability . If any of the restrictions on Transfer of Shares contained in this ARTICLE VI are determined to be
 void, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Prohibited Owner may be deemed, at the option of the Trust, to have acted as an agent of the Trust in acquiring such Shares
 and to hold such Shares on behalf of the Trust. 

Section 6.8 Continued Effect . The provisions of this ARTICLE VI shall continue in full force and effect indefinitely, regardless of whether or
 not the Trust qualifies as a REIT. 

Section 6.9 Legend . Each certificate for Shares, if any, shall bear a legend describing the restrictions on transferability of Shares contained herein or, instead of a legend, the certificate may state that the Trust will

 determination of the Board, one or more of the Trustees or a nominee acting for and on behalf of the Trust, shall be deemed to hold legal title and beneficial ownership of any income earned on securities of the Trust issued by any business

 for purposes of the Investment Advisers Act . Such consent of the Board may be provided by the vote of a majority
 of Trustees (including a majority of Independent Trustees) . Each Shareholder agrees that, with respect to any Board consent sought by Fortress or its Affiliates relating to any Adviser Agreement, or the arrangements contemplated
 thereby, such consent shall be binding upon the Trust and each Shareholder. Each Shareholder further agrees that any such consent alternatively may be granted by consent of the Board and,
 subject to Section 5.15 , Shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

 case, the Adviser and its Affiliates shall not be in breach of any such duty or this Declaration and shall not have any liability to the Trust or the Shareholders for such actions taken in good faith by them.

 the Adviser, Fortress or its Affiliates may request such approval or consent and require a response within a specified reasonable time period (which shall not be less than 45 days), and failure by a Shareholder to respond within such time period
 shall be deemed to constitute such Shareholder s approval or consent.

 authorized by the Board or incurred to establish such Covered Person s right to indemnification hereunder, or (y) in connection with any claim with respect to which such Covered Person is found to be liable to the Trust. 

The Trust may, with the approval of the Board, provide or obligate itself to provide such indemnification or payment or reimbursement of expenses to
 any Person that served a predecessor of the Trust as a Covered Person or any employee or agent of the Trust or any predecessor of the Trust. Except that no preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification shall be required
 for the payment or reimbursement of expenses, any indemnification or payment or reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Declaration shall be furnished in accordance with the procedures provided for indemnification or advance or
 reimbursement of expenses, as the case may be, under Section 2-418 of the MGCL for directors of Maryland corporations.

Neither the amendment nor repeal of this ARTICLE X , nor the adoption
 or amendment of any other provision of this Declaration inconsistent with this Article, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding paragraph with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such
 amendment, repeal or adoption. The rights to indemnification and advance of expenses provided by this Declaration shall vest immediately upon a Person becoming a Covered Person.

Section 10.3.2 Indemnification Not Exclusive . The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any such Covered Person may be entitled. As used in this ARTICLE X , the term Covered Person shall include such person s heirs, executors and
 administrators. Nothing contained in this ARTICLE X shall affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel of the Trust, other than Trustees and officers, and
 other Persons may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of the Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of such Person; provided, however , that the Trust shall not purchase or maintain any such liability insurance in contravention of applicable law. 

34 

Section 10.4 General Corporation Law . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the establishment of Trustees limitation of liability as set forth in Section

10.2.2 and the providing of indemnity or contracting with related parties described in this ARTICLE X in accordance with terms and procedures not
 materially less favorable to the Trust than the maximum discretion and maximum indemnification permitted by the MGCL (as in effect at the time such provision was adopted or such contract or transaction was entered into or as it may thereafter be
 in effect) shall be deemed to have satisfied the criteria set forth in this ARTICLE X ; but nothing herein is intended to require that the terms and procedures
 established by the MGCL shall be required to limit liability, to provide indemnification or for contracting as set forth in this ARTICLE X . 

Section 10.5 Right of Trustees, Officers, Employees and Agents to Own Shares or Other Property and to Engage in Other Business . Subject to any restrictions which may be adopted by the Trustees in the Bylaws or otherwise,
 the Adviser and each of its Affiliates and each Trustee and officer of the Trust may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust, for their individual account, and may exercise all rights of a Shareholder to the same extent and in the
 same manner as if they were not the Adviser or its Affiliate or a Trustee or officer of the Trust. The Adviser and each of its Affiliates and each Trustee and officer of the Trust may, in their personal capacity or in the capacity of trustee,
 officer, director, equityholder, partner, member, advisor or employee of any Person or otherwise, have business interests and engage in business activities similar to or in addition to those relating to the Trust, which interests and activities
 may be similar to and competitive with (or complimentary to) those of the Trust and may include the investing in securities of real estate or other companies or in other interests in Persons engaged in real estate or other businesses. The
 Adviser and each of its Affiliates and each Trustee and officer of the Trust shall be free of any obligation to present to the Trust any business opportunity which comes to them, even if such opportunity is of a character which, if presented to
 the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and the Trust hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in any such opportunity. The Adviser and each of its Affiliates and each Trustee and officer of the Trust may be interested as a trustee, officer,
 director, equityholder, partner, member, advisor or employee of, or otherwise have a direct or indirect interest in: (a) any Person who may be engaged to render advice or services to the Trust, (b) any Person in which the Trust has invested or
 may invest, (c) any Person from which the Trust has purchased or may purchase securities or other property and (d) any Person to which the Trust has sold or may sell securities or other property; and the Adviser and each of its Affiliates and
 each Trustee and officer of the Trust may receive compensation from such other Person as well as compensation from the Trust. None of these activities shall be deemed to conflict with any applicable duties or powers as the Adviser or its
 Affiliate or as a Trustee or officer of the Trust. 

Section 10.6 Trustees, Shareholders, etc. Not Personally Liable . All Persons extending credit to, contracting with or having any claim against the Trust or a particular series or class of Shares shall look only to the
 assets of the Trust or the assets of that particular series or class of Shares for payment under such credit, contract or claim; and neither the Shareholders nor the Trustees, nor any of the Trust s officers, employees or agents, whether past,
 present or future, shall be personally liable therefor.

 officer shall not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law. The Trustees or officers may take advice of counsel or other experts with respect to the meaning and operation of this Declaration, and shall be under no liability
 for any act or omission in accordance with such advice or for failing to follow such advice. The Trustees and officers shall not be required to give any bond as such, nor any surety if a bond is required. 

Section 10.8 Liability of Third Persons Dealing with Trustees . No Person dealing with the Trustees shall be bound to make any inquiry concerning the validity of any transaction made or to be made by the Trustees or to see
 to the application of any payments made or property transferred to the Trust or upon its order.

 including for the purchase or sale of property or for any type of services, including those in connection with the offer or sale of securities of the Trust, with any Person, including any Covered Person or employee or agent of the Trust or any Person Affiliated with a Covered Person or employee or agent of the Trust, whether or not any of them has a financial interest in such transaction. The procedures and presumptions set forth in Section
 2-419 of the MGCL shall be available for and apply to any contract or other transaction between the Trust and any of its Trustees or between the Trust and any other trust, corporation, firm or other legal entity in which any of its Trustees is a
 trustee or director, or has a material financial interest.

XI . The merger or consolidation of the Trust with another Person, the conversion of the Trust, the dissolution of the Trust or any other transaction between the Trust and another Person in which the Trust does not survive as a

 EXHIBIT 4.1

Exhibit 4.1 

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

Fortress Credit Realty Income Trust, a Maryland statutory trust (the Company ), hereby adopts the following plan (the Plan with respect to cash distributions declared by its board of trustees on the Company s common shares, par value 0.01 per share (the Common Shares ), which are classified as Class B common shares Class B Common Shares ), Class R common shares Class R Common Shares ), Class J-1 common shares Class J-1 Common Shares ), Class
 J-2 common shares Class J-2 Common Shares ), Class J-3 common shares Class J-3 Common Shares ), Class J-4 common shares Class J-4
 Common Shares ), Class J-5 common shares Class J-5 Common Shares ), Class S common shares Class S Common Shares ), Class D common shares Class D Common Shares ), Class I common shares Class I Common Shares ), and Class E common shares Class E Common Shares ).

1. Unless a shareholder specifically opts out of participating in the Plan (or, in the case of clients of participating broker-dealers that do not permit automatic enrollment in the Plan,
 opts to participate in the Plan), all cash distributions hereafter declared by the Company s board of trustees shall be reinvested by the Company, in the same class of Common Shares with respect to which the distribution was received, on behalf of
 each shareholder, and no action shall be required on such shareholder s part to receive such Common Shares. The Plan will be administered by SS C Technologies, Inc. (the Plan Administrator ).

2. Subject to the board of trustees discretion and applicable legal restrictions, the Company intends to authorize and declare distributions on a monthly basis or on such other date or dates
 as may be fixed from time to time by the board of trustees to shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date(s) established by the board of trustees for the cash distribution involved. The Company intends to pay distributions on a
 monthly basis.

3. The Company shall use newly-issued shares of its Common Shares, in the same class of the Common Shares with respect to which the distribution was received, to implement the Plan. The
 number of newly-issued shares to be issued to a shareholder shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such shareholder by a price equal to the transaction price, which will generally be the prior month s
 net asset value NAV per share for such class. Common Shares issued pursuant to the Plan will have the same voting rights as shares of Common Shares issued pursuant to the Company s private offering. There
 will be no selling commissions or other sales charges on Common Shares issued to a shareholder under the Plan; provided, however , that Class R Common Shares, Class J-1
 Common Shares, Class J-2 Common Shares, Class J-4 Common Shares, Class S Common Shares and Class D Common Shares will be subject to ongoing servicing fees as set forth in the Company s private placement memorandum, as amended and/or supplemented from
 time to time (the PPM ). The Company shall pay the Plan Administrator s fees under the Plan.

4. For each participant, the Plan Administrator will maintain a record which shall reflect for each calendar month the distributions received by the Plan Administrator on behalf of such
 participant. The Plan Administrator will use the aggregate amount of distributions to all participants for each calendar month or quarter to purchase shares for the participants. Distributions shall be invested by the Plan Administrator in shares, to
 the extent available, promptly following the payment date with respect to such distributions. The purchased shares will be allocated among the participants based on the portion of the aggregate distributions received by the Plan Administrator on
 behalf of each participant, as reflected in the records maintained by the Plan Administrator. The ownership of the shares purchased pursuant to the Plan shall be reflected on the books of the Company or its transfer agent. No certificates will be
 issued to a participant for shares purchased on behalf of the participant pursuant to the Plan.

5. The Plan Administrator will confirm to each participant each acquisition made pursuant to the Plan on a quarterly basis. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each
 participant s account. In the event of termination of a participant s account under the Plan, the Plan Administrator will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the monthly transaction price of the Company s shares available at
 the time of termination. For purposes of the Plan, Business Day means any day except Saturday, Sunday, or any day commercial banks are closed in New York pursuant to federal or state law.

6. Each participant is requested to promptly notify the Company in writing if the participant experiences a material change in his or her financial condition, including the failure to meet
 the income and net worth standards set forth in the Company s PPM.

7. The Plan may be terminated by the Company upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 10 business days prior to the effectiveness of such termination.

8. A participant may terminate participation in the Plan at any time, without penalty, by delivering written notice (which may be electronic) to the Plan Administrator. Such notice must be
 received by the Plan Administrator 10 Business Days in advance of the first calendar day of the next month in order for a participant s termination to be effective for such month. Any distributions to be paid to such shareholder on or after such date
 will be paid in cash on the scheduled distribution payment date. If a participant terminates Plan participation, the Company may, at its option, ensure that the terminating participant s account will reflect the whole number of shares in such
 participant s account and provide a check for the cash value of any fractional share in such account. Upon termination of Plan participation for any reason, future Distributions will be distributed to the shareholder in cash.

9. These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Company at any time; provided that notice of any material amendment is sent to
 participants at least 10 Business Days prior to the effective date of that amendment. Any amendment or supplement may include an appointment by the Plan Administrator in its place and stead of a successor agent under the terms and conditions agreed
 upon by the Company, with full power and authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Administrator as agreed to by the Company.

10. The Plan Administrator will at all times act in good faith and use its best efforts within reasonable limits to ensure its full and timely performance of all services to be performed by it
 under this Plan and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors.

11. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof, to the extent such principles would require or
 permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

Share Repurchase Plan

Shareholders may request that the Company repurchase its common shares through their financial advisor or directly with the Company s transfer agent. The procedures relating to the repurchase of the Company s common
 shares are as follows:

Certain broker-dealers require that their clients process repurchases through their broker-dealer, which may impact the time necessary to process such repurchase request, impose more restrictive deadlines than described under this Plan,
 impact the timing of a Shareholder receiving repurchase proceeds and require different paperwork or process than described in this Plan. Shareholders should contact their broker-dealer first if they want to request the repurchase of their
 shares.

Under this Plan, to the extent the Company chooses to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, the Company will only repurchase shares as of the opening of the last business day of that quarter (a Repurchase Date ).
 Shareholders will not receive any distributions for such shares for the month in which their shares are repurchased. To have shares repurchased, a Shareholder s repurchase request and required documentation must be received in good order by
 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the second to last business day of the applicable quarter. Settlements of share repurchases will generally be made within three business days of the Repurchase Date. Repurchase requests received and processed by
 the Company s transfer agent will be effected at a repurchase price equal to the Transaction Price on the applicable Repurchase Date (which will generally be equal to the Company s prior month s NAV per share), subject to any Early Repurchase
 Deduction (in the case of any Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares) (as defined below).

A Shareholder may withdraw his or her repurchase request by completing a repurchase withdrawal form and sending the form to the transfer agent, directly or through the Shareholder s financial intermediary, or by emailing FCR@fortress.com.
 Repurchase requests must be canceled before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the second to last business day of the applicable quarter. 

If a repurchase request is received after 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the second to last business day of the applicable quarter, the repurchase request will be executed, if at all, on the next quarter s Repurchase Date at the Transaction
 Price applicable to that quarter (subject to any Early Repurchase Deduction in the case of any Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares), unless such request is withdrawn prior to
 the repurchase. Repurchase requests received and processed by the Company s transfer agent on a business day, but after the close of business on that day or on a day that is not a business day, will be deemed received on the next business
 day. All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of repurchase requests and notices of withdrawal will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be final and binding.

2 

Repurchase requests may be made by mail or by contacting the Shareholder s financial intermediary, both subject to certain conditions described in this Plan. If making a repurchase request by contacting the Shareholder s financial
 intermediary, the Shareholder s financial intermediary may require the Shareholder to provide certain documentation or information. If making a repurchase request by mail to the transfer agent, the Shareholder must complete and sign a
 repurchase authorization form, which can be found at the end of this Plan. Written requests should be sent to the transfer agent at the following address:

FCR@fortress.com

 c/o Fortress Investment Group LLC

 PO Box 219090

 Kansas City, MO 64121-9090

 Toll Free Number: 866-966-0155

Corporate investors and other non-individual entities must have an appropriate certification on file authorizing repurchases. A signature guarantee may be required.

For processed repurchases, repurchase proceeds are to be paid by the instructions on file with the transfer agent. Shareholders should check with their broker-dealer that such payment may be made via wire transfer, as further described
 below.

A medallion signature guarantee will be required in certain circumstances described below. A medallion signature guarantee may be obtained from a domestic bank or trust company, broker-dealer, clearing agency, savings association or other
 financial institution which participates in a medallion program recognized by the Securities Transfer Association. The three recognized medallion programs are the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion
 Program and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Medallion Signature Program. Signature guarantees from financial institutions that are not participating in any of these medallion programs will not be accepted. A notary public cannot provide
 signature guarantees. The Company reserves the right to amend, waive or discontinue this policy at any time and establish other criteria for verifying the authenticity of any repurchase or transaction request. The Company may require a
 medallion signature guarantee if, among other reasons: (1) the amount of the repurchase request is over 500,000; (2) a Shareholder wishes to have repurchase proceeds transferred by wire to an account other than the designated bank or
 brokerage account on file for at least 30 days or sent to an address other than such Shareholder s address of record for the past 30 days; or (3) the Company s transfer agent cannot confirm a Shareholder s identity or suspects fraudulent
 activity.

3 

If a Shareholder has made multiple purchases of the Company s common shares, any repurchase request will be processed on a first in/first out basis unless otherwise requested in the repurchase request.

Minimum Account Repurchases

Notwithstanding any Mandatory Holding Period (as defined below), in the event that any Shareholder fails to maintain the minimum balance of 500 of the Company s common shares, the Company may repurchase all of the
 shares held by that Shareholder at the repurchase price in effect on the date the Company determines that such Shareholder has failed to meet the minimum balance, less any Early Repurchase Deduction (in the case of any Class J-4 shares, Class J-5
 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares). Minimum account repurchases will apply even in the event that the failure to meet the minimum balance is caused solely by a decline in the Company s NAV. Minimum account
 repurchases are subject to any Early Repurchase Deduction.

Sources of Funds for Repurchases

The Company may fund repurchase requests from sources other than cash flow
 from operations, including, without limitation, borrowings, offering proceeds (including from sales of the Company s common shares to Fortress Affiliates), sales of the Company s liquid investments, and, if necessary, sales of the Company s
 investments and/or assets, and the Company has no limits on the amounts it may fund from such sources. 

In an effort to have adequate cash available to support this Plan and to fund investments, the Company may reserve borrowing capacity under a line of credit. The Company could then elect to borrow against this line of
 credit in part to repurchase shares presented for repurchase during periods when the Company does not have sufficient proceeds from operating cash flows or the sale of shares in its continuous offering to fund all repurchase requests.

Repurchase Limitations

The Company may repurchase fewer shares than have been requested in any particular quarter to be repurchased under this Plan, or none at all, in its discretion at any time. In addition, the
 aggregate NAV of total repurchases of Class B shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2 shares, Class J-3 shares, Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares (including repurchases
 at certain non-U.S. investor access funds primarily created to hold the Company s common shares but excluding any Early Repurchase Deduction applicable to the repurchased shares) under this Plan will be limited to no more than 5 of the Company s
 aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the average aggregate NAV attributable to Shareholders as of the end of the immediately preceding three months).

In the event that the Company determines to repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any quarter, shares repurchased at the end of the quarter will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted after the start of the next quarter, or upon the recommencement of this Plan, as applicable.

4 

Should repurchase requests, in the Company s judgment, place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should
 the Company otherwise determine that investing its liquid assets in real estate debt investments rather than repurchasing the Company s shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole, the Company may choose to repurchase fewer shares in
 any particular quarter than have been requested to be repurchased (including relative to the 5 quarterly limit under this Plan), or none at all. Further, the Company s board of trustees may make exceptions to, modify or suspend this Plan (including
 to make exceptions to repurchase limitations, or repurchase fewer shares than such repurchase limitations) if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Company and its Shareholders. Material modifications to,
 including any amendment to the 5 quarterly limitation on repurchases, and suspensions of, this Plan will be promptly disclosed to Shareholders financial advisors. In addition, the Company may determine to suspend this Plan due to regulatory
 changes, changes in law or if the Company becomes aware of undisclosed material information that it believes should be publicly disclosed before shares are repurchased. Once this Plan is suspended, the Company s board of trustees will be required to
 consider at least quarterly whether the continued suspension of this Plan is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders. The Company s board of trustees must affirmatively authorize the recommencement of this Plan before Shareholder
 requests will be considered again. The Company s board of trustees cannot terminate this Plan absent a liquidity event which results in Shareholders receiving cash or securities listed on a national securities exchange or where otherwise required by
 law.

Shares held by the Adviser acquired as payment of the Adviser s management fee, performance fee or as reimbursements of expenses will not be subject to the limits of this Plan, any Early Repurchase Deduction or any
 Mandatory Holding Period. Shareholders who are exchanging a class of the Company s shares for an equivalent aggregate NAV of another class of the Company s shares will not be subject to, and will not be treated as repurchases for the calculation of,
 the 5 quarterly limitation on repurchases and will not be subject to any Early Repurchase Deduction or Mandatory Holding Period in respect of any such exchange.

Mandatory Holding Period (Class B Shares, Class R Shares, Class J-1 Shares, Class J-2 Shares and Class J-3 Shares)

Class B shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2 shares and Class J-3 shares may only be repurchased by the Company to the extent they have been outstanding for at least two years (the Mandatory Holding
 Period ). The Mandatory Holding Period is measured as of the first calendar day immediately following the prospective Repurchase Date. The Mandatory Holding Period will not apply to Class B shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2
 shares or Class J-3 shares acquired through the Company s distribution reinvestment plan.

5 

The Company may, from time to time, waive the Mandatory Holding Period in the following circumstances (subject to the conditions described below):

Repurchases resulting from death or qualifying disability; or

In the event that a Shareholder s Class B shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2 shares or Class J-3 shares are repurchased because the Shareholder has failed to maintain the 500 minimum account balance.

As set forth above, the Company may waive the Mandatory Holding Period in respect of repurchase of Class B shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2 shares and Class J-3 shares resulting from the death or
 qualifying disability (as such term is defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code )) of a Shareholder who is a natural person, including such shares held by such Shareholder through a trust or
 an individual retirement account (IRA) or other retirement or profit-sharing plan, after (i) in the case of death, receiving written notice from the estate of the Shareholder, the recipient of such shares through bequest or inheritance, or, in the
 case of a trust, the trustee of such trust, who shall have the sole ability to request repurchase on behalf of the trust or (ii) in the case of qualified disability, receiving written notice from such Shareholder along with a physician s
 certification of disability as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Code; provided that the condition causing the qualifying disability was not pre-existing on the date that the Shareholder became a Shareholder. The Company must receive the written
 repurchase request within 12 months after the death of the Shareholder or the initial determination of the Shareholder s disability in order for the requesting party to rely on any of the special treatment described above that may be afforded in the
 event of the death or disability of a Shareholder. In the case of death, such a written request must be accompanied by a certified copy of the official death certificate of the Shareholder. If spouses are joint registered holders of any Class B
 shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2 shares or Class J-3 shares, the request to have such shares repurchased may be made if either of the registered holders dies or acquires a qualified disability. If the Shareholder is not a natural
 person, such as certain trusts or a partnership, corporation or other similar entity, the right to waiver of the Mandatory Holding Period upon death or disability does not apply.

In addition, Class B shares may be sold to certain feeder vehicles primarily created to hold such shares that in turn offer interests in such feeder vehicles to non-U.S. persons. For such feeder vehicles and similar
 arrangements in certain markets, the Company may agree not to apply the Mandatory Holding Period to the feeder vehicles or underlying investors, often because of administrative or systems limitations. Further, the Company will not apply the Mandatory
 Holding Period on repurchases of any Class B shares or Class R shares submitted by discretionary model portfolio management programs (and similar arrangements) as approved by the Company.

Early Repurchase Deduction

For Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares, there is no minimum holding period and Shareholders holding any such shares can request that the Company
 repurchase such shares at any time. However, subject to limited exceptions, Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased
 at 98 of the Transaction Price (an Early Repurchase Deduction on the applicable Repurchase Date. The one-year holding period is measured as of the first calendar day immediately following the prospective Repurchase Date. This Early
 Repurchase Deduction will also generally apply to minimum account repurchases. The Early Repurchase Deduction will not apply to (i) Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares acquired through
 the Company s distribution reinvestment plan and (ii) Class B shares, Class R shares, Class J-1 shares, Class J-2 shares and Class J-3 shares which cannot be repurchased during the Mandatory Holding Period.

6 

The Company may, from time to time, waive the Early Repurchase Deduction in the following circumstances (subject to the conditions described below):

Repurchases resulting from death or qualifying disability; or

In the event that a Shareholder s Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares or Class E shares are repurchased because such Shareholder has failed to maintain the 500 minimum account balance.

As set forth above, the Company may waive the Early Repurchase Deduction in respect of repurchases of Class J-4 shares, Class J-5 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares and Class E shares resulting from
 the death or qualifying disability (as such term is defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Code) of a Shareholder who is a natural person, including such shares held by such Shareholder through a trust or an individual retirement account (IRA) or other
 retirement or profit-sharing plan, after (i) in the case of death, receiving written notice from the estate of the Shareholder, the recipient of such shares through bequest or inheritance, or, in the case of a trust, the trustee of such trust, who
 shall have the sole ability to request repurchase on behalf of the trust or (ii) in the case of qualified disability, receiving written notice from such Shareholder along with a physician s certification of disability as defined in Section 72(m)(7)
 of the Code; provided that the condition causing the qualifying disability was not pre-existing on the date that the Shareholder became a Shareholder. The Company must receive the written repurchase request
 within 12 months after the death of the Shareholder or the initial determination of the Shareholder s disability in order for the requesting party to rely on any of the special treatment described above that may be afforded in the event of the death
 or disability of a Shareholder. In the case of death, such a written request must be accompanied by a certified copy of the official death certificate of the Shareholder. If spouses are joint registered holders of any Class J-4 shares, Class J-5
 shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares or Class E shares, the request to have such shares repurchased may be made if either of the registered holders dies or acquires a qualified disability. If the Shareholder is not a natural person,
 such as certain trusts or a partnership, corporation or other similar entity, the right to waiver of the Early Repurchase Deduction upon death or disability does not apply.

In addition, Class I shares may be sold to certain feeder vehicles primarily created to hold the Company s shares that in turn offer interests in such feeder vehicles to non-U.S. persons. For such feeder vehicles and
 similar arrangements in certain markets, the Company may agree not to apply the Early Repurchase Deduction to the feeder vehicles or underlying investors, often because of administrative or systems limitations. Further, the Company will not apply the
 Early Repurchase Deduction on repurchases of any Class S shares, Class D shares, Class I shares or Class E shares submitted by discretionary model portfolio management programs (and similar arrangements) as approved by the Company.

7 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any shares held by the Adviser acquired as payment of the Adviser s management fee or performance fee will not be subject to the limits of this
 Plan, including the Early Repurchase Deduction. Shareholders who are exchanging any class of shares for an equivalent aggregate NAV of another class of shares will not be subject to, and such exchanges will not be treated as repurchases for the
 calculation of, the 5 quarterly limitation on repurchases and will not be subject to the Early Repurchase Deduction. 

Fortress Initial Capitalization

Fortress Investment Group LLC may, from time to time, request to have any Class E shares it receives in connection with the Initial Capitalization (as defined in the Company s confidential private placement memorandum,
 as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time) repurchased by the Company at a price per share equal to the most recently determined NAV per Class E share as of the repurchase date. Any such repurchase will not be subject to the Early
 Repurchase Deduction.

Items of Note

If a Shareholder requests that some but not all of his or her shares be repurchased, such Shareholder should keep his or her balance above 500 to avoid minimum account repurchase, if applicable;

Shareholders will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed repurchase checks;

Under applicable anti-money laundering regulations and other federal regulations, repurchase requests may be suspended, restricted or canceled and the proceeds may be withheld; and

All common shares of the Company requested to be repurchased must be beneficially owned by the Shareholder of record making the request or his or her estate, heir or beneficiary, or the party requesting the repurchase must be authorized to
 do so by the Shareholder of record of the shares or his or her estate, heir or beneficiary, and such common shares must be fully transferable and not subject to any liens or encumbrances. In certain cases, the Company may ask the requesting
 party to provide evidence satisfactory to the Company that the shares requested for repurchase are not subject to any liens or encumbrances. If the Company determines that a lien exists against the shares, the Company will not be obligated to
 repurchase any shares subject to the lien.

Frequent Trading and Other Policies

The Company may reject for any reason, or cancel as permitted or required by law, any purchase orders for its common shares. For example, the Company may reject any purchase orders from market timers or investors that,
 in the Company s opinion, may be disruptive to its operations. Frequent purchases and sales of the Company s shares can harm Shareholders in . various ways, including reducing the returns to long-term Shareholders by increasing the Company s costs, disrupting portfolio management strategies and diluting the value of the shares of long-term Shareholders.

8 

In general, Shareholders may request that the Company repurchase their shares once every 30 days. However, the Company prohibits frequent trading. The Company defines frequent trading as follows:

Any Shareholder who requests that the Company repurchase common shares within 30 calendar days of the purchase of such common shares;

Transactions deemed harmful or excessive by the Company (including, but not limited to, patterns of purchases and repurchases), in the Company s sole discretion; and

Transactions initiated by financial advisors, among multiple Shareholder accounts, that in the aggregate are deemed harmful or excessive.

The following are excluded when determining whether transactions are excessive:

Purchases and requests for repurchase of the Company s shares in the amount of 2,500 or less;

Purchases or repurchases initiated by the Company; and

Transactions subject to the trading policy of an intermediary that the Company deems materially similar to the Company s policy.

At the Dealer Manager s discretion, upon the first violation of the policy in a calendar year, purchase and repurchase privileges may be suspended for 90 days. Upon a second violation in a calendar year, purchase and
 repurchase privileges may be suspended for 180 days. On the next business day following the end of the 90 or 180-day suspension, any transaction restrictions placed on a Shareholder may be removed.

Mail and Telephone Instructions

The Company and its transfer agent will not be responsible for the authenticity of mail or phone instructions or losses, if any, resulting from unauthorized Shareholder transactions if they
 reasonably believe that such instructions were genuine. The Company s transfer agent has established reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine including requiring the Shareholder to provide certain specific identifying
 information on file and sending written confirmation to Shareholders of record. Shareholders, or their designated custodian or fiduciary, should carefully review such correspondence to ensure that the instructions were properly acted upon. If any
 discrepancies are noted, the Shareholder, or its agent, should contact his, her or its financial advisor as well as the Company s transfer agent in a timely manner, but in no event more than 60 days from receipt of such correspondence. Failure to
 notify such entities in a timely manner will relieve the Company, the Company s transfer agent and the financial advisor of any liability with respect to the discrepancy.

 shared with or allocated to one or more other Fortress Managed Accounts (in lieu of the Company) in accordance with Fortress s prevailing policies and procedures and (iii) certain Fortress Managed Accounts will receive priority over the Company with
 respect to investments within such accounts investment objectives and guidelines as described in the Memorandum and the Adviser will not allocate investment opportunities to the Company unless the investment advisers of such Fortress Managed

(c) In connection with the services of the Adviser hereunder, the Company and the Board of Trustees acknowledge and agree that (i) as part of
 Fortress s regular businesses, personnel of the Adviser and its Affiliates may from time-to-time work on other projects and matters (including with respect to one or more other Fortress Managed Accounts), and that conflicts may arise with respect to
 the allocation of personnel between the Company and one or more other Fortress Managed Accounts and/or the Adviser and such other Affiliates as described in the Memorandum, (ii) unless prohibited by the Declaration of Trust, other Fortress Managed
 Accounts may invest, from time to time, in investments in which the Company also invests (including at a different level of an issuer s capital structure e.g ., an investment by an other Fortress Managed
 Account in a mezzanine debt interest with respect to the same issuer to whom the Company has made a mortgage loan)) and while the Adviser will seek to resolve any such conflicts in a fair and reasonable manner (subject to any priorities of any other
 Fortress Managed Accounts) in accordance with its prevailing policies and procedures with respect to conflicts resolution among other Fortress Managed Accounts generally, such transactions are not required to be presented to the Board of Trustees or
 any committee thereof for approval (unless otherwise required by the Declaration of Trust or the Investment Guidelines), and there can be no assurance that any conflicts will be resolved in the Company s favor, (iii) the Company will from time to
 time pay fees to the Adviser and its Affiliates, including portfolio entities of other Fortress Managed Accounts, for providing various services described in the Memorandum (collectively, Services ),
 which fees will be in addition to the compensation paid to the Adviser pursuant to Section 9 , (iv) the Adviser and its Affiliates may from time to time receive fees from portfolio entities or other issuers for providing Services, including
 with respect to other Fortress Managed Accounts and related portfolio entities, and while such fees may give rise to conflicts of interest, the Company will not receive the benefit of any such fees, and (v) the terms and conditions of the governing
 agreements of such other Fortress Managed Accounts (including with respect to the economic, reporting, and other rights afforded to investors in such other Fortress Managed Accounts) are materially different from the terms and conditions applicable
 to the Company and the Shareholders, and neither the Company nor the Shareholders (in such capacity) shall have the right to receive the benefit of any such different terms applicable to investors in such other Fortress Managed Accounts as a result
 of an investment in the Company or otherwise. The Adviser shall keep the Board of Trustees reasonably informed on a periodic basis in connection with the foregoing.

8 

(d) The prior approval of a majority of the Trustees not otherwise interested in the transaction will be required for each transaction to which the
 Adviser or its Affiliates is a party; provided, however , that (i) no approval by the Board of Trustees shall be required for transactions with other Fortress Managed Accounts, in the event of a purchase of an
 asset from the other Fortress Managed Account, at a price no greater than, and, in the event of a sale to a Fortress Managed Account, at a price no less than, fair market value of such asset as confirmed by (x) an independent third-party valuation
 agent or (y) a broker; (ii) the Adviser may cause the Company to co-invest alongside a Fortress A liate, including in the acquisition of a portfolio of commercial real estate debt and residential loans and assets from the same seller. The Adviser
 may, in its discretion, allocate the assets from such portfolio and the associated purchase price between the Company and such Fortress A liate, and no approval of the Board of Trustees will be required for such transaction. The purchase price paid
 by the Company for any asset from such portfolio that is allocated to the Company shall be no greater than its fair market value as confirmed by (x) an independent third-party valuation agent or (y) a broker; (iii) the Adviser may cause the Company
 and other Fortress A liates, from time to time, to combine one or more assets into a securitization vehicle the equity of which is allocated on a pro rata basis among the Company and such Fortress A liates based on asset valuations, and where the
 valuations are (x) confirmed by an independent third-party valuation agent or (y) approved by the Board of Trustees; (iv) the Adviser shall obtain the approval of the Board of Trustees in respect of any purchase by the Company of a New Issuance of
 the issuer of a structured product unless (a) at the time of such purchase (A) the issuer is not a Fortress Affiliate or controlled by a Fortress Affiliate and (B) no Affiliated Service Company is engaged by the issuer, or (b) (x) a Fortress
 Affiliate proposes to purchase at such time a larger percentage of the same class or tranche (or multiple classes or tranches in similar proportions) of such New Issuance than the Adviser proposes for the Company to purchase, and the advisory board,
 independent board of directors (or committee thereof) or the third-party investors (or equivalent, as applicable) of such Fortress Affiliate has approved such purchase on the same terms as the Company, and (y) the Adviser determines in good faith
 that (A) the conflict of interest with respect to the Company is substantially the same as the conflict of interest with respect to such Fortress Affiliate and (B) there is no material conflict of interest as between the Company, on the one hand, and
 such Fortress Affiliate, on the other; and (v) the Company may enter into joint ventures (or enter into joint acquisitions of or dispositions of jointly held assets) with other Fortress Managed Accounts, or with Fortress, the Adviser, or any of their
 respective Affiliates without approval of the Board of Trustees (unless otherwise required by the Declaration of Trust or the Investment Guidelines).

The Adviser will seek to resolve any conflicts of interest in a fair and reasonable manner (subject to any priorities of certain Fortress Managed Accounts) in accordance with its prevailing policies and procedures with
 respect to conflicts resolution among other Fortress Managed Accounts generally, but only those transactions expressly requiring prior approval pursuant to this Section 7(d) shall be required to be presented for approval to the
 majority of the Trustees or any committee thereof (unless otherwise required by the Declaration of Trust or the Investment Guidelines).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that neither the Company nor the Board of Trustees has the authority to determine the salary, bonus
 or any other compensation paid by the Adviser to any director, officer, member, partner, employee, or stockholder of the Adviser or its Affiliates, including any person who is also a Trustee, officer or employee of the Company.

8. RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS . Subject to Section 7 and to restrictions advisable with respect to the qualification of the
 Company as a REIT, directors, managers, officers and employees of the Adviser or an Affiliate of the Adviser or any corporate parent of an Affiliate, may serve as a Trustee or officer of the Company, except that (a) such director, manager, officer or
 employee of the Adviser shall be deemed to be acting in such capacity solely for the Company, and not as a director, manager, officer or employee of the Adviser, and (b) no director, manager, officer or employee of the Adviser or an Affiliate of the
 Adviser who also is a Trustee or officer of the Company shall receive any compensation from the Company for serving as a Trustee or officer other than (i) reasonable reimbursement for travel and related expenses incurred in attending meetings of the
 Board of Trustees or (ii) as otherwise approved by the Board of Trustees.

9. COMPENSATION .

(a) Management Fee . The Company will pay the Adviser a management fee (the Management Fee ), equal to (i) for Class J-4 Common Shares, Class J-5 Common Shares, Class S Common Shares, Class D Common Shares and Class I Common Shares, 1.25 of NAV per annum payable monthly, and (ii)
 for Class B Common Shares, Class R Common Shares, Class J-1 Common Shares, Class J-2 Common Shares, Class J-3 Common Shares and Class E Common Shares, 1.00 of NAV per annum payable monthly, in each case, before giving effect to any accruals of the
 Management Fee, the Performance Fee, ongoing servicing fees or any Distributions. The Adviser shall receive the Management Fee as compensation for services rendered hereunder. The Adviser has agreed to waive the Management Fee in respect of any
 Class B Common Shares that are purchased by a Shareholder during the Initial Share Offering Period, in respect of any Class R Common Shares that are purchased by a Shareholder during the Class R Share Offering Period, and in respect of any Class J-1
 Common Shares, Class J-2 Common Shares or Class J-3 Common Shares that are purchased by a Shareholder through the Initial Sales Program, in each case until March 31, 2025 (including any Shares issued pursuant to any distribution reinvestment plan
 with respect to such waiver-eligible Shares). In addition, the Management Fee paid to the Adviser in respect of any Class E Common Shares shall be subject to the Company s ability to meet the applicable REIT requirements (which may require that such
 Management Fee is waived prior to March 31, 2025 if the Company is not a publicly offered REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and shall be waived by the Adviser following the time that the Company becomes a publicly offered REIT for U.S.
 federal income tax purposes. Any Management Fee shall be calculated and paid to the Adviser on a class-by-class basis, based on the NAV of each applicable class of the Company s Shares.

(b) Performance Fee . The Company shall pay the Adviser a performance fee (the Performance Fee ), which is accrued monthly and payable quarterly (or part thereof that this Agreement is in effect) in arrears. The Performance Fee shall be an amount, not less than zero, equal to 12.5 of
 Core Earnings for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on Adjusted Capital, equal to 1.25 per quarter (the hurdle rate ), or an annualized hurdle
 rate of 5.0 . As a result, the Adviser does not earn a performance fee for any quarter until Core Earnings for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.25 . Once Core Earnings in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, the Adviser shall be entitled to
 a catch-up fee equal to the amount of Core Earnings in excess of the hurdle rate, until Core Earnings for such quarter exceeds a percentage of Adjusted Capital equal to the hurdle rate divided by 0.875 (or 1 minus 0.125) for such quarter.
 Thereafter, the Adviser shall be entitled to receive 12.5 of Core Earnings. The Performance Fee shall be calculated based on the full Management Fee earned and regardless of whether the Adviser elects to receive such fee in cash or Class E Common
 Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not pay the Adviser a performance fee on Class B Common Shares, Class R Common Shares, Class J-1 Common Shares, Class J-2 Common Shares, Class J-3 Common Shares or Class E Common Shares, and as a
 result, it is a class-specific expense.

10 

(c) The Management Fee and Performance Fee may be paid, at the Adviser s election, subject to the ownership restrictions in the Declaration of Trust,
 in cash or cash equivalent aggregate NAV amounts of Class E Common Shares, or any combination thereof. If the Adviser elects to receive any portion of its Management Fee or Performance Fee in Class E Common Shares, the Adviser or any subsequent
 transferee thereof may elect to have the Company repurchase such Class E Common Shares from the Adviser or such transferee at a later date at a repurchase price per Class E Common Share equal to the then NAV per Class E Common Share. Class E Common
 Shares obtained by the Adviser or any subsequent transferee will not be subject to the repurchase limits of the Company s share repurchase plan (as in effect from time to time), including the repurchase limits or any reduction or penalty for an early
 repurchase. The Adviser or any subsequent transferee will have the option of exchanging Class E Common Shares for an equivalent aggregate NAV amount of any other currently offered class of the Company s Shares.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated or its term expires without renewal, the Adviser will be entitled to receive each of its prorated
 Management Fee and Performance Fee through the date of termination. Such proration shall take into account the number of days of any partial calendar month or calendar year for which this Agreement was in effect.

(e) In the event the Company commences a liquidation of its Investments during any calendar year, the Company will pay the Adviser the Management Fee
 and the Performance Fee from the proceeds of the liquidation.

10. EXPENSES .

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Administration Agreement, the Adviser shall be responsible for the expenses related to any and all
 personnel of the Adviser who provide investment advisory services to the Company pursuant to this Agreement (including each of the officers of the Company and any Trustees who are also directors, officers or employees of the Adviser or any of its
 Affiliates), including salaries, bonus and other wages, payroll taxes and the cost of employee benefit plans of such personnel, and costs of insurance with respect to such personnel Adviser Expenses ).

 Fee. Any such arrangements will be at or below market rates.

14 

Such services may be provided by the Adviser s Affiliates to the Company and other Fortress Managed Accounts. In particular, the Adviser s Affiliates will provide asset management services, including
 certain mortgage-related services, to the Company and other Fortress Managed Accounts, which services may include credit evaluation of the properties securing the Investments, services related to mortgage servicing, consulting/brokerage, capital
 markets/credit origination, and loan servicing, monitoring Company management and operations where appropriate, monitoring the progress of construction and development of properties, including build-to-suit properties, and tracking of payment
 obligations and cash payments. The Adviser shall have the right to cause Fortress in-house legal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, compliance) services for the Company to be rendered by employees of Fortress or its Affiliates, and the Company
 shall pay or reimburse Fortress or its Affiliates performing such services for the cost thereof. The Company shall bear all costs and expenses of the Adviser s Affiliates (other than the costs and expenses of Affiliated Service Companies) that are
 directly attributable to the salaries, bonuses and fringe benefits payable to employees of the Adviser s Affiliates performing asset management services whose work is provided solely to the Company and all costs and expenses of information systems,
 software and hardware utilized solely by the Company in connection with asset management. For any asset management services provided to the Company and other Fortress Managed Accounts, the Company shall bear its allocable share of such costs and
 expenses, as well as all costs and expenses of information systems, software and hardware utilized by the Company and other Fortress Managed Accounts in connection with asset management, such allocable share to be based on the relative values of the
 specific assets of the Company and other Fortress Managed Accounts for which asset management services are being provided. For the avoidance of doubt, if as part of his/her responsibilities, an employee of the Adviser s Affiliate performs functions
 in addition to asset management services, the Company shall only be responsible for the reimbursement of the allocable portion of the employee s salary, bonus and fringe benefits corresponding to the employee s time spent devoted to asset management
 services.

To the extent other services enumerated above are provided by the Adviser s Affiliates to the Company and other Fortress Managed Accounts, the Adviser shall allocate the costs and expenses related to
 such services among the Company and such other Fortress Managed Accounts in a manner that the Adviser, in its discretion, determines is fair and reasonable.

(d) The Adviser may, at its option, elect not to seek reimbursement for certain expenses during a given period, which determination shall not be
 deemed to construe a waiver of reimbursement for similar expenses in future periods.

(e) Any reimbursement to the Adviser may be paid, at the Adviser s election, in cash or Class E Common Shares, or any combination thereof, and may be
 offset by the Adviser against amounts due to the Company from the Adviser. Cost and expense reimbursement to the Adviser shall be subject to adjustment at the end of each calendar year in connection with the annual audit of the Company.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser shall pay for all Organization and Offering Expenses (other than servicing fees) incurred prior to
 the first anniversary of the initial closing of the Company s initial Offering. All Organization and Offering Expenses (other than servicing fees) paid by the Adviser pursuant to this Section 10 shall be reimbursed by the Company to the
 Adviser in 60 equal monthly installments commencing with the first anniversary of the initial closing of the Company s initial Offering; provided , that in the event the Company commences a Liquidation, all
 such Organization and Offering Expenses shall become due and payable and shall be reimbursed by the Company to the Adviser in connection with, and prior to the completion of, such Liquidation.

15 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Adviser may pay for certain of the costs and expenses of the Company contemplated by this Section

 10 (excluding Organization and Offering Expenses) and by the Administration Agreement incurred through the earlier of (i) the first date that the Company s aggregate NAV is at least 300 million and (ii) December 31, 2024. All such costs and
 expenses paid by the Adviser pursuant to this Section 10(g) shall be reimbursed by the Company to the Adviser in 60 equal monthly installments following such date; provided , that in the event the
 Company commences a Liquidation, all such costs and expenses shall become due and payable and shall be reimbursed by the Company to the Adviser in connection with, and prior to the completion of, such Liquidation.

11. OTHER SERVICES . Should the Board of Trustees request that the Adviser or any director, officer or employee thereof render services for the Company
 other than those set forth in Section 3 , such services shall be separately compensated at such rates and in such amounts as are agreed by the Adviser and the Board of Trustees, subject to the limitations contained in the Declaration of Trust,
 and shall not be deemed to be services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

12. ADVISER AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR . The Adviser shall for all purposes herein provided be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as
 expressly provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Company in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Company.

13. NO JOINT VENTURE . The Company, on the one hand, and the Adviser on the other, are not partners or joint venturers with each other, and nothing in
 this Agreement shall be construed to make them such partners or joint venturers or impose any liability as such on either of them.

14. TERM OF AGREEMENT . This Agreement shall continue in force for a period of two years from the Effective Date, subject to an unlimited number of
 successive one-year renewals upon approval of a majority of the Trustees and a majority of the Independent Trustees. It is the duty of the Board of Trustees to evaluate the performance of the Adviser annually before renewing the Agreement, and each
 such renewal shall be for a term of no more than one year.

15. TERMINATION BY THE PARTIES . This Agreement may be terminated upon 60 days written notice without penalty by approval of a majority of the
 Trustees; or upon 60 days written notice by the Adviser. The provisions of Sections 17 through 20 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

16. ASSIGNMENTS . This Agreement may be assigned by the Adviser to an Affiliate of the Adviser with the approval of a majority of the Trustees
 (including a majority of the Independent Trustees). The Adviser may assign any rights to receive fees or other payments under this Agreement to any Person without obtaining the consent of the Board of Trustees. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
 the Company without the approval of the Adviser, except in the case of an assignment by the Company to a corporation or other organization which is a successor to all of the assets, rights and obligations of the Company, in which case such successor
 organization shall be bound hereunder and by the terms of said assignment in the same manner as the Company is bound by this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding on successors to the Company resulting from a change in control or sale of all or
 substantially all the assets of the Company and shall likewise be binding on any successor to the Adviser. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.15 of the Declaration of Trust, the consent of the Company to a transaction that would
 result in any assignment (within the meaning of the Advisers Act) of this Agreement by the Adviser may be provided by (a) the vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees and (b) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees.

16 

17. PAYMENTS TO AND DUTIES OF ADVISER UPON TERMINATION .

(a) After the Termination Date, the Adviser shall not be entitled to compensation for further services hereunder except it shall be entitled to
 receive from the Company within 30 days after the effective date of such termination all unpaid reimbursements of expenses and all earned but unpaid fees payable to the Adviser prior to termination of this Agreement.

(b) The Adviser shall promptly upon termination:

(i) pay over to the Company all money collected and held for the account of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, after
 deducting any accrued compensation and reimbursement for its expenses to which it is then entitled;

(ii) deliver to the Board of Trustees a full accounting, including a statement showing all payments collected by it and a
 statement of all money held by it, covering the period following the date of the last accounting furnished to the Board of Trustees;

(iii) deliver to the Board of Trustees all assets, including all Investments, and documents of the Company then in the custody of
 the Adviser; and

(iv) cooperate with, and take all reasonable actions requested by, the Company and Board of Trustees in making an orderly
 transition of the advisory function.

18. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY .

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitees shall not be liable to the Company for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
 Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of the Company, and the Company shall indemnify and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitees
 from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnitees in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit,
 investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of the Company or its security holders) arising from any actual or alleged act or omission to act performed or omitted by it in connection with any matter arising out
 of or in connection with this Agreement, the Company s business or affairs or any investment made or held by the Company, or otherwise as an investment advisor of the Company, and for any losses due to any actual or alleged act or omission to act of
 any broker, agent, counsel or accountant of the Company (provided that the selection, engagement or retention of such broker, agent, counsel or accountant by the Indemnitee did not constitute Disabling
 Conduct), in each case except for any such losses primarily attributable to such Indemnitee s Disabling Conduct. An Indemnitee may, in good faith, consult with counsel and accountants and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, will be
 fully protected and justified in any actual or alleged act or omission to act which is taken, in good faith, in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants so long as the selection, engagement or retention of such counsel or
 accountant did not constitute Disabling Conduct.

17 

(b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Adviser nor any if its Affiliates shall
 (i) be or be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement, or of any duty owed by the Adviser or such Affiliate to the Company with respect to any actual or potential conflict of interests, or (ii) have or be deemed to have any liability to the Company,
 in each case in respect of any act or omission to act (x) specifically authorized by this Agreement, (y) approved by the Board of Trustees or (z) approved by a majority in interest of Shareholders, and neither the Adviser nor any if its Affiliates
 shall be held responsible for any action of the Board of Trustees in following or declining to follow any advice or recommendation given by the Advisor.

(c) The Company shall (i) advance to each Indemnitee, or (ii) promptly reimburse each Indemnitee for, all expenses (including fees and expenses of
 counsel) incurred in connection with investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending any proceeding related to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Company s business or affairs or any investment made or held by the Company; provided that such Indemnitee shall promptly repay to the Company the amount of any such advanced or reimbursed expenses paid to it if it shall be judicially determined by judgment or order not subject to further
 appeal or discretionary review that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under the terms of this Agreement. If for any reason (other than such Indemnitee s Disabling Conduct) the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any
 Indemnitee, or insufficient to hold it harmless, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
 relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and such Indemnitee, on the other hand, or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also any other relevant
 equitable considerations.

(d) The indemnification provided by this Section 18 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may
 be entitled under any agreement, as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity.

(e) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 18 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
 transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement and the Declaration of Trust.

(f) The provisions of this Section 18 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall
 not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

18 

19. NON-SOLICITATION . In the event of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 15 , for two years after the
 Termination Date, the Company shall not, without the consent of the Adviser, employ or otherwise retain any employee of the Adviser or any of its Affiliates or any person who has been employed by the Adviser or any of its Affiliates at any time
 within the two year period immediately preceding the date on which such person commences employment with or is otherwise retained by the Company. The Company acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to any damages, the Adviser may be entitled to
 equitable relief for any violation of this Section 19 by the Company, including injunctive relief.

(c) Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Dealer Manager all compensation to which the

13. Confirmation . The Company hereby agrees and assumes the duty to confirm, on its behalf and on behalf of the Participating Broker-Dealers
 who sell the Shares, all orders for purchase of Shares accepted by the Company. Such confirmations will comply with the rules of the SEC and FINRA, and will comply with applicable laws of such other jurisdictions to the extent the Company is advised
 of such laws in writing by the Dealer Manager.

14. Memorandum and Authorized Sales Materials . The Dealer Manager agrees that it is not authorized or permitted to give, and will not any
 information or make any representation concerning the Shares, except as set forth in the Memorandum and any Authorized Sales Materials. The Dealer Manager further agrees (i) not to deliver any Authorized Sales Materials to any investor or prospective

 supplemented, (ii) not to show or give to any investor or prospective investor or reproduce any material or writing that is supplied to it by the Company and marked dealer only or otherwise bearing a legend denoting that it is not to be used in
 connection with the sale of Shares to members of the public and (iii) not to show or give to any investor or prospective investor in a particular jurisdiction (and will similarly require Participating Broker-Dealers pursuant to the Participating
 Broker-Dealer Agreement) any material or writing that is supplied to it by the Company if such material bears a legend denoting that it is not to be used in connection with the sale of Shares to members of the public in such jurisdiction. Dealer
 Manager, in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers, will include requirements and obligations of the Participating Broker-Dealers similar to those imposed upon the Dealer Manager pursuant to this Section 14. The Dealer Manager agrees that
 the Company shall be permitted to deliver at any time, and from time to time, notice (including via email) that any materials that constitute Authorized Sales Materials shall no longer be used and no longer constitute Authorized Sales Materials for
 purposes of this Agreement. Following receipt of such notice, the Dealer Manager shall immediately cease using such Authorized Sales Materials and notify each Participating Broker-Dealer to cease using such Authorized Sales Materials immediately.

22 

15. Submission of Orders .

(a) Each person desiring to purchase Shares in the Offering will be required to complete and execute a Subscription Agreement and
 to deliver to the Participating Broker-Dealer or Dealer Manager, as the case may be (the Processing Broker Dealer ), such completed Subscription Agreement, together with a check, draft, wire or money order (a Subscription Payment for the purchase price of the Shares. The Dealer Manager shall ensure that any Participating Broker-Dealer shall only offer to sell and accept Subscription Agreements and Subscription Payments for classes of Shares that it is authorized to sell
 pursuant to the Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement (including any schedules or exhibits thereto) and for classes of Shares that are being issued and sold by the Company at such time. There shall be a minimum initial purchase by any one purchaser
 for each class of Shares of 25,000 (except as otherwise indicated in the Memorandum, or in any letter or memorandum from the Company to the Dealer Manager). Minimum subsequent purchases of any such class of Shares shall be 500 per transaction. The
 minimum subsequent investment amount does not apply to purchases made under the distribution reinvestment plan.

(b) The Company will initially offer the Shares on a continuous basis at a price equal to the most recently determined NAV per
 Share for the Class E common shares issued to Fortress in connection with the Company s Initial Capitalization (as described in the Memorandum) (which is deemed to be 20.00 until the last calendar day of the month during which the Company makes its
 first investment). Thereafter, the purchase price for the Shares will be sold at the then-current transaction price, which will generally be equal to the Company s prior month s net asset value per share applicable to the class of Shares being
 purchased (as calculated in accordance with the procedures described in the Memorandum), or at a different offering price made available to investors in cases where the Company believes there has been a material change to the NAV per Share since the
 end of the prior month, plus in either case any applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees, subject in certain circumstances to reductions thereof as described in the Memorandum. The offering price for each class of Shares is subject to
 adjustment as described in the Memorandum. Each person desiring to purchase Shares in the Offering must submit subscriptions for a certain dollar amount, rather than a number of Shares, and, as a result, may receive fractional Shares. Subscription
 Agreements and instruments of payment will be transmitted by the Dealer Manager to the Company or its designated agent as set forth in the Subscription Agreement, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than the end of the next business
 day following receipt by the Dealer Manager.

23 

(c) The Processing Broker-Dealer receiving a Subscription Agreement and Subscription Payment not conforming to the foregoing
 instructions shall return such Subscription Agreement and Subscription Payment directly to such subscriber not later than the end of the second business day following rejection by the Processing Broker-Dealer of such materials. Subscription
 Agreements and Subscription Payments received by the Processing Broker-Dealer that conform to the foregoing instructions shall be transmitted to the Company or its designated agent as set forth in the Subscription Agreement, pursuant to one of the
 methods described in this Section 15 . Transmittal of Subscription Payments will be made in accordance with the following procedures.

(d) If the Processing Broker-Dealer conducts its internal supervisory review at the same location at which Subscription Agreements
 and Subscription Payments are received from subscribers, then, by noon of the next business day following receipt by the Processing Broker-Dealer, the Processing Broker-Dealer will transmit the Subscription Agreements and Subscription Payments to the
 Company or its designated agent as set forth in the Subscription Agreement.

(e) If the Processing Broker-Dealer conducts its internal supervisory review at a different location (the Final Review Office ),
 Subscription Agreements and Subscription Payments will be transmitted by the Processing Broker-Dealer to the Final Review Office by noon of the next business day following receipt by the Processing Broker-Dealer. The Final Review Office will, in
 turn, by noon of the next business day following receipt by the Final Review Office, transmit such Subscription Agreements and Subscription Payments to the Company or its designated agent as set forth in the Subscription Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shares to be purchased by a custodial account, the Processing Broker-Dealer shall cause the custodian of such account to deliver a completed
 Subscription Agreement and Subscription Payment for such account directly to the Company or its designated agent as set forth in the Subscription Agreement. The Processing Broker Dealer shall furnish to the Company and the Adviser, with each delivery
 of Subscription Payments, a list of the subscribers showing the name, U.S. address, tax identification number, state of residence, amount of Shares subscribed for and the amount of the Subscription Payment, together with copy of each completed
 Subscription Agreement.

16. Suitability of Investors; Compliance with Privacy Laws .

(a) The Dealer Manager will offer Shares, and in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers will require that the
 Participating Broker-Dealers offer Shares, only to those persons who meet the suitability standards set forth in the Memorandum or in any suitability letter or memorandum sent by the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, only from investors
 each of which, together with any other investor for which such investor is acting as a trustee or other fiduciary, the Dealer Manager or Participating Broker-Dealer making such offering of Shares, shall reasonably believe (a) is an accredited
 investor with respect to the Shares within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act; or (b) is not a United States person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the Securities Act) and will only make offers to persons in the jurisdictions
 in which it is advised in writing by the Company that the Shares are qualified for sale or that such qualification is not required. Notwithstanding the qualification of the Shares for sale in any respective jurisdiction (or the exemption therefrom),
 the Dealer Manager represents, warrants and covenants (and, in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers, the Dealer Manager will require each Participating Broker-Dealer to represent, warrant and covenant) that it will not offer Shares and
 will not permit any of its registered representatives to offer Shares in any jurisdiction unless both the Dealer Manager and such registered representative are duly licensed to transact securities business in such jurisdiction. In offering Shares,
 the Dealer Manager will comply, and in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers the Dealer Manager will require that the Participating Broker Dealers comply, with the provisions of the FINRA Rules, as well as all other applicable rules and
 regulations relating to suitability of investors.

24 

(b) The Dealer Manager further represents, warrants and covenants, and in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers the
 Dealer Manager will require such Participating Broker-Dealers to represent, warrant and covenant that neither it, nor any person associated with it, shall offer or sell Shares in any jurisdiction, except to investors who satisfy the investor
 suitability standards and minimum investment requirements under the most restrictive of the following: (i) applicable provisions described in the Memorandum, including status as an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities
 Act, minimum income and net worth standards; (ii) applicable laws of the jurisdiction of which such investor is a resident; or (iii) applicable FINRA Rules. The Dealer Manager agrees to ensure that, and in its agreements with Participating
 Broker-Dealers the Dealer Manager will require such Participating Broker-Dealers to ensure that, in recommending the purchase, sale or exchange of Shares to an investor, it, or a person associated with it, shall have reasonable grounds to believe, on
 the basis of information obtained from the investor (and thereafter maintained in the manner and for the period required by the SEC, any state securities commission, FINRA or the Company) concerning the investor s age, investment objectives, other
 investments, financial situation and needs and any other information known to it, or persons associated with it, that (a) the investor can reasonably benefit from an investment in the Shares based on the investor s overall investment objectives and
 portfolio structure, (b) the investor is able to bear the economic risk of the investment based on the investor s overall financial situation and (c) the investor has an apparent understanding of (A) the fundamental risks of the investment, (B) the
 risk that the investor may lose his or her entire investment in the Shares, (C) the lack of liquidity of the Shares, (D) the background and qualifications of the Adviser or the persons responsible for directing and managing the Company and (E) the
 tax consequences of an investment in the Shares. In the case of sales to fiduciary accounts, the suitability standards must be met by the person who directly or indirectly supplied the funds for the purchase of the Shares or by the beneficiary of
 such fiduciary account; and the purchaser of Shares has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the Dealer Manager or the Participating Broker-Dealer, as applicable, pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Dealer Manager further
 represents, warrants and covenants, and in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers the Dealer Manager will require such Participating Broker-Dealers to represent, warrant and covenant, that it, or a person associated with it, will make every
 reasonable effort to determine the suitability and appropriateness of an investment in Shares of each proposed investor by reviewing documents and records disclosing the basis upon which the determination as to suitability was reached as to each
 purchaser of Shares pursuant to a subscription solicited by it, whether such documents and records relate to accounts which have been closed, accounts which are currently maintained or accounts hereafter established. The Dealer Manager further
 represents, warrants and covenants, and in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers the Dealer Manager will require such Participating Broker Dealers to represent, warrant and covenant, that it will maintain such records in compliance with
 applicable law and make available a record of the information obtained to determine that an investor meets the suitability standards imposed on the offer or sale of Shares at the time of the initial purchase of Shares to (i) the Company and (ii)
 representatives of the SEC, FINRA and applicable state or non U.S. securities administrators upon the Dealer Manager s receipt of an appropriate document subpoena or other appropriate request for documents from any such agency for a period of at
 least six years following the Termination Date. In addition, at the Company s reasonable written request, which shall be no later than the six (6) year anniversary of the Termination Date, and at the Company s sole expense, the Dealer Manger agrees
 (and in its agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers the Dealer Manager will require such Participating Broker Dealers to agree) to retain such records for a reasonable period of time beyond the six (6) year anniversary of the Termination Date.
 The Dealer Manager shall not purchase any Shares for a discretionary account without obtaining the prior written approval of the Dealer Manager s customer and his or her signature on a Subscription Agreement. The Dealer Manager shall not, and in its
 agreements with Participating Broker-Dealers the Dealer Manager will require such Participating Broker-Dealers not to, purchase any Shares for a discretionary account without obtaining the prior written approval of the Dealer Manager s or
 Participating Broker-Dealer s, as applicable, customer and his or her signature on a Subscription Agreement.

25 

(c) The Dealer Manager agrees, and in its agreements with Participating Broker Dealers the Dealer Manager will require that the
 Participating Broker-Dealers agree, (i) to abide by and comply with (a) the privacy standards and requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 GLB Act and Regulation S-P promulgated thereunder, (b) the privacy standards and
 requirements of any other applicable federal and state law and (c) its own internal privacy policies and procedures, each as may be amended from time to time; (ii) to refrain from the use or disclosure of nonpublic personal information (as defined
 under the GLB Act) of all customers who have opted out of such disclosures except as necessary to service the customers or as otherwise necessary or required by applicable law; and (iii) to determine which customers have opted out of the disclosure
 of nonpublic personal information by periodically reviewing and, if necessary, retrieving a list of such customers (the List as provided by each to identify customers that have exercised their opt-out rights.

In the event the Dealer Manager uses or discloses nonpublic personal information of any customer for purposes other than servicing the customer, or as otherwise required by applicable law, the Dealer
 Manager will consult the List to determine whether the affected customer has exercised his or her opt-out rights. The Dealer Manager understands that it is prohibited from using or disclosing any nonpublic personal information of any customer that is
 identified on the List as having opted out of such disclosures.

26 

17. Severability . If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
 public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, so the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
 any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
 as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

18. No Partnership . Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to constitute the Dealer Manager as an employee, agent or
 representative of, or in association with or in partnership with, the Company; instead, this Agreement shall only constitute the Dealer Manager as a dealer authorized to sell the Shares according to the terms set forth in the Memorandum as amended
 and supplemented and in this Agreement.

19. Notice . Notices and other writings contemplated by this Agreement shall be delivered via (i) hand, (ii) first class registered or certified

SCHEDULE I

SERVICING FEES 

With respect to outstanding Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares and Class D common shares, an ongoing servicing fee
 will be paid monthly in arrears in an amount equal to 0.85 per annum of the aggregate net asset value NAV of the outstanding Class R common shares and Class S common shares, respectively, in an amount equal to 0.50 per annum of the NAV
 of the outstanding Class J-1 common shares and Class J-4 common shares, respectively, and in an amount equal to 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV of the outstanding Class J-2 common shares and Class D common shares, respectively (the Servicing
 Fee ). The Dealer Manager may reallow all or a portion of the Servicing Fee to any Participating Broker-Dealers who sold the Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares
 or Class D common shares giving rise to a portion of such Servicing Fee to the extent the Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement with such Participating Broker-Dealer provides for such a reallowance, and such Participating Broker-Dealer is in
 compliance with the terms of such Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement related to such reallowance; provided, however, that upon the date when the Dealer Manager is notified that the Participating
 Broker-Dealer who sold the Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares or Class D common shares giving rise to a portion of the Servicing Fee is no longer the broker-dealer
 of record with respect to such Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares or Class D common shares or that the Participating Broker-Dealer no longer satisfies any or all of
 the conditions in its Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement for the receipt of the Servicing Fee, then the Participating Broker-Dealer s entitlement to the Servicing Fees related to such Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2
 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares and/or Class D common shares, as applicable, shall cease, and the Participating Broker-Dealer shall not receive the Servicing Fee for any portion of the month in which the Participating
 Broker-Dealer is not eligible on the last day of the month; provided, however, if there is a change in the broker-dealer of record with respect to the Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2
 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares or Class D common shares, as applicable, made in connection with a change in the registration of record for the Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares,
 Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares or Class D common shares on the Company s books and records (including, but not limited to, a reregistration due to a sale or a transfer or a change in the form of ownership of the account), then the
 Participating Broker Dealer shall be entitled to a pro rata portion of the Servicing Fees related to the Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares and/or Class D common
 shares, as applicable, for the portion of the month for which the Participating Broker-Dealer was the broker-dealer of record.

Schedule I - 1 

Thereafter, such Servicing Fees may be reallowed to the then-current broker-dealer of record of the Class R common shares, Class J-1 common shares,
 Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares and/or Class D common shares, as applicable, if any such broker-dealer of record has been designated (the Servicing Dealer ), to the extent such Servicing Dealer has
 entered into a Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement or similar agreement with the Dealer Manager Servicing Agreement ), such Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement or Servicing Agreement with the Servicing Dealer provides for such
 reallowance and the Servicing Dealer is in compliance with the terms of such agreement related to such reallowance. In this regard, all determinations will be made by the Dealer Manager in good faith in its sole discretion. The Dealer Manager is
 not entitled to any Servicing Fee with respect to Class B common shares, Class I common shares and Class E common shares. The Dealer Manager may also reallow some or all of the Servicing Fee to other broker-dealers who provide services with respect
 to the Shares (who shall be considered additional Servicing Dealers) pursuant to a Servicing Agreement with the Dealer Manager to the extent such Servicing Agreement provides for such reallowance and such additional Servicing Dealer is in
 compliance with the terms of such agreement related to such reallowance, in accordance with the terms of such Servicing Agreement. 

To the extent an agreement between the Dealer Manager and a Participating Broker-Dealer or Servicing Dealer limits the transaction or other fees, including Servicing Fees, paid with respect to a
 shareholder, the Dealer Manager shall cease receiving the Servicing Fee with respect to any Class R common share, Class J-1 common share, Class J-2 common share, Class J-4 common share, Class S common share or Class D common share in such
 shareholder s account at the end of the month in which the Dealer Manager, in conjunction with the transfer agent, determines that total Servicing Fees paid with respect to such share would exceed, in the aggregate, the applicable limit, or, such
 Class R common share, Class J-1 common share, Class J-2 common share, Class J-4 common share, Class S common share or Class D common share (and any shares issued under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan with respect thereto) may be
 converted into or exchanged for a number of Class I common shares (including any fractional shares) with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such share. In addition, the Dealer Manager will cease receiving the Servicing Fee on Class R common shares, Class
 J-1 common shares, Class J-2 common shares, Class J-4 common shares, Class S common shares and Class D common shares upon the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I common shares or (ii) the merger or consolidation of the Company
 with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets.
