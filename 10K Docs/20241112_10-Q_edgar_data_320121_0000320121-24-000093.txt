 million of restructuring expenses, which is the total expected costs for this restructuring plan. The actions under this restructuring plan were substantially completed in fiscal year 2023 and were fully paid in the third quarter of 2024. 
 2024 Restructuring Plan 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company undertook another restructuring action in an effort to optimize its strategic priorities and cost structure ("2024 restructuring"). As part of the 2024 restructuring plan, the Company decided to discontinue the development and/or sale of selected solutions or parts of solutions, which resulted in the impairment of capitalized software assets and a reduction in workforce. The restructuring charges under the 2024 restructuring plan include severance and related benefit costs. The Company accrues severance and related benefit costs under the 2024 restructuring plan when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is reasonably estimated. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the cumulative amount of incurred severance and benefit costs related to the 2024 restructuring plan was million. The 2024 restructuring actions are expected to be completed and fully paid during the remainder of fiscal year 2024. 
 In addition, as a result of the Company's decision to abandon the development or sale of selected solutions in the third quarter of 2024, the Company wrote-off million of its previously capitalized software assets. This was reported as an impairment loss on intangible assets under operating expenses on the unaudited consolidated statement of operations.

 and of our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and of our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. All of our business groups earn services revenue under a variety of contract types, including time and materials, firm-fixed price, firm-fixed price level of effort, and cost-plus fixed fee contract types, which may include variable consideration. 
 For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time when each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point. Revenue transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for and of our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and of our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Orders for the sale of software licenses may contain multiple performance obligations, such as maintenance, training, or consulting services, which are typically delivered over time, consistent with the transfer of control disclosed above for the provision of services. When an order contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations based on the standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis. 
 For certain performance obligations where we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services to the customer, do not have inventory risk and have limited discretion in establishing the price for the goods or services, we recognize revenue on a net basis. 
 Our contracts may include various types of variable considerations and may include estimated amounts in the transaction price, based on all of the information available to us, and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We evaluate and include these estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price and as performance on these contracts is complete, we adjust our revenue when deemed necessary. revenue adjustments were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 
 We provide for anticipated losses on contracts during the period when the loss is determined by recording an expense for the total expected costs that exceeds the total estimated revenue for a performance obligation. contract loss was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded an contract loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. contract losses were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Disaggregated Revenues 
 In addition to our segment reporting, as further discussed in Note 16 Segment Information , we disaggregate our revenues by customer and contract types. We treat sales to U.S. customers as sales within the U.S., regardless of where the services are performed. Substantially most of our revenues are generated from U.S. customers, while international customers are de minimis; as such, the financial information by geographic location is not presented.

 The changes in the Company's contract assets and contract liabilities during the current period were primarily the result of the timing differences between the Company's performance, invoicing and customer payments. Revenue recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of each reporting period, was million and million, respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of remaining performance obligations, which we also refer to as funded backlog. We expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, and the balance thereafter.

While we acknowledge the potential material and adverse risk of such a significant concentration of credit risk, our past experience collecting substantially all of such receivables provides us with an informed basis that such risk, if any, is manageable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of all of our customers and generally do not require collateral or other guarantees from our customers. We maintain allowances for potential losses.

 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of December 30, 2025, with the option of issuing letters of credit thereunder with a sub-limit of million, and with an uncommitted expansion feature of up to million of additional revolver capacity (the "Loan"). The Loan is subject to acceleration in the event of customary events of default. The Company has not drawn any amount under the Loan. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest, at our option, at one of variable rates, plus a specified margin. We can elect to borrow at (i) the Alternative Base Rate, plus ; (ii) Adjusted Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus ; and (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR, plus , as such capitalized terms are defined and calculated in the Credit Agreement. The Company may elect to convert borrowings from one type of borrowing to another type per the terms of the Credit Agreement. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, the interest rate may increase by an additional . We are obligated to pay accrued interest (i) with respect to amounts accruing interest based on the Alternative Base Rate, each calendar quarter and on the maturity date, (ii) with respect to amounts accruing interest based on Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, on each one-month anniversary of the borrowing and on the maturity date, and (iii) with respect to amounts accruing interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR, at the end of the period specified per the Credit Agreement and on the maturity date. Upon , , or day's prior notice, as applicable, we may prepay any portion or the entire amount of the Loan. We also paid costs and customary fees, including a closing fee, commitment fees and letter of credit participation fee, if any, payable to the Agent and Lenders, as applicable, in connection with the Loan. 
 The Loan under the Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets, including the Company's pledge of its domestic and material foreign subsidiary equity interests. 
 The Loan has various covenants that may, among other things, affect our ability to create, incur, assume or suffer any indebtedness, merge into or consolidate with another entity, acquire entity interests, sell or transfer certain assets, enter into certain arrangements (such as sale and leaseback and swap agreements) or restrictive agreements, pay dividends and make certain restricted payments, and amend material documents related to any subordinated indebtedness and corporate agreements. The Credit Agreement also requires certain financial covenants to maintain a Senior Leverage Ratio on the last day of any fiscal quarter, no greater than -to-1. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement could result in the Loan and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and allow the Lenders to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Credit Agreement. 
 On April 12, 2023, the Credit Agreement was amended to exclude from collateral the (i) amount collectible from a third party related to an Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement and (ii) receivables generated by the Company from the sale of goods supplied to this third party in an amount not to exceed million. 
 Other Financing Obligations 
 We entered into a Master Purchase Agreement ("MPA") with a third-party buyer ("Buyer") for million relating to software licenses under a specific delivery order ("DO") with our customer, resulting in proceeds from other financing obligations of million in November 2022. Under the MPA, we sold, assigned and transferred all of our rights, title and interest in (i) the DO payments from the customer and (ii) the underlying licenses. The DO covers a base period with an option for the customer to exercise ) additional -month periods through January 2026. The DO payments assigned to the Buyer are billable to the customer at the beginning of the base period and for each option year exercised. The underlying licenses were acquired for resale. 
 On February 9, 2023, the customer notified us that it would not exercise the first option period under the DO. Concurrently, the Company transferred all the rights, title and interest in the underlying licenses in exchange for the extinguishment of the outstanding financing obligations. The Company evaluated the transfer of the underlying licenses as consideration paid for the outstanding financing obligations under ASC 470-10, Debt , and the provisions of the MPA, and concluded that the transaction resulted in an extinguishment of debt. The Company recorded the difference between the carrying value of the Company's debt instrument and the underlying licenses as a gain on early extinguishment of other financing obligations. gain was reported for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a gain of million, which was recorded as "Other income" in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations.

 . PSUs will vest upon the achievement of a defined performance target or market conditions for the Company's common stock or certain operational milestones over a prescribed period. 
 On May 21, 2024, the Company authorized an additional shares to be available under the 2016 LTIP, increasing the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 LTIP to shares. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company granted PSUs that could be settled in up to shares of its common stock to certain senior executives and employees that will vest upon achieving certain operational milestones prior to January 1, 2027. 
 On May 28, 2024, the Company granted PSUs to certain senior executives and employees that could settle in up to shares of its common stock. These PSUs may vest only if the Company achieves certain revenue and Free Cash Flow targets for fiscal year 2025. The Company also granted PSUs containing market conditions to certain executives that could settle in up to shares of its common stock. These PSUs with market conditions may vest, in whole or in part, only if the Company's closing common stock price remains at or above certain specified stock prices for consecutive calendar days prior to January 1, 2027. 
 The Company estimates the fair value for each tranche of the stock-based compensation awards subject to market conditions on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. Monte Carlo approaches are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results. This approach allows the calculation of the value of such PSUs based on a large number of possible stock price path scenarios. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon issues in effect at the time of grant over the performance period. The expense for these awards is recognized over the derived service period as determined through the Monte Carlo simulation model. 
 Our key assumptions include a performance period of years, an expected volatility of , and a risk-free rate of . The fair value for these market condition PSUs at the grant date ranges between - , and the derived service periods ranges between - years. 
 The Company recognizes compensation expense for the performance-based awards with market conditions based on the grant-date fair value calculated using the Monte Carlo model, as described above. Stock-based compensation expense for the performance-based awards is estimated at each reporting date using management's expectation of the probable achievement of the specified performance targets and recognized over the requisite service period for each tranche on a graded-vesting basis. 
 Stock-based compensation expense recognized for restricted stock units and stock options granted to employees and non-employees is included in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations, net of adjustments. There were income tax benefits recognized on the share-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the performance targets for outstanding PSUs granted prior to 2024 were not probable of being achieved. Therefore, the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment for the change in its probability assessment, resulting in a million decrease in stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The performance period for this PSU ended during the third quarter of 2024.

 reportable and operating segments: Security Solutions and Secure Networks. These segments enable the alignment of our strategies and objectives and provide a framework for the timely and rational allocation of resources within the business lines. 
 Our Security Solutions segment is primarily focused on cybersecurity, cloud and identity solutions, and secure messaging through Xacta , Telos Automated Message Handling System ("Telos AMHS ") and Telos ID offerings. We recognize revenue on contracts from providing various system platforms in the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid cloud environments, as well as software sales or software-as-a-service. Revenue associated with the segment's custom solutions is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services and products. Fluctuation in revenue from period to period is the result of the volume of software sales, and the progress or completion of cloud or cybersecurity solutions during the period. The majority of the operating costs relate to labor, material, and overhead costs. Software sales have immaterial operation costs associated with them, thus yielding higher margins. Gross profit and margin are a function of operational efficiency on security solutions and changes in the volume of software sales. 
 Our Secure Networks segment provides secure networking architectures and solutions to our customers through secure mobility solutions, and network management and defense services. Revenue is recognized over time as the work progresses on contracts related to managing network services and information delivery. Contract costs include labor, material, and overhead costs. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in activity levels on individual contracts.

 Business Environment 
 U.S. Budget 
 The fiscal year ("FY") 2024 budget appropriation was approved in March 2024 and has allowed federal departments and agencies to proceed with new program starts and acceleration for the final six months of the fiscal year. With the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act ("FRA"), appropriations bills were marked up in the House and Senate in June and July. The FRA caps total base discretionary spending at 1.6 trillion for FY2024, with base defense spending capped at 886 billion (a three percent increase from FY2023) and base non-defense spending capped at 704 billion (up to a nine percent decrease from FY2023). 
 In March 2024, the U.S. President proposed the annual appropriations for FY2025 to fit within the tight caps set as part of last year's debt ceiling agreements. The Defense Department budget includes 850 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2025, a 34 billion or 4.1 increase from the 2023 enacted level. This growth is in alignment with levels agreed to in the FRA of 2023 and enables the DoD to make the investments necessary to execute the Administration's 2022 National Security Strategy and 2022 National Defense Strategy. 
 The President's FY2025 budget also proposed several increases for key cyber programs and initiatives. For FY2025, the White House had directed agencies to prioritize cyber investments in "secure by design" technologies and the modernization of legacy technology. The budget provides 13 billion in cybersecurity funding across civilian departments and agencies to advance the Administration's commitment to making cyberspace more resilient and defensible. The proposed FY2025 budget includes 3 billion for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ("CISA"), a 103 million increase over the agency's current budget. CISA's 2025 cyber budget proposal also includes 469.8 million for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation ("CDM") program, wherein the agency would use the CDM funding to complete mobile asset deployments, continued asset deployments, initiate Internet of Things ("IoT") activities in asset management, continue to fill gaps in identity and access management capabilities, and align the agency to Zero Trust use cases. In the wake of the President's executive order on artificial intelligence last fall, the 2025 budget proposal includes plenty of AI-related spending, much of which intersects with cybersecurity and AI safety. This includes 470 million to deploy Federal network tools, including endpoint detection and response capabilities; 394 million for CISA's internal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities; 41 million for critical infrastructure security coordination; and 116 million for critical infrastructure cyber event reporting.

 Congress was unable to enact any of its annual appropriation bills before the start of FY2025 on October 1, 2024. Instead, Congress passed and the President has signed into law a Continuing Resolution ("CR") that will extend funding for the federal government until December 20, 2024. The CR provides minimal needed spending adjustments for certain programs to ensure that the federal government can receive adequate funding to operate for the duration of the CR. However, in the current political environment in Congress and with the presidential election in November 2024, it is highly questionable whether Congress and the President will reach an agreement on FY2025 appropriations bills within the duration of the CR. This means the Defense Department and the rest of the federal government will likely be restricted from beginning their planned expenditures in FY2025. 
 Cybersecurity Landscape 
 The scope of cybersecurity is on the edge of transformative changes. Cyber threats are not just escalating in frequency but are also becoming more sophisticated, thus challenging traditional security standards. In this rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, the need for vigilant defense is vital, and cybersecurity is a priority for organizations to mitigate their risk and keep safe from threats and exploitation. Understanding the threat environment and the impending trends (both current and future) is a matter of foresight and is crucial in designing effective security strategies. The Defense Department's budget continues to invest in cybersecurity programs to protect the nation from malicious cyber actors and cyber campaigns. These investments strengthen cyber protection standards for the defense industrial base ("DIB") and cybersecurity of DoD networks. With this growing threat, below are some trends to consider when looking at the cybersecurity landscape: 
 Addresses Emerging Cyber and Counterintelligence Threats: The FY2025 budget expands the Department of Justice s ("DOJ") ability to pursue threats through investments in the FBI s cyber and counterintelligence investigative capabilities. These investments sustain the FBI s cyber intelligence, counterintelligence, and analysis capabilities and include funding to enhance those cyber response and counterintelligence capabilities. The budget also includes funding to expand a new section within the DOJ s National Security Division to focus on cyber threats. These investments align with the National Cybersecurity Strategy that emphasizes a whole-of-nation approach to addressing ongoing cyber threats. Finally, the budget also provides for the DOJ to support the implementation of Executive Order 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. 
 Rising Threats, Rising Liability: Ransomware remains arguably the most severe cyber threat to enterprises in the commercial, state, and local government and education sectors. Phishing is one of the top distribution channels for ransomware. Modern phishing attacks have become adept at bypassing traditional security measures, using more personalized and technically advanced tactics to deceive users. One reason for the rise of ransomware attacks is that it is exceedingly profitable for cybercriminals, and ransomware victims generally settle the ransom rather than restoring the system from backups or dealing with the fallout from a data breach. Aside from the financial costs of paying the ransom and restoring the system, the consequences of a successful ransomware attack can include damage to the organization's reputation, stolen sensitive data being used for malicious purposes, and loss of business. 
 The Nation's Critical Systems Are Still at Risk: Critical infrastructure and industrial IoT are among the categories at greatest risk of cyberattacks. The IoT continues its rapid growth, interconnecting an increasing number of devices. However, this expansion brings with it a host of security challenges. The widespread range of IoT devices make them attractive targets for cyberattacks, and their interrelated nature can lead to pervasive susceptibilities. 
 Navigating a Changing Regulatory Landscape and Compliance: The regulatory landscape governing cybersecurity is developing swiftly. Over time, the government mandates stronger security in highly regulated industries. These government initiatives and audit fatigue continue to burden highly regulated organizations, with automation solutions recognized as the most effective remedy for the many repetitive and redundant tasks that security compliance requires. 
 Additionally, the SEC adopted new rules on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident disclosure by public companies. The required reporting of this information leads many companies to proactively establish policies that will improve their cyber risk management posture and enable them to better withstand heightened public and regulatory scrutiny. 
 Identity Assurance and Privacy Protection are Essential for Today's Enterprises: Identity and access management continue to be a major cybersecurity concern for organizations and individuals that need to ensure their security and protect their privacy. Trusted identities are essential to confidence in IT and physical security strategies and to the success of Zero Trust security models and architectures. The shift to a Zero Trust framework represents a fundamental change in approach in cybersecurity, focusing on identity and access management, continuous monitoring and robust authentication mechanisms to establish a secure digital environment.

Table of Contents 

 Enhancing Identity Security: The shift towards biometric authentication methods is redesigning identity verification in the digital domain. Integrating biometrics with multi-factor authentication can provide a robust defense against unauthorized access. 
 Machine Learning : Artificial Intelligence ("AI") and Machine Learning are set to play a critical role in cybersecurity. Cybercriminals are using AI to launch more sophisticated attacks that can quickly adapt to changing environments, making detection harder. AI's advanced data analysis capabilities are increasingly used for defensive measures over time. To protect against AI-powered cyberattacks, organizations must stay vigilant and adopt advanced cybersecurity tools and techniques that can detect and respond to these threats in a timely manner before they cause damage. The DoD budget provides 455 million to extend the frontiers of AI for science and technology and to increase AI s safety, security, and resilience. These investments enhance the DoD s computing capabilities and support the development of AI testbeds to build foundation models for energy security, national security, and climate resilience as well as tools to evaluate AI capabilities to generate outputs that may represent nuclear, nonproliferation, biological, chemical, critical-infrastructure, and energy security threats or hazards. 
 
 Financial Overview 
 A number of factors have contributed to our third quarter ended September 30, 2024, results of operations, the most significant of which are described below. More details on these changes are presented below within our "Results of Operations" section. 
 The decline in our year-over-year revenue was primarily driven by the successful completion and ramp down of programs in Secure Networks without corresponding new business wins to backfill completed programs. 
 The growth in TSA PreCheck revenue was driven by the increase in our enrollment locations. 
 The reduction in our gross margins was driven by the impact of an impairment loss on intangible assets of 5.3 million and an increase in restructuring expenses of 0.4 million. 
 Higher operating expenses were due to an impairment loss on intangible assets of 6.4 million and higher stock-based compensation expense.

 Operating expenses 
 In the third quarter of 2024, operating expenses increased by 41.0 , compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to increases in impairment loss on intangible assets of 6.0 million, restructuring expenses of 1.1 million, and stock-based compensation expenses of 3.6 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses decreased by 1.7 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expenses of 8.4 million, partially offset by an increase in impairment loss on intangible assets of 6.0 million. 
 Other income 
 The decrease in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same quarter in 2023, was primarily due to the change in dividend income from money market placements. 
 Other income decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the gain on early extinguishment of other financing obligations of 1.4 million in fiscal year 2023, without a similar gain in fiscal year 2024. The remaining variance is attributable to the change in dividend income from money market placements. 
 Segment Results 
 The accounting policies of each business segment are the same as those followed by the Company as a whole. Management evaluates business segment performance based on gross profit.

 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Security Solutions segment revenue decreased by 7.4 , compared to the same quarter in 2023. This was due to the reduction in revenue from a long-term program and the completion of a short-term program in the prior year, partially offset by the growth in TSA PreCheck. Further, Security Solutions segment gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 declined by 75.3 , compared to the same quarter in 2023, and segment gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from 47.3 in 2023 to 12.6 in 2024. The gross margin decline was primarily due to an increase in costs related to the impairment loss on intangible assets and program mix within the portfolio. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Security Solutions segment revenue decreased by 3.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. This was due to the reductions in revenue of two long-term programs and completion of a short-term program in the prior year, partially offset by the growth in TSA PreCheck. In addition, segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 37.6 , compared to the same period in 2023, and segment gross margin declined from 51.4 in 2023 to 33.2 in 2024. The gross margin decline was due to increases in costs related to the impairment loss on intangible assets, higher amortization of software development costs, and program mix within the portfolio.

 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Secure Networks segment revenue decreased by 66.7 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the successful completion and ramp down of programs, without corresponding new business wins to backfill completed programs. Further, segment gross profit decreased by 77.2 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to lower revenue. Gross margin declined from 22.3 in 2023 to 15.3 in 2024, primarily due to restructuring costs and revenue mix within the portfolio. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Secure Networks segment revenue decreased by 43.1 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the successful completion and ramp down of programs without corresponding new business wins to backfill completed programs. Segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 42.0 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower revenue. By contrast, segment gross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, slightly increased from 20.3 in 2023 to 20.7 in 2024, due to program mix and strong program management. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Earnings Per Share ("EPS"), Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cash Gross Profit, Cash Gross Margin and Free Cash Flow are useful in evaluating our operating and cash flow performance. We believe that this non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with our GAAP results, may be helpful to readers of our financial statements because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. 
 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of our operating and cash performance on a consistent basis between periods by excluding certain items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our results of operations in any particular period. When viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, these non-GAAP financial measures help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are supplemental measures of operating and cash flow performance that are not made under GAAP and do not represent, and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income as determined by GAAP. We define EBITDA as net (loss) income, adjusted for non-operating (income) expense, interest expense, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, impairment loss on intangible assets, and restructuring expenses (adjustments). We define EBITDA Margin as EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. 
 We believe that EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide the Board of Directors, management and investors with clear representation of our core operating performance and trends, provide greater visibility into the long-term financial performance of the Company, and eliminate the impact of items that do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of the business. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Board of Directors and management to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to evaluate the performance of certain management personnel when determining incentive compensation.

No stock-based compensation from other sources was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while 3.8 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The other sources of stock-based compensation consist of accrued compensation, which the Company intends to settle in shares of the Company's common stock. However, it is the Company s discretion whether this compensation will ultimately be paid in stock or cash. The Company has the right to dictate the form of these payments up until the date at which they are paid. Any change to the expected payment form would result in out of quarter adjustments to this add back to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 (2) The restructuring expenses include severance and other related benefit costs (including outplacement services and continuing health insurance coverage), external consulting and advisory fees related to implementing the restructuring plan. 
 (3) Due to its immaterial amount, the impairment loss on intangible assets of 0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was reported as part of depreciation and amortization expenses in 2023. 
 Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS 
 Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are supplemental measures of operating and cash flow performance that are not made under GAAP and do not represent, and should not be considered as an alternatives to net (loss) income and earnings per share as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted Net Loss as net (loss) income, adjusted for non-operating (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, impairment loss on intangible assets, and restructuring expenses (adjustments). We define Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Loss divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
 Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS provide the Board of Directors, management and investors with clear representation of our core operating performance and trends, provide greater visibility into the long-term financial performance of the Company, and eliminate the impact of items that do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of the business.

 Adjusted Gross Profit, Cash Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Cash Gross Margin 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Cash Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Cash Gross Margin are supplemental measures of operating and cash flow performance that are not made under GAAP and do not represent, and should not be considered as an alternatives to gross profit and gross margin as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit, plus stock-based compensation expense, impairment loss on intangible assets, restructuring expenses, as well as non-recurring items charged under cost of sales. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of total revenue. We define Cash Gross Profit as Adjusted Gross Profit, plus depreciation and amortization. We define Cash Gross Margin as Cash Gross Profit as a percentage of total revenue. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Cash Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Cash Gross Margin provide management and investors a clear representation of the core economics of gross profit and gross margin without the impact of non-cash expenses and sunk costs expended.

 Free Cash Flow 
 Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of operating and cash flow performance that are not made under GAAP and do not represent, and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, as determined by GAAP. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities, less net purchases of property and equipment, and capitalized software development costs. 
 We use Free Cash Flow to understand the cash flows that directly correspond with our operations and the investments we must make in those operations, using a methodology that combines operating cash flows and capital expenditures. Further, Free Cash Flow may be useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company's operating and cash flow performance and liquidity, and to evaluate the performance of certain management personnel when determining incentive compensation. 
 Table MD A 7: Reconciliation of Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (7,080) 846 (15,420) (3,367) Adjustments: Purchases of property and equipment, net (49) (80) (381) (350) Capitalized software development costs (2,789) (3,762) (9,104) (11,960) Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) (9,918) (2,996) (24,905) (15,677) 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cash Gross Profit, Cash Gross Margin and Free Cash Flow each has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Among other limitations, each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cash Gross Profit, Cash Gross Margin and Free Cash Flow does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, does not reflect the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, and does not reflect income tax expense or benefit. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cash Gross Profit, Cash Gross Margin and Free Cash Flow differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Cash Gross Profit, Cash Gross Margin nor Free Cash Flow should be considered as a replacement for gross profit, gross margin, net (loss) income, earnings per share or net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, future operating cash flows, and, if needed, borrowings under our 30.0 million revolving credit facility, with an available expansion feature of up to 30.0 million of additional revolver facility. While a variety of factors related to sources and uses of cash, such as timeliness of accounts receivable collections, vendor credit terms, or significant collateral requirements, ultimately impact our liquidity, such factors may or may not have a direct impact on our liquidity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 69.8 million and our working capital was 72.0 million. 
 We place a strong emphasis on liquidity management. This focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. We believe we have adequate funds on hand to execute our financial and operating strategy. Our overall financial position and liquidity are strong. Although no assurances can be given, we believe the available cash balances and access to our revolving credit facility are sufficient to maintain the liquidity we require to meet our operating, investing and financing needs for the next 12 months. 
 Cash Flow 
 Table MD A 8: Net Change in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (15,420) (3,367) Net cash used in investing activities (12,485) (12,310) Net cash used in financing activities (1,591) (3,673) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (29,496) (19,350) 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 15.4 million, an increase of 12.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. The change is primarily driven by the Company's operating losses, the timing of receipts of customer payments, the timing of payments to vendors and employees, and the timing of inventory turnover, adjusted for certain non-cash items that do not impact cash flows from operating activities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, slightly increased by 0.2 million, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the cash outflow from the purchase of an investment of 3.0 million in 2024, with no similar transaction in 2023. This is partially offset by a decrease of 2.8 million in capital expenditures in 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 2.1 million, compared to the same period in 2023. This is primarily attributable to the decreases in payment of tax withholding related to net share settlement of equity awards of 0.5 million in the first half of 2024, compared with 1.7 million in the same period of 2023, and a 0.6 million payment for the Diamond Fortress Technologies ("DFT") holdback in February 2023, with no similar payment in 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, includes a summary of critical accounting policies we believe are the most important to aid in understanding our financial results. There have been no changes to those critical accounting policies that have had a material impact on our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, including this Report, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer ("CEO") and principal financial officer ("CFO") as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company's management, including the Company's CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
