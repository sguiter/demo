CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund 
Notes to the Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
September 30, 2024 

The Trust utilizes an exchange traded price from the
principal market for bitcoin as of 4:00 p.m. ET on the Trust s financial statement measurement date to value the bitcoin held by
the Trust. The Sponsor determines in its sole discretion the valuation sources and policies used to prepare the Trust s financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Trust engages a third-party vendor to obtain a price from a principal market for bitcoin,
which is determined and designated by such third-party vendor daily based on its consideration of several exchange characteristics, including
the volume and frequency of trades. 

Total Investments 

There were no transfers
between Level 1 and other Levels for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

A financial instrument s level within the fair
value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The availability of observable
inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of security,
whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular
to the security. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the
determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest
for instruments categorized in Level 3. 

The Trust fair values investments for financial statement
purposes, categorizing those investments using the hierarchy as described above. 

The fair value of bitcoin held by the Trust is determined
based on a GAAP-consistent pricing source. The Trust s NAV is calculated by subtracting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities
from the fair value of its bitcoin and other assets. The Trust s NAV per share is calculated by taking the Trust s NAV divided
by the total amount of Shares outstanding. 

to the Trust s bitcoin holdings. The Sponsor Fee will be payable in bitcoins at such times as determined in the
Sponsor s sole discretion. The Trust is not responsible for paying any fees or costs associated with the transfer of bitcoin to
the Sponsor or the sale of bitcoin for costs not included in the Sponsor Fee. 

The Sponsor is obligated
to assume and pay the following fees and expenses of the Trust: the Marketing Agent fee, the Administrator fee, the Custodian fee, the
Cash Custodian fee, the Transfer Agent fee, the Trustee fee, applicable license fees, including the licensing fees related to the Index
License Agreement, fees and expenses related to trading of Shares on Nasdaq (including marketing, legal and audit fees and expenses),
legal expenses, audit fees, regulatory fees, including any fees relating to the registration of the Shares with the SEC, printing and
mailing costs and costs of maintaining the Trust s website.

required to reimburse the Trust or the Sponsor, as applicable, for any operational processing and brokerage costs, transfers fees, network
fees, stamp taxes and part or all of the spread between the expected bid and offer side of the market related to the bitcoin being purchased
or sold in connection with such order (the Execution Charges , and collectively with the Transfer Agent Fee, the Transaction

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to, our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ). 

This Quarterly Report contains
 forward-looking statements with respect to the Trust s financial conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives,
future performance and business. Statements preceded by, followed by or that include words such as may, might, 
 will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, 
 predict, potential or continue, the negative of these terms and other similar expressions are
intended to identify some of the forward-looking statements. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this
Quarterly Report that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as changes
in market prices and conditions (for bitcoin and the Shares), the Trust s operations, the Sponsor s plans and references to
the Trust s future success and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual
events or results may differ materially. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor made based on its
perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances.
Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties, including: 

the special considerations discussed in this Quarterly Report; 

general economic, market and business conditions; 

the use of technology by us and our vendors, including the Custodians, in conducting our business, including
disruptions in our computer systems and data centers and our transition to, and quality of, new technology platforms; 

changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or
regulatory bodies; 

the costs and effects of any litigation or regulatory investigations; 

our ability to maintain a positive reputation; and 

other world economic and political developments. 

Consequently, all the forward-looking
statements made in this Quarterly Report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results
or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences
to, or have the expected effects on, the Trust s operations or the value of the Shares. Should one or more of these risks discussed
in the Quarterly Report or other uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary
materially from those described in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on the Sponsor s beliefs,
estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty or undertakes an obligation
to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, other than as required
by applicable laws. Moreover, neither the Trust, the Sponsor, nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness
of any of these forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. 

Overview of the Trust 

CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund,
formerly Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (the Trust ), is a Delaware statutory trust formed on January 20, 2021. The Trust issues common
units of beneficial interest Shares ), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership
of the Trust. The Shares of the Trust are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq or the Exchange ).
On June 14, 2024, CoinShares Co., a Delaware corporation (the Sponsor ), succeeded Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the Initial Sponsor ), as the sponsor of the Trust. As of September 30, 2024, CoinShares Co. is
the sponsor of the Trust, and Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee ). The operations of the Trust
are governed by the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust, among the Trustee, the Sponsor, and the shareholders from time
to time thereunder (the Shareholders ), as may be amended from time to time (the Trust Agreement ). The Trust
is an exchange-traded product. When the Trust sells or redeems its Shares, it will do so in blocks of 5,000 Shares (a Basket based on the quantity of bitcoin attributable to each Share of the Trust (net of accrued but unpaid expenses and liabilities). Only
registered broker-dealers that have previously entered into an agreement with the Sponsor governing the terms and conditions of such issuance
(such broker-dealers, the Authorized Participants ), can place orders to receive Baskets in exchange for cash. Baskets may
be redeemed by the Trust in exchange for the cash proceeds from selling the amount of bitcoin corresponding to their redemption value.

Trust may also be found on the SEC s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 

Investment Objectives and Principal Investment Strategies 

Investment Objectives 

The investment objective of the
Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a bitcoin as represented by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate 
New York Variant (the Index ), less the Trust s liabilities and expenses. 

Principal Investment Strategies 

In seeking to achieve its investment
objective, the Trust holds bitcoin and values its Shares daily based on the value of bitcoin as reflected by the Index, which is an independently
calculated value based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges. The Index currently uses substantially
the same methodology as the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate BRR ), including utilizing the same bitcoin exchanges, which is
the underlying rate to determine settlement of CME bitcoin futures contracts, except that the Index is calculated as of 4:00 p.m. ET,
whereas the BRR is calculated as of 4:00 p.m. London time. There can be no assurance that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.
The Sponsor is authorized under the Trust Agreement to substitute an alternative index, reference rate, or other methodology for valuing
bitcoin for the Index for purposes of the Trust s investment objective and valuation policies at its sole discretion and without
Shareholder approval. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin. 

Valuation of Bitcoin; Use of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate 
New York Variant 

On each day other than a Saturday
or a Sunday, or a day on which Nasdaq is closed for regular trading (a Business Day ), as soon as practicable after 4:00
p.m. ET, the Trust evaluates the bitcoin held by the Trust as reflected by the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate New York Variant
for the Bitcoin U.S. Dollar trading pair (the CF Benchmarks Index and determines the net asset value of the Trust
and the net asset value per Share NAV ). 

CF Benchmarks Index is calculated
as of 4:00 p.m. ET. The CF Benchmarks Index is designed based on the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks and is a Registered Benchmark
under UK Benchmark Regulations BMR ). The administrator of the CF Benchmarks Index is CF Benchmarks Ltd. (the Index
Administrator a UK incorporated company, authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA of the
UK as a Benchmark Administrator, under UK BMR. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 

The Trust s net asset value
increased from 518,313,439 at June 30, 2024, to 569,655,239 at September 30, 2024. The change in the Trust s net assets resulted
from an increase in outstanding Shares, which grew from 29,545,000 at June 30, 2024, to 31,720,000 at September 30, 2024, as a result
of 2,730,000 Shares (546 Baskets) being created and 555,000 Shares (111 Baskets) being redeemed during the quarter, and an increase
in the value of bitcoin, which appreciated 2.4 from 61,910 at June 30, 2024, to 63,418 at September 30, 2024. 

The net asset value per Share
increased 2.4 from 17.54 at June 30, 2024 to 17.96 at September 30, 2024. 

The net asset value per Share
of 19.22 at July 22, 2024 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low of 15.05 at August 5, 2024. 

The increase in net assets from
operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 12,632,292, resulting from an increase in unrealized gain on the Trust s
bitcoin investment of 10,981,879, realized gains on the disposition of bitcoin of 1,994,668, and Sponsor Fees incurred of 344,255. 

12 

Cash Resources and Liquidity 

The Trust does not hold a cash
balance except in connection with the creation and redemption of Baskets or to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. To the extent
the Trust does not have available cash to facilitate redemptions or pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, the Trust will sell bitcoin.
When selling bitcoin on behalf of the Trust, the Sponsor endeavors to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than bitcoin.
As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will have an immaterial amount of cash flow from its operations and that its cash
balance will be insignificant at the end of each reporting period. The Trust s only sources of cash are proceeds from the sale of
Baskets and bitcoin. The Trust will not borrow to meet liquidity needs. 

In exchange for the Sponsor Fee,
the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. The Sponsor Fee accrues at an annual rate of 0.25 of the
Trust s Bitcoin Holdings. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust is the Sponsor Fee. The Trust is not aware of any
trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

The Trust has not used, nor does
it expect to use in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements and have no loan guarantee
arrangements or off balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which
may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services for the Trust. While
the Trust s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not
expected to have a material impact on a Trust s financial position. 

Sponsor Fee payments made to the
Sponsor are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Trust s Bitcoin Holdings. As such, the Sponsor cannot anticipate the payment
amounts that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as the Trust s net assets are not known until a future
date. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Principal Market and Fair Value Determination 

The Trust s
periodic financial statements may not utilize the net asset value of the Trust determined by reference to the Index to the extent the
methodology used to calculate the Index is deemed not to be consistent with GAAP. The Trust s periodic financial statements will
be prepared in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Topic 820 and utilize an exchange-traded price from the Trust s
principal market for bitcoin on the Trust s financial statement measurement date. The Sponsor will determine at its sole discretion
the valuation sources and policies used to prepare the Trust s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Trust intends to
engage a third-party vendor to obtain a price from a principal market for bitcoin, which will be determined and designated by such third-party
vendor daily based on its consideration of several exchange characteristics, including oversight, and the volume and frequency of trades.
Under GAAP, such a price is expected to be deemed a Level 1 input in accordance with the ASC Topic 820 because it is expected to be a
quoted price in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

To determine which
market is the Trust s principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating
the Trust s financial statements, the Trust follows ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10
determines fair value to be the price that would be received for bitcoin in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that bitcoin is sold in its principal market to market
participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers
in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. The Trust may transact
through digital asset brokers or dealers, in multiple markets, and its application of ASC 820-10 reflects this fact. The Trust anticipates
that, while multiple venues and types of markets will be available to the digital asset brokers or dealers from whom the Sponsor acquires
or disposes of the Trust s bitcoin, the principal market in each scenario is determined by looking at the market-based level of
volume and bitcoin trading activity. Digital asset brokers or dealers may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal
Markets and Exchange Markets (each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary). Based on information reasonably available to the Trust,
Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Exchange Markets
as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of
the aforementioned analysis, an Exchange Market has been selected as the Trust s principal market. The Trust determines its principal
market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) on a quarterly basis to determine which market is its Principal
Market for the purpose of calculating fair value for the creation of quarterly and annual financial statements. 

13 

The process that
the Sponsor has developed for identifying a principal market, as prescribed in ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value
accounting. The process begins by identifying publicly available, well-established and reputable bitcoin trading venues (Exchange Markets,
as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary), which are selected by the Sponsor and its affiliates at their sole discretion. Those markets
include Binance, Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit, Kraken, Gemini, and LMAX. The Sponsor then, through a service provider, calculates on
each valuation period, the highest volume venue during the 60-minute period prior to 4:00 ET for bitcoin. The Sponsor then identifies
that market as the principal market for bitcoin during that period and uses the price for bitcoin from that venue at 4:00 ET as the principal
market price. 

Investment Company Considerations 

The Trust is an
investment company for GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial
Services Investment Companies. The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for Bitcoin in accordance with its classification
as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying

The Trust maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its 1934 Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation,
the Principal Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by
