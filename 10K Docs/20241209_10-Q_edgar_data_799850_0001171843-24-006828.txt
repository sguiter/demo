million (see Note F). As of October 31, 2024, the Company had million in outstanding borrowings under its revolving line of credit. The loan and security agreement, as amended, requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants computed on a monthly basis. The Company is currently in compliance with such financial covenants. Given this maturity of the line of credit combined with the Company s decline in operations, such as negative cash flows from operations and a negative working capital position, the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next 12 months if the line of credit is not extended. The Company plans to continue raising capital through the non-recourse securitization market, which represents the majority of its funding. During the past two fiscal years the Company has issued five series of asset-backed non-recourse securities, and the Company currently expects to issue additional series of asset-backed non-recourse securities during the fiscal year. 

Though substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern has been raised due to the upcoming maturity of the revolving credit facility, the Company maintains strong banking relationships. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company entered into its first warehouse agreement and executed the 7th amendment on the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement. The 8th Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement was executed in the second quarter of this fiscal year. The Company has initiated discussions with the lending group to begin the process for the extension of the revolver. The commencement of these discussions, along with the recently executed agreements and amendments, demonstrate the Company s strong banking relationship and indicate that refinancing before maturity is probable of being implemented. 

Management believes the ability to issue the asset backed non-recourse securities is sufficient to allow the Company to meet its obligations as they become due for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. Additionally, management believes that the implementation of the refinancing of the revolving line of credit will strengthen the Company s financial position. Management believes that the plans are probable and have alleviated the substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

million for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and wholesales sales of million for the six months ended October 31, 2023 in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. APP reserves of million were reclassed out of accrued liabilities to reserve against finance receivables and million of estimated APP insurance receivables were reclassed out of finance receivables to prepaid expenses and other assets for the three months ended July 31, 2023. million and million of wholesales sales were reclassed out of wholesales third party sales to cost of goods sold for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and October 31, 2023, respectively. The reclassification had no effect on the prior year net income or shareholder s equity.

of current period revenues resulting from sales to Arkansas customers. 

As of October 31, 2024, and periodically throughout the period, the Company maintained cash in financial institutions in excess of the amounts insured by the federal government. The cash is held in several highly rated banking institutions. The Company regularly monitors its counterparty credit risk and mitigates exposure by limiting the amount it invests in one institution.

million through an amortizing warehouse loan facility collateralized by certain additional auto finance receivables originated by the Company s operating subsidiaries. Under the loan and security agreement, the warehouse lender had recourse against the Company for up to of the aggregate amount borrowed under the facility. The Company paid off the warehouse facility in October 2024. No debt was outstanding under the warehouse loan facility as of October 31, 2024. See Notes C and F for additional information on auto finance receivables, non-recourse notes payable and warehouse loan facility. 

The Company carries the debt from the term securitization trusts on its balance sheet in recognition of the Company s residual economic interest in the receivable pools for each transaction. The Company or one of its subsidiaries serves as the servicer for each securitization, managing collection activities in the same manner as it does with its overall portfolio of receivables. The overcollateralization in each financing serves to absorb credit losses (subject to limitations) and the Company receives remaining assets of the trust upon repayment in full of the related indebtedness. 

using the simple effective interest method including any deferred fees. During the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, the Company increased the interest rate on new originations of installment sale contracts to (from in all states except Arkansas (which originate at ), Illinois (which originate at - and acquired dealerships in Tennessee (which originate at up to ). Contract origination costs are not significant. The installment sale contracts are structured to have variable payments whereby borrowers are obligated to pay back principal plus the full amount of interest that will accrue over the entire term of the contract. Finance receivables are collateralized by vehicles sold and consist of contractually scheduled payments from installment contracts net of unearned finance charges and an allowance for credit losses. Unearned finance charges to be collected represent the balance of interest receivable to be earned over the remaining term of the related installment contract, and as such, have been reflected as a reduction to the gross contract amount in arriving at the principal balance in finance receivables . Total earned finance charges were million and million at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

An account is considered delinquent when the customer is one day or more behind on their contractual payments. While the Company does not formally place contracts on nonaccrual status, the immaterial amount of interest that may accrue after an account becomes delinquent up until the point of resolution via repossession or write-off is reserved for against the accrued interest on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Delinquent contracts are addressed and either made current by the customer, which is the case in most situations, or the vehicle is repossessed or written off if the collateral cannot be recovered quickly. Customer payments are set to match their payday, with approximately of payments due on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The frequency of the payment due dates combined with the declining value of collateral lead to prompt resolutions on problem accounts. On October 31, 2024, of the Company s finance receivable balances were 30 days or more past due, compared to at April 30, 2024. 

Substantially all of the Company s installment sale contracts involve contracts made to individuals with impaired or limited credit histories, or higher debt-to-income ratios than permitted by traditional lenders. Contracts made with buyers who are restricted in their ability to obtain financing from traditional lenders generally entail a higher risk of delinquency, default and repossession, and higher losses than contracts made with buyers with better credit. At the time of originating an installment sale contract, the Company requires customers to meet certain criteria that demonstrate their intent and ability to pay for the financed principal and interest on the vehicle they are purchasing. However, the Company recognizes that their customer base is at a higher risk of default given their impaired or limited credit histories. 

The Company strives to keep its delinquency percentages low, and not to repossess vehicles. Accounts one to three days late are contacted by telephone or text messaging notifications. Notes from each contact are electronically maintained in the Company s computer system. The Company also utilizes text messaging notifications that allow customers the option to receive due date reminders and late notifications, if applicable. The Company attempts to resolve payment delinquencies amicably prior to repossessing a vehicle. If a customer becomes severely delinquent in his or her payments, and management determines that timely collection of future payments is not probable, the Company will take steps to repossess the vehicle. 

Periodically, the Company enters into contract modifications with its customers to extend or modify the payment terms. The Company only enters into a contract modification or extension if it believes such action will increase the amount of money the Company will ultimately realize on the customer s account and will increase the likelihood of the customer being able to pay off the installment sale contract. At the time of modification, the Company expects to collect amounts due including accrued interest at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. No other concessions are granted to customers, beyond the extension of additional time, at the time of modifications. Modifications are minor and are made for payday changes, minor vehicle repairs and other reasons. For those vehicles that are repossessed, the majority are returned or surrendered by the customer on a voluntary basis. Other repossessions are performed by Company personnel or third-party repossession agents. Depending on the condition of a repossessed vehicle, it is either resold on a retail basis through a Company dealership or sold for cash on a wholesale basis, primarily through physical or online auctions. 

The Company takes steps to repossess a vehicle when the customer becomes delinquent in his or her payments and management determines that timely collection of future payments is not probable. Accounts are charged-off after the expiration of a statutory notice period for repossessed accounts, or when management determines that the timely collection of future payments is not probable for accounts where the Company has been unable to repossess the vehicle. For accounts with respect to which the vehicle was repossessed, the fair value of the repossessed vehicle is charged as a reduction of the gross finance receivables balance charged-off. On average, accounts are approximately days past due at the time of charge-off. For previously charged-off accounts that are subsequently recovered, the amount of such recovery is credited to the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the net repossession and charge-off loss is also reduced by any deferred service contract and accident protection plan revenue at the time of charge-off. 

The quantitative portion of the Company s allowance for credit losses is measured using an undiscounted cash flow CF model whereby the undiscounted cash flows are adjusted by a prepayment rate and then the loss rate is applied and compared to the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to reflect management s estimate of expected credit losses. The CF model is based on installment sale contract level characteristics of the Company s finance receivables, such as the contractual payment structure, maturity date, payment frequency for recurring payments, and interest rates, as well as the following assumptions: 

a historical loss period, which represents a full economic credit cycle utilizing loss experience, to calculate the historical loss rate; and 

static annualized historical rate based on average time of charge-off; and 

expected prepayment rates based on our historical experience, which also incorporates non-standard contractual payments such as down payments made during the first ninety-days or annual seasonal payments. 

The Company s allowance for credit losses also considers qualitative factors not captured within the CF modeled results such as changes in underwriting and collection practices, economic trends, changes in volume and terms of installment sales contracts, credit quality trends, installment sale contract review results, collateral trends, and concentrations of credit. The Company s qualitative factors incorporate a macroeconomic variable forecast of inflation over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year that affects its customers non-discretionary income and ability to repay. The reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year is based on management s current review of the reliability of extended forecasts and is applied as an adjustment to the historical loss rate. 

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at an amount it considers sufficient to cover net credit losses expected over the remaining life of the installment sales contracts in the portfolio at the measurement date. At October 31, 2024, the weighted average total contract term was months, with months remaining. The allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2024, million, was of the principal balance in finance receivables of billion, less deferred APP revenue of million and deferred service contract revenue of million, less pending APP claims of million. The allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations. 

In most states, the Company offers retail customers who finance their vehicle the option of purchasing an accident protection plan product as an add-on to the installment sale contract. This product contractually obligates the Company to cancel the remaining principal outstanding for any contract where the retail customer s vehicle is totaled, as defined by the product, or the vehicle has been stolen. The Company periodically evaluates anticipated losses to ensure that if anticipated losses exceed deferred accident protection plan revenues, an additional liability is recorded for such difference. At October 31, 2024, anticipated losses did not exceed deferred accident protection plan revenues. 

due to the closure of an acquired dealership location in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The Company also recorded an million increase to goodwill due to the acquisition of Texas Auto Center in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. 

Goodwill totaled million at October 31, 2024 and million at April 30, 2024.

million and million as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized implementation costs for these arrangements was million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and for the same period in the prior year. 

and for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively. Total income tax expense for the six months ended October 31, 2024 differed from amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income primarily due to state income taxes and the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income. The Company did not record a discrete income tax benefit for the six months ended October 31, 2024 related to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. The Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of approximately for the six months ended October 31, 2023. 

Occasionally, the Company is audited by taxing authorities. These audits could result in proposed assessments of additional taxes. The Company believes that its tax positions comply in all material respects with applicable tax law. However, tax law is subject to interpretation, and interpretations by taxing authorities could be different from those of the Company, which could result in the imposition of additional taxes. 

The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company applies this methodology to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open. 

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before fiscal . 

The Company s policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of October 31, 2024 or April 30, 2024. 

miles. Service contract revenues are included in sales and the related expenses are included in cost of sales. Accident protection plan revenues are initially deferred and then recognized to income using the Rule of 78 s interest method over the life of the contract so that revenues are recognized in proportion to the amount of cancellation protection provided. Accident protection plan revenues are included in sales and related losses are included in cost of sales as incurred. Any unearned revenue from ancillary products is charged-off at the time of repossession. Interest income is recognized on all active finance receivables accounts using the simple effective interest method. Active accounts include all accounts except those that have been paid-off or charged-off. 

Sales for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following:

At October 31, 2024 and 2023, finance receivables more than 90 days past due were approximately million and million, respectively. Late fee revenues totaled approximately million and million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, respectively. Late fee revenues totaled approximately million and million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Late fees are recognized when collected and are reflected in interest and other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which sets forth improvements to the current segment disclosure requirements in accordance with Topic 280 Segment Reporting, including clarifying that entities with a single reportable segment are subject to both new and existing segment reporting requirements. ASU 2023-07 will be effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU will result in additional disclosure, but will not impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (ASU 2023-09) related to income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning May 1, 2025, and we do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

for all states except Arkansas (which originate at ), Illinois (which originate at - and acquired dealerships in Tennessee (which originate at up to ), are collateralized by the vehicle sold and typically provide for payments over periods ranging from to months. The Company s finance receivables are defined as one segment and one class of contracts, which is sub-prime consumer automobile contracts. The level of risks in the Company s finance receivables is managed as one homogeneous pool. 

The components of finance receivables are as follows: 

Less unearned finance charges

Less: estimated insurance receivables for APP claims 

Less: allowance for APP claims 

Less allowance for credit losses 

Finance receivables, net 

Loan origination costs

Amounts recovered from previously written-off accounts were approximately million and million for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are netted against recovered collateral in the table above. 

The Company reduced the allowance for credit loss in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 to from at July 31, 2024, resulting in a decrease of million to the provision. The primary driver of this change was favorable performance in loans originated under the loan origination system and the improvements the new system is driving in the Company s historical loss rates. 

The following table presents the finance receivables that are current and past due as follows:

Accounts one and two days past due are considered current for this analysis, due to the varying payment dates and variation in the day of the week at each period end. Delinquencies may vary from period to period based on the average age of the portfolio, seasonality within the calendar year, the day of the week and overall economic factors. The above categories are consistent with internal operational measures used by the Company to monitor credit results. 

Substantially all of the Company s installment sale contracts involve contracts made to individuals with impaired or limited credit histories, or higher debt-to-income ratios than permitted by traditional lenders. Contracts made with buyers who are restricted in their ability to obtain financing from traditional lenders generally entail a higher risk of delinquency, default and repossession, and higher losses than contracts made with buyers with better credit. The Company monitors customer scores, contract term length, payment to income, down payment percentages, and collections for credit quality indicators.

Average originating contract term (in months 

Total dollars collected per active customer for the six months ended October 31, 2024 increased year over year and principal collections as a percentage of average finance receivables increased slightly by basis points compared to the prior year. The average originating contract term was close to flat compared to prior year. The portfolio weighted average contract term increased primarily due to the increased average selling price for the six months ended October 31, 2024, up or , from the prior year period. 

When customers apply for financing, the Company s proprietary scoring model relies on the customers credit histories and certain application information to evaluate and rank their risk. The Company obtains credit histories and other credit data that includes information such as number of different addresses, age of oldest record, high risk credit activity, job time, time at residence and other factors. The application information that is used includes income, collateral value and down payment. The scoring models yield credit grades that represent the relative likelihood of repayment. Customers with the highest probability of repayment are 6 rated customers. Customers assigned a lower grade are determined to have a lower probability of repayment. For installment sales contracts that are approved, the credit grade influences the terms of the agreement, such as the maximum amount financed, term length and minimum down payment. After origination, credit grades are generally not updated.

Revolving Line of Credit 

On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 8 to its revolving credit facility agreement (the Amendment ), which, among other things, reduced the total permitted borrowings from million to million and requires the Company to maintain a minimum amount available to be drawn under the credit facilities of million. If the outstanding principal balance under the line of credit equals or exceeds 300 million, the Company will be required to maintain a minimum availability of million. The Amendment also made certain modifications to the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and restricts the Company from making future repurchases of its common stock, along with the agreement s existing restrictions on other distributions to the Company s shareholders. In addition, the Amendment adds Colonial Underwriting, Inc., an Arkansas corporation, as a new guarantor. 

At October 31, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries have million of permitted borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The revolving credit facilities are collateralized by finance receivables and inventory, are cross collateralized and contain a guarantee by the Company. Interest is payable monthly under the revolving credit facilities with a scheduled maturity date of September 30, 2025. The current applicable interest rate under the credit facilities is SOFR plus or for non-SOFR amounts the base rate of plus at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. The credit facilities contain various reporting and performance covenants including (i) maintenance of certain financial ratios and tests, (ii) limitations on borrowings from other sources, (iii) restrictions on certain operating activities and (iv) restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions (see Note B). 

The Company was in compliance with the covenants at October 31, 2024. The amount available to be drawn under the credit facilities is a function of eligible finance receivables and inventory. Based upon eligible finance receivables and inventory at October 31, 2024, the Company had additional availability of approximately million under the revolving credit facilities. 

Under the existing terms of the loan and security agreement, as amended, for the revolving credit facility, the facility is scheduled to mature in September 2025. However, discussions are in process for the extension of the revolver, and the Company expects that it will reach agreement on an extension of the credit facility prior to its maturity. 

Non-Recourse and Recourse Notes Payable 

The Company has issued five separate series of asset-backed non-recourse notes (known as the 2022 Issuance , 2023-1 Issuance , 2023-2 Issuance , 2024-1 Issuance and 2024-2 Issuance ). All five issuances are collateralized by installment sale contracts directly originated by the Company. Credit enhancement for the non-recourse notes payable consists of overcollateralization, a reserve account funded with an initial amount of not less than of the pool balance, excess interest on the auto finance receivables, and in some cases, the subordination of certain payments to noteholders of less senior classes of notes. The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the related auto finance receivables. In December 2023, the Company fully paid off the 2022 Issuance. The debt related to the remaining term securitization transactions accrues interest at fixed rates and has scheduled maturities through January 22, 2030, June 20, 2030, January 21, 2031, and August 20, 2031, respectively, but may be repaid earlier, depending upon collections from the underlying auto finance receivables. The original principal balance and weighted average fixed coupon rate for the four securitizations are as follows:

2024-1 

2024-2 

On July 12, 2024, the Company s principal operating subsidiary, America s Car Mart, Inc., and a newly formed affiliate entered into a loan and security agreement under which the Company s affiliate borrowed million in funding through an amortizing warehouse loan facility collateralized by installment sale contracts directly originated by the Company s operating subsidiaries. The Company used the funding from the warehouse loan facility to pay down outstanding amounts borrowed under the Company s revolving line of credit to fund its finance receivables. The loan and security agreement provided for additional borrowing availability, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement, and recourse against the Company with respect to up to of the aggregate amount borrowed under the warehouse facility payable. Interest on any outstanding balances accrues at a rate of SOFR plus basis points, with a scheduled maturity date of July 12, 2026. In October 2024, the Company used the proceeds from its 2024-2 Issuance to pay down the outstanding balance under the warehouse loan facility. No debt was outstanding under the warehouse loan facility as of October 31, 2024. 

Level 2 Inputs Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

Because no market exists for certain of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments and estimates regarding yield expectations of investors, credit risk and other risk characteristics, including interest rate and prepayment risk. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. 

The methodology and assumptions utilized to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments and other assets are as follows: 

Financial Instrument and Other Assets 

Valuation Methodology 

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 

The carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the short-term nature of the financial instruments (Level 1). 

Repossessed inventory 

The fair value approximates wholesale value (Level 1). 

Finance receivables, net 

The Company estimated the fair value of its receivables at what a third-party purchaser might be willing to pay. The Company has had discussions with third parties and has bought and sold portfolios and has had a third-party appraisal in October 2022 that indicates a range of to discount to face would be a reasonable fair value in a negotiated third-party transaction. The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial is made at a discount. For financial reporting purposes these sale transactions are eliminated (Level 2). 

Accounts payable 

The carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the short-term nature of the financial instrument (Level 2). 

Contingent consideration payable for acquisition 

The fair value is based upon inputs from the earn-out projection for the applicable acquisition (Level 2). 

Revolving line of credit 

The fair value approximates carrying value due to the variable interest rates charged on the borrowings, which reprice frequently (Level 2). 

Notes payable 

The fair value is based upon inputs derived from prices for similar instruments at period end (Level 2). 

The estimated fair values, and related carrying amounts, of the financial instruments and other assets included in the Company s financial statements at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 are as follows:

The Company has options outstanding under the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan. The shareholders of the Company approved the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the Restated Option Plan on August 5, 2015, which extended the term of the Stock Option Plan to June 10, 2025 and increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by an additional shares to shares. On August 29, 2018, August 26, 2020, and August 30, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved amendments to the Restated Option Plan increasing the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by an additional , , and shares, respectively.

No further awards may be granted under the Restated Option Plan. 

The 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced the Restated Option Plan, provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock to employees, directors and certain advisors of the Company at a price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and for periods not to exceed ten years.

of its dealership and office facilities. Generally, these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options. The Company uses leasing arrangements to maintain flexibility in its dealership locations and to preserve capital. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of its dealership and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past. Rent expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately million and million for the six-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Scheduled amounts and timing of cash flows arising from operating lease payments as of October 31, 2024, discounted at the weighted average interest rate in effect as of October 31, 2024 of approximately , are as follows:

Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax returns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns. Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its finance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax deduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price. These types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation, and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing difference. The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection for the Company s finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of Colonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company s overall effective state income tax rate. The actual interpretation of the regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter. The Company believes it satisfies the material provisions of the regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction at the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company s overall effective income tax rate as well as the timing of required tax payments.

The structure of the transaction is consistent with prior transactions whereby the Company did not acquire existing finance receivables and the seller may receive a performance-based earn-out in the future ranging from zero to a maximum of million based on cumulative pre-tax income. 

The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair values of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, all of which is deductible for tax purposes and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The Company recorded the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the TAC acquisition, which resulted in the recognition of: (1) net working capital assumed of , (2) inventory of million, (3) gross right use of asset and lease liability of million and (4) goodwill of million.

Overview 

America s Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation initially formed in 1981 (the Company ), is one of the largest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the used car market. The Company s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America s Car Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation Car-Mart of Arkansas ), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation Colonial ). References to the Company include the Company s consolidated subsidiaries. The Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the Company s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit difficulties. As of October 31, 2024, the Company operated 154 dealerships located primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States. 

Over the last ten fiscal years, the Company s revenue growth averaged 11.4 . Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2025 declined 4.3 compared to the same period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to a 9.3 decrease in retail units sold. The decrease was partially offset by a 3.9 increase in the average retail sales price and a 5.3 increase in interest income. Our dealership volume productivity averaged 30.3 sales per month for the first six months of fiscal 2025, down from 33.4 during the same period last year. 

The Company has been focused on improving vehicle quality by bringing lower mileage and on average newer model-year vehicles to our consumers, while balancing this with affordability. The Company believes this will aid in driving down our customers vehicle repair costs, reduce our service contract repair expenses, and lead to better recovery values in the event of repossession. When combined with inventory procurement efficiencies, these changes are expected to drive improved customer experience and contribute to better gross margins. 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with a leading automotive services and technology provider, to improve the efficiencies within the Company s inventory supply chain process. This partnership is allowing the Company to utilize reconditioning and auction facilities, which the Company expects will improve the Company s vehicle quality. 

Over the last five fiscal years, the Company s provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales averaged 26.36 , with a pre-pandemic rate of 23.71 in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2024, credit losses exceeded pre-pandemic levels, partially due to the inflationary pressure on customers and increasing interest rates from federal monetary policy. For the first six months of fiscal 2025, the provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales was 34.0 compared to 37.9 for the same period of fiscal 2024 as provision for credit losses decreased 15.9 with lower sales partially offsetting the improvements. Based on the Company s current analysis of credit losses, the allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2024 was 24.72 of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue and pending APP claims. 

The Company s credit losses and charge-offs are impacted by market and economic factors, including macro-economic conditions such as inflation in the cost of vehicle insurance, rent, groceries, the price of gasoline, childcare, and other staple items, and overall unemployment levels, as well as the personal income levels of the Company s customers. Historically, credit losses, on a percentage basis, also tend to be higher at new and developing dealerships than at longer tenure locations with experienced management. Generally, this is because the management at new and developing dealerships tends to be less experienced in making credit decisions and collecting customer accounts and the customer base is less seasoned. Normally more mature dealerships have more repeat customers and, on average, repeat customers are a better credit risk than non-repeat customers. 

The Company continuously looks for ways to operate more efficiently, improve its business practices and adjust underwriting and collection procedures. The Company has a proprietary credit scoring system which enables the Company to monitor the quality of contracts. Corporate office personnel monitor proprietary credit scores and work with dealerships when the distribution of scores falls outside of prescribed thresholds. Additionally, the Company s training department continuously strengthens its training for collections. The Company s collections department and support staff oversee collections and provide timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent basis. The Company believes that the proper execution of its business practices is the single most important determinant of its long-term credit loss experience. 

The Company s gross profit dollars per retail unit sold increased by 767, or 11.3 , during the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024, and gross margin as a percentage of sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased to 37.2 of sales, including a 150 bps benefit from the impact of the service contract accounting change in estimate for revenue recognition, from 34.6 in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit dollars per retail unit sold was primarily related to the impact of the accounting change during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 in the Company s estimated revenue recognition period for sales of its vehicle service contracts. The Company s initiatives around pricing discipline, reduced transportation costs and lower vehicle repair costs also contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The Company s gross margin is based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased, with higher-priced vehicles typically having higher gross margin dollars but lower gross margin percentages. Gross margin is also affected by the percentage of wholesale sales to retail sales, which relates, for the most part, to repossessed vehicles sold at or near cost. The Company plans to continue to focus on managing gross margin dollars in the near term, as demonstrated by the increase during the first six months of fiscal year 2025, as well as continuing to focus on improving wholesale results, cost controls, and operational improvement around the acquisition and disposal of vehicles. 

26

The Company consistently focuses on collections. Each dealership is responsible for its own collections with supervisory involvement and oversight from the corporate office. Total collections of principal, interest, and late fees for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased by 12.6 million, or 3.8 , over the prior year period. Principal collections, as a percentage of average finance receivables, increased slightly at 15.4 , compared to 15.2 in the same period in prior year. 

Hiring, training and retaining qualified associates is critical to the Company s success. The rate at which the Company adds new dealerships and is able to implement operating initiatives is limited by the number of trained managers and support personnel the Company has at its disposal. Excessive turnover, particularly at the dealership manager level, could impact the Company s ability to add new dealerships and to meet operational initiatives. The landscape for hiring remains very competitive. The Company has continued to add resources to recruit, train, and develop personnel, especially personnel targeted to fill dealership manager positions. The Company expects to continue to invest in the development of its workforce. 

The Company continues to prioritize investments to improve its products and services and operate more efficiently over time. One of the Company s largest recent investments has been improving its processes and technology for credit applications and decision-making through a new loan origination system LOS ). This online loan application system allows the consumer to apply for credit faster in anticipation of their vehicle purchase, authorize a soft credit pull during the application process, and receive a response via text message on the status of their application, as well as have access to centralized appointment-setting. At the end of October 2024, the Company had implemented the LOS in 145 of its 154 dealerships, with centralized decision-making on approvals of applications submitted via the online platform. The remaining nine dealerships, which were acquired, are still in their earn-out period or have yet to be integrated. Through the LOS, the Company has tightened its credit approval standards, primarily by requiring a higher down payment and shorter terms from certain customers.

Revenues decreased by approximately 12.5 million, or 3.5 , for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease resulted from a decline in revenue at dealerships that operated a full three months in both the current and prior year quarter 29.5 million decrease) and by dealerships that were closed during the prior year quarter 6.2 million decrease), partially offset by revenue growth from dealerships opened or acquired after the prior year quarter 23.2 million). The decline in revenue was related to a 9.1 decrease in retail units sold, largely reflecting the challenging macroeconomic environment for our customers, partially offset by a 3.6 increase in interest income and a 13.2 million benefit in service contract revenue. The service contract revenue was a result of a performance analysis on the Company s service contract program resulting in an accounting change in which the Company shortened its estimate for the revenue recognition period to better reflect the actual life of the service contract, which accelerated the Company s recognition of a portion of its related deferred revenue. . Interest income increased approximately 2.1 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, due to the 8.7 million increase in average finance receivables. 

Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 60.6 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 65.5 for the same period of the prior fiscal year, resulting in a gross margin as a percentage of sales of 39.4 for the current year period, including 2.9 from the impact of the service contract accounting change in estimate for revenue recognition, compared to 34.5 for the prior year period. The additional improvement in gross margin outside of the service contract adjustment resulted from better procurement processes and operational efficiencies. 

28

Gross margin as a percentage of sales is significantly impacted by the average retail sales price of the vehicles the Company sells, which is largely a function of the Company s purchase cost and includes the price of ancillary products sold with the vehicle, such as the APP and vehicle repair plans. As purchase costs increase, the margin between the purchase cost and the sales price of the vehicles the Company sells generally narrows on a percentage basis because the Company must offer affordable prices to its customers. The average retail sales price for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 20,031, a 996 increase over the prior year quarter. However, this increase was due to the 13.2 million benefit as a result of the service contract accounting change in estimate for revenue recognition, rather than as a result of purchase cost increases. The Company continues to focus on gross margin improvement through pricing discipline, reduced transportation costs and lower vehicle repair costs. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.6 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, an increase of 5.7 from the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are, for the most part, more fixed in nature. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 2.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company s two most recent acquisitions drove 2.1 million of the increase with the remainder related to stock compensation expense increases. The Company continued to have favorable declines in payroll and related costs as a result of prior cost cutting measures . 

Provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales was 34.8 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 45.1 for the prior year period. In overall dollars, the provision for credit losses decreased 35.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to the improved experience of contracts underwritten in the Company s new loan origination system. On a percentage of sales basis, the decrease in the provision was partially offset by a decrease in sales of 14.6 million compared to the prior year period. 

Interest expense as a percentage of sales increased to 6.3 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 5.5 for the prior year period. In dollar terms, interest expense increased 1.5 million due to increasing interest rates and an increase in the average borrowings of approximately 13.3 million during the three-month period ended October 31, 2024.

Revenues decreased by approximately 31.5 million, or 4.3 , for the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease resulted from a decline in revenue at dealerships that operated a full six months in both the current and prior year quarter 58.5 million decrease) and by dealerships that were closed during the prior year six-month period 12.1 million decrease); partially offset by revenue growth from dealerships opened or acquired after the prior year six-months 39.1 million). Revenue decline was primarily related to a 9.3 decrease in retail units sold, partially offset by a 21.3 increase in interest income and a 3.9 increase in the average retail sales price. Interest income increased approximately 6.2 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, due to the 27.5 million increase in average finance receivables. 

Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 62.8 for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 65.4 for the same period of the prior fiscal year, resulting in a gross margin as a percentage of sales of 37.2 for the current year period, including 1.5 from the impact of the service contract accounting change in estimate for revenue recognition, compared to 34.6 for the prior year period. The primary driver of this cost of sales decrease was the Company s continued focus on inventory efficiencies in procurement, remarketing, and repairs. The average retail sales price for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was 19,650, an increase of 736 or 3.9 over the prior year period. However, this increase was primarily due to the 13.2 million benefit in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 as a result of the service contract accounting change in estimate for revenue recognition, rather than as a result of purchase cost increases. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.4 for the six months ended October 31, 2024, an increase of 3.0 from the same period of the prior fiscal year. In dollar terms, overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 2.8 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company has made increasing investments in several areas including senior management, inventory procurement and management, customer experience and digital efforts. Increased collections costs due primarily to the higher frequency of repossessions, the addition of new dealerships through acquisitions since last year and the continuing impact of general inflation contributed to the remaining increase. The Company continues to focus on controlling costs, while at the same time ensuring a solid infrastructure to support a growing customer base with a high level of support for its customers. 

30

Provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales was 34.0 for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 37.9 for the six months ended October 31, 2023. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 13.0 for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 13.1 for the prior year period. The decrease in the provision is largely attributable to improvements in the frequency of losses, partially offset by a small increase in the severity of loss. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue and pending accident protection plan claims was 24.72 at October 31, 2024 compared to 26.04 at October 31, 2023 and 25.00 at July 31, 2024. The Company decreased the allowance for credit losses rate from 25.00 to 24.72 , sequentially, resulting in a 3.8 million change to the provision for credit losses. 

Interest expense as a percentage of sales increased to 6.3 for the six months ended October 31, 2024, compared to 5.1 for the prior year period. In dollar terms, interest expense increased 5.5 million due to increasing interest rates and an increase in the average borrowings of approximately 52.5 million during the six-month period ended October 31, 2024. Approximately 60 of the increase in interest expense was related to the increase in rates over the same period of the prior fiscal year.

Finance receivables, net, have increased 3.1 and 2.5 since April 30, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively, while revenues decreased 4.3 for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The Company currently anticipates that the growth in finance receivables will generally be slightly higher than overall revenue growth on an annual basis due to overall term length increases in our installment sale contracts, partially offset by improvements in underwriting and collection procedures in an effort to reduce credit losses. 

During the first six months of fiscal 2025, inventory increased by 14.6 million compared to inventory at April 30, 2024, primarily due to the most recent acquisition which added 5.0 million to the inventory balance. Annualized inventory turns decreased for the current year quarter at 6.0 versus the prior year s second quarter at 7.1. The Company strives to improve the quality of the inventory and maintain adequate turns while maintaining inventory levels to ensure an adequate supply of vehicles in volume and mix, and to meet sales demand. 

Property and equipment, net, decreased by 1.2 million at October 31, 2024 as compared to property and equipment, net, at April 30, 2024. The Company incurred 2.3 million in expenditures during the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily related to remodeling existing locations in order to support growth. The Company incurred 3.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense during the first six months of fiscal 2025. 

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by 18.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to accounts payable and accrued liabilities at April 30, 2024, related primarily to invoice management, vendor efficiencies and the timing of cash overdrafts for outstanding deposits at the end of the month. 

The Company had 1.6 million of income taxes payable, net at October 31, 2024 compared to 3.0 million of income taxes receivable, net at April 30, 2024. The change from income taxes receivable at April 30, 2024 to income taxes payable at October 31, 2024 was primarily due to a reduction in the credit loss provision and in increase in revenue recognized for the ancillary products due to a change in estimate during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 

31

Deferred revenue decreased 14.2 million at October 31, 2024 as compared to April 30, 2024, primarily resulting from the 13.2 million benefit in service contract revenue which was a result of the service contract accounting change in the Company s estimate for the applicable revenue recognition period. 

Deferred income tax liabilities, net, decreased approximately 5.5 million at October 31, 2024 as compared to April 30, 2024, primarily due to a net operating loss carryforward for the six months ended October 31, 2024. 

The Company had 656.4 million and 553.6 million of notes payable outstanding related to asset-backed term funding transactions as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. These non-recourse notes issued by the Company accrue interest at fixed rates with a weighted average rate of 9.1 as of October 31, 2024. . The Company completed its most recent issuance of asset-backed term funding on October 9, 2024, and used the proceeds of the issuance to pay down existing debt, including the 150 million balance borrowed under the Company s warehouse loan facility. Prior to the repayment of the warehouse loan facility, the funds borrowed under the facility accrued interest at a rate equal to the term SOFR plus 350 basis points. See Note F for further details on the non-recourse notes payable, warehouse loan facility and the revolving line of credit. 

On September 20, 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 1,700,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of 43.00. The net proceeds of the public offering were approximately 68.2 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering costs of approximately 4.9 million. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement entered into in connection with the offering, on October 22, 2024, the Company completed the sale of an additional 138,272 common stock at a price of 43.00 per share, in connection with a partial exercise by the underwriter of an option (the Over-Allotment Option granted in the Underwriting Agreement for the underwriters to purchase up to 255,000 additional shares at the public offering price to cover over-allotments. The net proceeds to the Company of the underwriter s partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option were approximately 5.6 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering costs of approximately 346,000. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to pay down a portion of the Company s revolving line of credit. 

Borrowings on the Company s revolving credit facilities fluctuate based upon a number of factors including (i) net income, (ii) finance receivables changes, (iii) funds available from asset-backed securitization offerings, warehouse facilities and/or other capital financing sources, (iv) income taxes, and (v) capital expenditures. Historically, income from operations, as well as borrowings on the revolving credit facilities and securitized debt, have funded the Company s finance receivables growth and capital asset purchases and, as applicable, common stock repurchases The overall increase in total borrowings during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was made to support an increase in finance receivables, with longer terms, and a growing customer base. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, the Company funded finance receivables growth of 34.0 million, increased inventory by 14.6 million, invested 13.5 million in dealership acquisitions, and reduced fixed assets by 1.2 million, with income from operations, increased total debt of 9.3 million, and the use of 25.9 million in cash available at April 30, 2024. The proceeds from the Company s common stock offering during the second quarter substantially offset the increase in total debt for the first six months of 2025.

The primary drivers of cash flows include (i) top line sales, (ii) interest income on finance receivables, (iii) gross margin percentages on vehicle sales, and (iv) credit losses, a significant portion of which relates to the collection of principal on finance receivables. Historically, most or all of the cash generated from operations has been used to fund finance receivables growth, capital expenditures, and as applicable, common stock repurchases. To the extent finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases have exceeded income from operations, the Company has increased borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and secured additional funding through the issuance of asset-backed non-recourse notes. 

Cash flows used in operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in finance receivable originations, an increase in finance receivable collections, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Finance receivables, net, increased by 34.0 million from April 30, 2024 to October 31, 2024.

The purchase price the Company pays for a vehicle has a significant effect on liquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost for the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result in higher selling prices. As the selling price increases, it generally becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company s customers have limited incomes and their vehicle payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. Several external factors can negatively affect the purchase cost of vehicles. Decreases in the overall volume of new vehicle sales, particularly domestic brands, lead to decreased supply in the used vehicle market. Also, constrictions in consumer credit, as well as general economic conditions, can increase overall demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale as used vehicles become more attractive than new vehicles in times of economic instability. A negative shift in used vehicle supply, combined with strong demand for used vehicles, results in increased used vehicle prices and thus higher purchase costs for the Company. 

Sustained macro-economic pressures affecting our customers have helped keep demand high in recent years for the types of vehicles we purchase. This strong demand for used vehicles, coupled with modest levels of new vehicle sales in recent years, have led to a generally ongoing tight supply of used vehicles available to the Company in both quality and quantity. Wholesale prices continue to soften in calendar year 2024 but remain high compared to the last several years. The Company expects the tight used vehicle supply and strong demand for the types of vehicles we purchase to continue to keep purchase costs and resulting sales prices elevated for the short-term, but anticipates that an increase in marketplace wages for our customers could enhance affordability. 

The Company has devoted significant efforts to improving its purchasing processes to ensure adequate supply at appropriate prices which includes the new partnership with an industry leader, expanding its purchasing territories to larger cities in close proximity to its dealerships and forming relationships with reconditioning partners to reduce purchasing costs. The Company has also increased the level of accountability for its purchasing agents including updates to sourcing and pricing guidelines. The Company continues to build relationships with national vendors that can supply a large quantity of high-quality vehicles. 

The Company s liquidity is also impacted by our credit losses. Macro-economic factors such as unemployment levels and general inflation on core and discretionary items can significantly affect our collection results and ultimately credit losses. Currently, as our customers look to cover rising costs of non-discretionary items, such as childcare, insurance, groceries and gasoline, it may impact our customers ability to make their vehicle payments. The Company has made improvements to its business processes via the implementation of the loan origination system during the last two years to strengthen controls and provide stronger infrastructure to support its collections efforts. Management continues to focus on improved execution at the dealership level, specifically as related to working individually with customers concerning collection issues. 

The Company s business model relies on leasing the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located. As of October 31, 2024, the Company leased approximately 87 of its dealership properties. The Company expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located. 

The Company s principal sources of liquidity include income from operations, proceeds from non-recourse notes payable issued under asset-back securitization transactions, warehouse facilities, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, and other potential debt or equity financing sources. At October 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 8.0 million of cash on hand and approximately an additional 97.0 million of availability under its revolving credit facilities (see Note F to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). The revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of September 30, 2025, with total permitted borrowings of 320 million at October 31, 2024. In July 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 7 to its revolving credit agreement to allow for, among other things, the entry into an amortizing warehouse agreement and to amend the fixed charge coverage ratio under the credit agreement. On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 8 to its revolving credit agreement that, among other things, reduces the total permitted borrowings under the revolving line of credit by 20 million to 320 million. Under the amendment, the Company is required to maintain a minimum amount available to be drawn under the credit facilities, based on eligible finance receivables and inventory, of 20 million. If the outstanding principal balance under the line of credit equals or exceeds 300 million, the Company will be required to maintain a minimum availability of 50 million. The amendment also required the Company to use the net proceeds of any junior capital raise of 50 million or more to pay down the then outstanding principal balance of the line of credit. The Company used the 73.8 million in aggregate net proceeds from its underwritten public common stock offering completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of the line of credit. The amendment also made certain modifications to the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the credit agreement and restricts the Company from making future repurchases of its common stock, along with the agreement s existing restrictions on other distributions to the Company s shareholders. Thus, the Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of the Company s lenders. 

34

In July 2024, the Company entered into a 150 million amortizing warehouse agreement backed by a portion of its finance receivables. The warehouse facility accrued interest at a rate of SOFR plus 350 basis points, with payments of principal and interest due monthly and a scheduled maturity date of July 12, 2026. The Company primarily used the funds from the warehouse facility to pay down the current revolving loan balance. On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the warehouse agreement that amends the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant consistent with Amendment No. 8 to the revolving credit agreement and modifies certain other financial covenants under the warehouse agreement. In October 2024, the Company used the proceeds from its most recent asset-back term securitization funding to pay down the outstanding balance under the warehouse loan facility. No debt was outstanding under the warehouse loan facility as of October 31, 2024. 

The Company expects to use cash from operations and other financing sources to (i) pay down the outstanding principal balance of the revolving line of credit, (ii) grow its finance receivables portfolio, (iii) purchase fixed assets of approximately 8 million in the next 12 months as we complete facility updates and general fixed asset requirements, (iv) fund dealership acquisitions as opportunities arise on terms acceptable to the Company, and (v) reduce the Company s remaining debt to the extent excess cash is available. 

The Company believes it will have adequate liquidity to continue to grow its revenues and to satisfy its capital needs for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date through expected financing sources such as additional securitized borrowings or public registered offerings. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has two standby letters of credit relating to insurance policies totaling 3.9 million at October 31, 2024. 

Other than its letters of credit, the Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangement that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Related Finance Company Contingency 

Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax returns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns. Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its finance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax deduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price. These types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing difference. The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection for the Company s finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of Colonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company s overall effective state income tax rate by approximately 250 basis points. The actual interpretation of the Regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter. The Company believes it satisfies the material provisions of the Regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction at the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company s overall effective income tax rate as well as the timing of required tax payments. 

The Company s policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of October 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company s estimates. The Company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses, which is discussed below. The Company s accounting policies are discussed in Note B to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses expected to be incurred on the portfolio at the measurement date in the collection of its finance receivables currently outstanding. At October 31, 2024, the weighted average contract term was 48.2 months with 35.9 months remaining. The allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2024 of 336.7 million, was 27.42 of the principal balance in finance receivables of 1.5 billion, less unearned accident protection plan revenue of 51.0 million and unearned service contract revenue of 55.6 million, less APP claims of 5.3 million. 

The allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate for the following reasons: 

estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require management to project future loan performance, including cash flows, prepayments, and charge-offs; 

the allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of management s control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions including, but not limited to, inflation; and 

judgment is required to determine whether the model used to generate the allowance for credit losses produces results that appropriately reflect a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. 

Because management s estimate of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment, such as the subjectivity of the assumptions used, there is uncertainty inherent in such estimates. Changes in these estimates could significantly impact the allowance and provision for credit losses. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Occasionally, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB or other standard-setting bodies, which the Company will adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes the implementation of recently issued standards which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. The guidance changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. This guidance will affect the Company s vintage disclosures related to current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this standard on May 1, 2023, under a prospective basis. In regard to installment sale contract modifications, management notes that the Company primarily modifies a customer s installment sale contract to allow for insignificant payment delays. This type of modification is generally done to account for payday changes for the customer and minor vehicle repairs. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which sets forth improvements to the current segment disclosure requirements in accordance with Topic 280 Segment Reporting, including clarifying that entities with a single reportable segment are subject to both new and existing segment reporting requirements. ASU 2023-07 will be effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU will result in additional disclosure, but will not impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (ASU 2023-09) related to income tax disclosures. The amendments in this update are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning May 1, 2025, and we do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

36

Seasonality 

Historically, the Company s third fiscal quarter (November through January) has been the slowest period for vehicle sales. Conversely, the Company s first and fourth fiscal quarters (May through July and February through April) have historically been the busiest times for vehicle sales. Therefore, the Company generally realizes a higher proportion of its revenue and operating profit during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. The Company expects this pattern to continue in future years. 

If conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on the Company s revenues and operating results for the year could be disproportionately large. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates. In particular, the Company has historically had exposure to changes in the federal primary credit rate and has exposure to changes in the prime interest rate of its lender. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes but has in the past entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk. 

Interest rate risk. The Company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its revolving credit facilities, and the interest rates charged to the Company under its credit facilities fluctuate based on its primary lender s base rate of interest. The Company had an outstanding balance on its revolving line of credit of 107.4 million at October 31, 2024. The impact of a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of approximately 10.7 million and a corresponding decrease in net income before income tax. 

The Company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on interest-bearing assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing notes payable. The Company s finance receivables carry a fixed annual interest rate based on the Company s contract interest rate as of the origination date of the installment sales contract, while its revolving credit facilities contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest rates. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company increased the interest rate by 0.25 . The Company s finance receivables now carry a fixed annual interest rate of 18.25 (up from 18.0 for all states, except Arkansas at 16.75 (which is subject to a usury cap of 17.0 ), Illinois (remains at 19.5 21.5 ), and acquired dealerships in Tennessee (which originate at up to 23.0 ). The interest rate on the Company s revolving credit facilities is generally SOFR plus 3.50 , or for non-SOFR amounts the base rate of 8.00 plus 1 at October 31, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

a) 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2024. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

b) 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ending October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

37

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has become a defendant in various types of legal proceedings. While the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect the final outcome of any of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. 

The coming maturity of the Company s revolving line of credit in September 2025 could adversely affect our business. 

The Company currently maintains a revolving line of credit with a group of lenders that permits the Company to borrow up to an aggregate of 320 million, which the Company has historically used to finance a portion of its finance receivables growth. Under the existing terms of the loan and security agreement, as amended, for the revolving credit facility, the facility is scheduled to mature in September 2025. The Company has initiated discussions with the lending group to begin the process for the extension of the revolver, and the Company expects that it will reach agreement on an extension given the Company s strong relationship with the lending group and the history of prior extensions of the credit facility. However, if the Company is unable to secure an extension of the revolving line of credit prior to its maturity date on terms that are acceptable to the Company, or at all, this could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. Our ability to extend the revolver will depend upon market conditions, our financial condition and the willingness of financing sources to make capital available to us at acceptable rates and terms. The inability to extend the revolving line of credit at acceptable rates and terms could restrict or limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and would require us to rely on other sources of financing, such as additional asset-backed term securitizations, warehouse loan agreements or a new revolving line of credit with other lenders. We cannot assure that we would be able to secure such other sources of financing at acceptable rates and terms to the Company or at all. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

The Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock under its common stock repurchase program. On December 14, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional one million shares along with the balance remaining under its previous authorization approved and announced on November 16, 2017. No shares were repurchased under the Company s stock repurchase program during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. 

The Company has not historically issued any dividends and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Payment of cash dividends in the future will be determined by the Company s Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, the Company s future earnings, operations, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions that may exist, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 

The Company is also currently restricted from paying dividends or making other distributions to its shareholders, including repurchasing shares of its common stock, without the consent of its lender under the Company s revolving credit agreement. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources under Item 2 of Part I for more information regarding this limitation.
