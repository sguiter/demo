CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, future capital expenditures; business strategies; goals, plans, and objectives; competitive strengths; market developments; development and operation of facilities; growth in sales volume; meeting capacity requirements; expansion of service to existing customers and service to new customers; future environmental regulations and remediation liabilities; electric customer credits; and the anticipated outcome of various regulatory and legal proceedings. Although the Registrants believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions (some of which may prove to be incorrect) and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the Registrants expectations. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with these forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following list identifies some of the factors that could cause the Registrants actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any of the Registrants forward-looking statements: 
 
 resolution of future rate cases, formula rate proceedings, and any negotiations, litigation, or delays in cost recovery related to these proceedings, 
 changes in environmental laws, regulations, decisions and policies, including present and potential environmental remediation costs, restrictions on GHG emissions, possible effects on Cleco s generation resources, or prohibitions or restrictions on new or existing services, and Cleco s compliance with these matters, 
 state and federal regulatory decisions or related judicial decisions disallowing or delaying recovery of capital investments, operating costs, commodity costs, and the ordering of refunds to customers and discretion over allowed return on investment, 
 the loss of regulatory accounting treatment, which could result in the write-off of regulatory assets and the loss of regulatory deferral and recovery mechanisms, 
 economic, regulatory, or workforce impacts related to pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks, 
 economic impacts related to conflicts and hostilities, including the current armed conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,

 changes in climate and weather conditions, including natural disasters such as wind and ice storms, hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires, and Cleco Power s ability to recover restoration and stranded costs associated with these events, 
 increased late or uncollectible customer payments due to costs related to volatile fuel prices, severe weather cost 

recoveries, or the costs of other events that are passed through to Cleco Power s customers, 
 economic conditions in Cleco s service areas, including inflation and the economy s effects on customer demand for and payment of utility services, 
 mechanical breakdowns or other i ncidents that could impair assets and disrupt operations of any of Cleco s generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, or other operations and may require Cleco to purchase replacement power or incur costs to repair the facilities, 
 growth or decline of Cleco s customer base, or decline in existing services, including the loss of key suppliers for fuel, materials, or services, or other disruptions to the supply chain, 
 wholesale and retail competition, including alternative energy sources, growth in customer-owned power resource technologies that displace utility-supplied energy or that may be sold back to the utility, and alternative energy suppliers and delivery arrangements, 
 blackouts or disruptions of interconnected transmission systems (the regional power grid), 
 terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, or other malicious acts that may damage or disrupt operating or information technology systems, including emerging artificial intelligence technologies that may be used to develop new hacking tools, exploit vulnerabilities, obscure malicious activities, and increase the difficulty in detecting threats, 
 changes in technology costs that impede Cleco s ability to effectively implement new information systems or to operate and maintain current production technology, 
 changes in Cleco s strategic business plans and/or key initiatives, which could be affected by any of the factors discussed herein, 
 the impact of Cleco s credit ratings, changes in interest rates, other capital market conditions, and global market conditions on financing through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, 
 the ability of Cleco to raise capital or secure funding, such as debt financing, private equity investment, tax credits, U.S. Department of Energy grants or loans, or partnerships, to execute its renewables and electrification initiatives, 
 changes to federal income tax laws, regulations, and interpretive guidance, including the IRA of 2022, 
 failure to meet expectations and report progress on ESG initiatives and GHG targets, as well as the increased focus on and activism related to ESG, which could limit Cleco s access to capital and/or financing, 
 declining energy demand related to customer energy efficiency, conservation measures, technological advancements, increased distributed generation, or changes in customers operating or business models, 
 industry and geographic concentrations of Cleco s counterparties, suppliers, and customers,

days after the billing date. Cleco recognizes write-offs within the allowance for credit losses once all recovery methods have been exhausted. It is the policy of management to review accounts receivable and unbilled revenue monthly using a reserve matrix based on historical bad debt write-offs, as well as current and forecasted economic conditions, to establish a credit loss estimate. Management s historical credit loss analysis included periods of economic recessions, natural disasters, and temporary changes to collection policies. Due to the critical necessity of electricity, these past events have not significantly impacted Cleco s credit loss rates. 
 Cleco s credit losses at September 30, 2024, were within range of its historical credit loss analysis.

million, net of adjustments as set forth in the Cleco Cajun Divestiture Purchase and Sale Agreement and adjustments based on net working capital. Also, in conjunction with the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture, the Cleco Cajun Sellers paid million to professional service firms that were engaged to facilitate the transaction. Cleco expects to receive an additional million months after closing, which is not contingent upon the post-divestiture performance of the divested business. This receivable is discounted to its net present value and recorded in Receivable - Cleco Cajun Divestiture on Cleco s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In connection with the sale, Cleco entered into an other services agreement and a transition services agreement to provide certain services to the Cleco Cajun Purchasers for up to twelve months. 
 In February 2019 in connection with the approval of the Cleco Cajun Acquisition, Cleco made commitments to the LPSC that included the repayment of million of Cleco Holdings debt by December 31, 2024. On April 26, 2024, the remaining million of that debt was paid and this LPSC commitment was satisfied. Interest expense on that debt is included in discontinued operations. 
 Cleco determined that the estimated fair value less the estimated cost to sell the Cleco Cajun Sale Group was less than the carrying value of the Cleco Cajun Sale Group. As a result, the Cleco Cajun Sale Group had an impairment of million at December 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, an additional impairment charge of million was recorded. On June 1, 2024, the Cleco Cajun Divestiture closed, and an incremental million loss on the sale of the Cleco Cajun Sale Group was recorded. This resulted in a cumulative loss related to the Cleco Cajun Divestiture of million. The incremental loss on the sale of the Cleco Cajun Sale Group recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024, was the difference between the fair value of the proceeds received and the derecognized net assets of the Cleco Cajun Sale Group on the closing date. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the working capital adjustments related to the Cleco Cajun Divestiture were finalized and resulted in a million decrease to the loss on the Cleco Cajun Divestiture that was previously recorded.

Deferred Lignite and Mine Closure Costs and Dolet Hills Power Station Closure Costs 
 In 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO made a joint filing with the LPSC seeking authorization to close the Oxbow mine and to include and defer certain accelerated mine closing costs in fuel and related ratemaking treatment. In 2021, the LPSC approved the establishment of a regulatory asset for certain lignite costs that would otherwise be billed through Cleco Power s FAC and any reasonable incremental third-party professional costs related to the closure of the mine. 
 In 2020, Cleco Power revised depreciation rates for the Dolet Hills Power Station to utilize the December 31, 2021, expected end-of-life and early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station and defer depreciation expense to a regulatory asset for the amount in excess of the previously approved depreciation rates by the LPSC. The Dolet Hills Power Station was retired on December 31, 2021. 
 In 2022, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC requesting approval of the regulatory treatment and recovery of stranded and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station over years as well as recovery of deferred fuel and mine-related costs. On April 19, 2024, the LPSC approved an uncontested settlement that contains a provision for a million reduction in the regulatory asset associated with the Dolet Hills Power Station. This amount was recorded as a reduction to the associated regulatory asset on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and an increase to Depreciation and amortization on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Statements of Income. At June 30, 2024, million of the ARO regulatory asset, which is related to the Dolet Hills Power Station, was reclassified to the Dolet Hills Power Station Closure Costs regulatory asset. This amount was included in the related securitization application filed with the LPSC on May 17, 2024. Management anticipates the securitization of these costs to close by the end of March 2025, and as a result, reclassified these costs as current Regulatory assets on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 For more information about the settlement, see Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Dolet Hills Prudency Review. 
 
 Solar Development Costs 
 In July 2022, Cleco Power entered into a long-term agreement to purchase, among other things, the output, capacity, and current and future environmental resource credits of a -MW solar electric generation facility to be constructed in DeSoto 

years once it begins purchasing power from the third party, which is expected by January 2027. 
 
 Residential Revenue Decoupling 
 Under the terms of Cleco Power s new FRP, effective July 1, 2024, Cleco Power implemented a residential revenue decoupling mechanism through its infrastructure and incremental cost recovery rider that provides a charge or credit to its residential customers for any under or over collection of residential base revenue as a result of changes in usage driven by weather or other measures. The under or over collection of residential base revenue is assessed on Cleco Power s rate year and an associated credit or charge for decoupling, not to exceed million, will be adjusted for the infrastructure and incremental cost recovery rider filings for July 2025 and 2026, respectively. 
 
 Storm Reserves 
 Cleco Power has a storm reserve to fund future storm restoration costs. Accumulated storm restoration costs that are probable of recovery from retail customers are netted against the storm reserve. At December 31, 2023, Cleco Power had a storm reserve balance of million, net of million of accumulated restoration costs. During 2024, Cleco Power s service territory was impacted by multiple severe weather events resulting in significant storm restoration costs. At September 30, 2024, Cleco Power had a storm reserve balance of million, net of million of accumulated storm restoration costs. For more information on the storm restoration costs associated with severe weather events that impacted Cleco Power s service territory, see Note 18 Storm Restoration.

FTRs 
 FTRs are financial instruments used to provide a financial hedge to manage the risk of transmission congestion charges 

between MISO nodes in MISO s Day-Ahead Energy Market. Cleco is awarded and/or purchases FTRs in auctions facilitated by MISO. FTRs are derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. 
 FTRs are valued using MISO s monthly auction prices as a price index reference (Level 3). Unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of Accumulated deferred fuel on the balance sheet in accordance with regulatory policy, and at settlement, realized gains or losses are included in Cleco Power s FAC and reflected on customers bills as a component of the fuel charge.

 RTO auction pricing FTR price - per MWh (1) The low and high prices reflect the lowest and highest values of all single point-to-point FTRs and not the range of aggregate price changes. 
 (2) The weighted average reflects the market price and volume of each commodity weighted by the total volume of commodities. 

Natural Gas Derivatives 
 Cleco may enter into physical and financial fixed price forward or options contracts that financially settle or are physically delivered at a future date. Management has not elected to apply hedge accounting to these contracts as allowed under applicable accounting standards. Cleco Power s natural gas derivative contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded as a component of Accumulated deferred fuel on the balance sheet. At settlement, realized gains or losses are included in Cleco Power s FAC and reflected on customer s bills as a component of the fuel charge. Prior to the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture, Cleco Cajun s unrealized gains or losses as well as realized gains or losses at settlement were recorded on the income statements as a component of fuel expense. After the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture in June 2024, all of Cleco Cajun s natural gas derivative contracts were liquidated. Upon liquidation, a million gain was recorded in Cleco s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of fuel expense.

 For Cleco and Cleco Power, the effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were different than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the amortization of excess ADIT, the adjustment to record tax expense at the projected annual effective tax rate, flow through of state tax benefits, and state tax expense. 
 Cleco s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was different primarily due to the amortization of excess ADIT, the adjustment to record tax expense at the projected annual effective tax rate, flow through of state tax benefits, and higher pre-tax book income in 2024 due to lower losses on gas-related derivative contracts at Cleco Cajun.

million. Gulf Coast Spinning Company, LLC (Gulf Coast), the primary plaintiff, alleges that Cleco promised to assist it in raising approximately million, which Gulf Coast needed to construct a cotton spinning facility near Bunkie, Louisiana (the Bunkie project). According to the petition filed by Gulf Coast in the 12 th Judicial District Court for Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, Cleco made such promises of funding assistance in order to cultivate a new industrial electric customer which would increase its revenues under a power supply agreement that it executed with Gulf Coast. Gulf Coast seeks unspecified damages arising from its inability to raise sufficient funds to complete the project, including lost profits. 
 Cleco filed an Exception of No Cause of Action arguing that the case should be dismissed. The 12 th Judicial District Court denied Cleco s exception in December 2015, after considering briefs and arguments. In January 2016, Cleco appealed the 12 th Judicial District Court s denial of its exception by filing with the Third Circuit Court of Appeal. In June 2016, the Third Circuit Court of Appeal denied the request to have the case dismissed. In July 2016, Cleco filed a writ to the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking a review of the 12 th Judicial District Court s denial of Cleco s exception. In November 2016, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Cleco s writ application. 
 In February 2016, the parties agreed to a stay of all proceedings pending discussions concerning settlement. In May 2016, the 12 th Judicial District Court lifted the stay at the request of Gulf Coast. The parties are currently participating in discovery. 
 Diversified Lands loaned million to Gulf Coast for the Bunkie project. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the Bunkie project site. Diversified Lands foreclosed on the Bunkie property in February 2020 and has also asserted claims personally against the former owner of Gulf Coast. These claims are based on contracts and credit documents executed by Gulf Coast, the obligations and performance of which were personally guaranteed by the former owner of Gulf Coast. Diversified Lands is seeking recovery of the indebtedness still owed by Gulf Coast to Diversified Lands following the February 2020 foreclosure. This action has been consolidated with the litigation filed by Gulf Coast in the 12 th Judicial District Court for Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. Discovery is ongoing and the trial date has been scheduled for April 2025. 
 Cleco believes all allegations made by Gulf Coast are contradicted by the written documents executed by Gulf Coast, are otherwise without merit, and that it has substantial meritorious defenses to the claims alleged by Gulf Coast.

billion. Cleco Power has responded to multiple sets of LPSC data requests. Cleco Power has FAC filings for January 2023 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. Historically, the disallowances have not been material. If a disallowance of fuel cost is ordered resulting in a refund, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Environmental Audit 
 In 2009, the LPSC approved Cleco Power to recover certain costs of environmental compliance through an EAC. The costs eligible for recovery are those for prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other things. Cleco Power has EAC filings for January 2023 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. Historically, the disallowances have not been material. If a disallowance of environmental cost is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco Power incurs environmental compliance expenses for reagents associated with the compliance standards of MATS. These expenses are also eligible for recovery through Cleco Power s EAC and are subject to periodic review by the LPSC. In May 2020, the EPA finalized a rule that concluded that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating units. The EPA also determined that the results of its risk and technology review did not require any revisions to the emissions standards. Several petitions for review of the rule s findings were filed between May and July 2020 in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2021, the Presidential Administration issued an executive order that specifically directed the EPA to consider issuing a proposed rule to suspend, revise, or rescind the rule. The EPA determined the most environmentally protective course is to implement the 

46 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

million and million for the 2022 and 2021 program years, respectively. 
 In May 2024, the LPSC approved the audit report for program years 2021 and 2022, which indicated no material findings. 
 On January 24, 2024, the LPSC voted to shift control of energy efficiency programs from utilities to an independent, third-party administrator selected by and accountable to the LPSC. This action will remove the provision whereby utilities were allowed to recover any lost revenues associated with unsold electricity. Cleco Power is subject to audits for program years 2023 and thereafter until the time these programs are shifted to the third-party administrator, which is expected in January 2026. 
 
 Dolet Hills Prudency Review 
 Cleco Power is seeking recovery for stranded and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station as well as deferred fuel and other mine-related closure costs. On February 2, 2024, the ALJ released a final recommendation indicating a partial disallowance of the recovery of fuel costs and a refund of related costs previously recovered from customers. Management estimated that a loss resulting from a potential disallowance was probable, and as a result, an estimated contingent loss of million was accrued in provision for rate refund as of December 31, 2023. 
 On April 19, 2024, the LPSC approved an uncontested settlement containing the following provisions: 
 
 a million reduction in the regulatory asset associated with the Dolet Hills Power Station, 
 refunding million per year to Cleco Power s retail customers as a credit to their bills during the third quarters of 2024, 2025, and 2026 for a total of million, and 
 allowing securitization of million. If the securitization is not complete by September 1, 2024, Cleco Power is allowed to accrue a carrying charge through the earlier of the completion of the securitization or January 31, 2025. 

As a result of the settlement, the following was recorded in Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2024: 
 
 a million reduction in regulatory assets with an offsetting increase recorded as depreciation expense and 
 a million increase in the provision for rate refund and electric customer credits. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, million was refunded to Cleco Power s retail customers as a credit to their bills in accordance with the settlement, as previously discussed. 
 On May 17, 2024, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC for a financing order authorizing the securitization. Management anticipates the securitization to close by the end of March 2025. 
 
 Other 
 Cleco is involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory, environmental, and administrative proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions, arbitrators, and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The liability Cleco may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters may be in excess of amounts currently accrued. Management regularly analyzes current information and, as of September 30, 2024, believes the probable and reasonably estimable liabilities based on the eventual disposition of these matters for Cleco and Cleco Power are million and million, respectively. Cleco and Cleco Power have accrued these amounts. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power have entered into various off-balance sheet commitments, in the form of guarantees and standby letters of credit, in order to facilitate their activities and the activities of Cleco Holdings subsidiaries and equity investees (affiliates). Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power have also agreed to contractual terms that require the Registrants to pay third parties if certain triggering events occur. These contractual terms generally are defined as guarantees. 
 Cleco Holdings entered into these off-balance sheet commitments in order to entice desired counterparties to contract with its affiliates by providing some measure of credit assurance to the counterparty in the event Cleco s affiliates do not fulfill certain contractual obligations. If Cleco Holdings had not provided the off-balance sheet commitments, the desired counterparties may not have contracted with Cleco s affiliates or may have contracted with them at terms less favorable to its affiliates. 
 The off-balance sheet commitments are not recognized on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets because management has determined that Cleco s and Cleco Power s affiliates are able to perform the obligations under their contracts and that it is not probable that payments by Cleco or Cleco Power will be required. 
 Cleco Holdings provided guarantees and indemnities to Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States as a result of the sale of the Perryville generation facility in 2005. The remaining indemnities relate to environmental matters that may have been present prior to closing. These remaining indemnities have no time limitations. The maximum amount of the potential payment to Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States is 

47 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

million, except for indemnities relating to the fundamental organizational structure of each respective entity, of which the maximum amount is million. Management does not expect to be required to make any payments under these indemnities. 
 As part of the Amended Lignite Mining Agreement, Cleco Power and SWEPCO, joint owners of the Dolet Hills Power Station, have agreed to pay the loan and lease principal obligations of the lignite miner, DHLC, when due if DHLC does not have sufficient funds or credit to pay. Any amounts projected to be paid would be based on the forecasted loan and lease obligations to be incurred by DHLC, primarily for reclamation obligations. As of September 30, 2024, Cleco Power does not expect any payments to be made under this guarantee. Cleco Power has the right to dispute the incurrence of such loan and lease obligations through the review of the mining reclamation plan before the incurrence of such obligations. The Amended Lignite Mining Agreement does not affect the amount the Registrants can borrow under their credit facilities. 
 Cleco has letters of credit to MISO pursuant to energy market requirements. The letters of credit automatically renew each year and have no impact on Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power s revolving credit facility. 
 Generally, neither Cleco Holdings nor Cleco Power has recourse that would enable them to recover amounts paid under their guarantee or indemnification obligations. There are assets held as collateral for third parties that either Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power could obtain and liquidate to recover amounts paid pursuant to the guarantees or indemnification obligations. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 Cleco has accrued for liabilities related to third parties, employee medical benefits, and AROs. 
 In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register for regulating the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants (CCR Rule). In August 2018, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated several requirements in the CCR regulation, which included eliminating the previous acceptability of compacted clay material as a liner for impoundments. As a result, in August 2020, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register that would set deadlines for costly modifications including retrofitting of clay-lined impoundments with compliant liners or closure of the impoundments. In November 2020, demonstrations were

Goodwill 
 On April 13, 2016, in connection with the completion of the 2016 Merger, Cleco recognized goodwill of billion. Management assigned the recognized goodwill to the Cleco Power reporting unit. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. 
 In performing the impairment test, Cleco compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 Cleco estimates the reporting unit s fair value using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. The income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance, including estimation of future cash flows related to capital expenditures, the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate and the assumed long-term growth rate approach, which incorporates management's assumptions regarding sustainable long-term growth. The market approach includes significant assumptions around the implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date. 
 Cleco performs an annual impairment test each August. In between annual tests, Cleco monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters, and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. While Cleco believes the assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from projections. To the extent cash flows, long-term growth rates, U.S. Treasury rates, or other factors outside of Cleco s control may impact Cleco s projected results, Cleco may be required to reduce all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill. 
 Cleco conducted its 2024 annual impairment test using an August 1, 2024, measurement date and determined that the estimated fair value of the Cleco Power reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed.

 On September 11, 2024, Hurricane Francine made landfall in southeast Louisiana as a Category 2 storm, causing power outages for approximately of Cleco Power s electric customers. By September 14, 2024, power was restored to all affected customers. Cleco Power s total storm restoration costs related to this weather event is estimated to be between million and million. 
 On October 8, 2024, Cleco Power made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval to withdraw storm restoration costs associated with the April 2024 storm, as well as costs associated with other storm events that occurred since December 2022, from the storm reserve. This request is currently under review by the LPSC. Management is assessing the accumulated restoration costs for Hurricane Francine as well as other storms that occurred in 2024 and anticipates filing an additional application seeking approval for withdrawal of these costs from the restricted storm reserve in 2025. For more information on the storm reserve, see Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Storm Reserves. 

of carbon dioxide emissions from Madison Unit 3 through various possible carbon capture and sequestration technologies. 
 Development efforts using an amine-based carbon capture technology began in 2022, and a million congressional appropriation was secured to help offset the costs associated with a related Feasibility study, a Pre-FEED study, and a FEED study. Both the related Feasibility study and the Pre-FEED study have been completed. The FEED study, which focused on the use of this amine-based carbon capture technology began in April 2024. Due to increases in the estimated investment required as well as the current economic and financing environment, Cleco Power s management decided to discontinue the current FEED study and transition to evaluate other potential carbon capture and sequestration technologies or alternatives to decarbonize Madison Unit 3, including fuel switching technology. As of September 30, 2024, Cleco Power has incurred a total of million related to Project Diamond Vault, of which Cleco Power has received million from a congressional appropriation and expects to receive an additional million to offset these costs.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Cleco uses its website, https://www.cleco.com, as a routine channel for distribution of important information, including news releases and financial information. Cleco s website is the primary source of publicly disclosed news about Cleco. Cleco is providing the address to its website solely for informational purposes and does not intend for the address to be an active link. The contents of the website are not incorporated into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The information included therein is essential to understanding the following discussion and analysis. Below is information concerning the consolidated results of operations of Cleco for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

OVERVIEW 
 Cleco is a regional energy company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its principal operating business segment, Cleco Power. Cleco Power is a regulated electric utility company that owns eight generating units with a total rated capacity of 2,676 MW and serves approximately 295,000 customers in Louisiana through its retail business and supplies wholesale power in Louisiana. 
 Many factors affect Cleco s primary business of generating, delivering, and selling electricity. These factors include the ability to increase energy sales while containing costs and the ability to successfully perform in MISO while subject to the related operating challenges and uncertainties. In addition, factors affecting Cleco Power include weather and the presence of a stable regulatory environment, which impacts the ROE and future rate cases, as well as the recovery of costs related to storms, growing energy demand, and volatile fuel prices; the ability to reliably deliver power to its jurisdictional customers; and the ability to comply with increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental standards. Significant events and major initiatives impacting Cleco and Cleco Power are discussed below. 

FRP 
 On June 19, 2024, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s new retail rate plan. Effective July 1, 2024, under the terms of the new FRP, Cleco Power is allowed to earn a target ROE of 9.7 , while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.3 . Additionally, 60.0 of retail earnings between 10.3 and 10.9 , and all retail earnings over 10.9 , are required to be refunded to customers. The amount of credits due to customers, if any, is determined by Cleco Power and the LPSC annually. For information on Cleco Power s FRP, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Regulation and Rates FRP. 
 
 Cleco Cajun Divestiture 
 In March 2023, Cleco Holdings management, with the support of its Board of Managers, committed to a plan of action for the disposition of the Cleco Cajun Sale Group. As a result, Cleco Holdings management determined that the criteria under GAAP for the Cleco Cajun Sale Group to be classified as held for sale were met, and the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on Cleco s future operations and financial results. Therefore, the results of operations and financial position of the Cleco Cajun Sale Group have been presented as discontinued operations since March 31, 2023. On June 1, 2024, the Cleco Cajun Divestiture closed. For more information, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3 Discontinued Operations. 
 
 Dolet Hills 
 Cleco Power is seeking recovery of stranded and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station as well as deferred fuel and other costs associated with the closure of the Oxbow mine. On February 2, 2024, the ALJ released a final recommendation indicating a partial disallowance of the recovery of fuel costs and a refund of related costs previously recovered from customers. Management estimated that a loss resulting from a potential disallowance was probable, and as a result, an estimated contingent loss of 58.7 million was accrued in provision for rate refund as of December 31, 2023. Cleco Power recorded an additional loss of 1.3 million as of March

31, 2024, as a result of the approval of the uncontested settlement by the LPSC on April 19, 2024. 
 On April 19, 2024, the LPSC approved an uncontested settlement containing the following provisions: 
 
 a 40.0 million reduction in the regulatory asset associated with the Dolet Hills Power Station, 
 refunding 20.0 million per year to Cleco Power s retail customers as a credit to their bills during the third quarters of 2024, 2025, and 2026 for a total of 60.0 million, and 
 allowing securitization of 305.0 million. If the securitization is not complete by September 1, 2024, Cleco Power is allowed to accrue a carrying charge through the earlier of the completion of the securitization or January 31, 2025. 
 
 On May 17, 2024, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC authorizing a financing order for the securitization.

 ESG 
 Cleco is accelerating its efforts to protect the environment, manage social relationships, govern responsibly, and ensure accountability. To protect the environment, Cleco is increasing its renewable and electrification initiatives. Cleco is also aiming to reduce GHG emissions in ways such as incorporating renewable energy resources into its generating fleet, as it replaces coal-fired generation units retired after serving their useful lives. Cleco aims to sustainably reduce its GHG emissions by approximately 60.0 by 2030, with aspirations of net zero emissions by 2050. To manage social relationships, Cleco plans to ensure that the electricity that it generates is affordable, reliable, and sustainable. Cleco also continues to support community investment opportunities across its service territory and has created a workforce culture that rewards inclusion, safety, and innovation. To govern responsibly, Cleco plans to continue operating according to policies and practices that support the governance framework. To ensure accountability, Cleco has created an ESG Steering Committee and appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer to oversee the continued implementation of ESG initiatives. Currently, management is unable to predict the impact of implementing these ESG initiatives on the Registrants. For more information on these ESG initiatives, see Part I, Item 1, Business Human Capital Diversity and Inclusion, Communities, and Oversight and Governance in the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. For more information about Cleco s environmental initiatives, see Decarbonization Initiatives and Renewable and Electrification Initiatives. 
 On March 24, 2024, the SEC issued a rule requiring certain registrants to provide climate-related disclosures in their annual reports and registration statements. This rule is effective for Cleco s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2027. In April 2024, the SEC issued a voluntary stay on the implementation of the rule amidst pending litigation, which delayed the rule indefinitely pending completion of a judicial review. Management is currently assessing the impact this rule will have on the Registrants. Management is also unable to predict the outcome and timing 

of the stay and pending litigation and the effect it may have on this rule. 
 
 Tax Reform 
 On August 16, 2022, the IRA of 2022 became law. The IRA of 2022 seeks to lower gasoline and electricity prices, increase energy security, and help consumers afford emissions-cutting technologies. In addition, the IRA of 2022 provides tax credits for clean electricity sources and energy storage, as well as creates programs to enable states and electric utilities to transition to clean power. There are several tax and renewables provisions in this legislation that could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. These include provisions related to direct pay and credit transferability, enhanced carbon capture and sequestration credits, new technology-neutral clean energy investment credits, and new technology-neutral clean energy production credits. These credits are expected to help fund future renewable and electrification projects. Management continues to monitor any potential impact the IRA of 2022 could have on the Registrants. In addition, the IRA of 2022 could increase business growth in Cleco s service territory. 
 
 Decarbonization Initiatives 
 In April 2022, Cleco Power announced Project Diamond Vault, a proposed project with the goal of reducing up to 95 of carbon dioxide emissions from Madison Unit 3 through various possible carbon capture and sequestration technologies. 
 Development efforts using an amine-based carbon capture technology began in 2022, and a 9.0 million congressional appropriation was secured to help offset the costs associated with a related Feasibility study, a Pre-FEED study, and a FEED study. Both the related Feasibility study and the Pre-FEED study have been completed. The FEED study, which focused on the use of this amine-based carbon capture technology began in April 2024. Due to increases in the estimated investment required as well as the current economic and financing environment, Cleco Power s management decided to discontinue the current FEED study and transition to evaluate other potential carbon capture and sequestration technologies or alternatives to decarbonize Madison Unit 3, including fuel switching technology. As of September 30, 2024, Cleco Power has incurred a total of 18.2 million related to Project Diamond Vault, of which Cleco Power has received 5.9 million from a congressional appropriation and expects to receive an additional 1.0 million to offset these costs. At June 30, 2024, Cleco Power expensed 10.8 million of previously deferred project costs due to the uncertainty of recoverability. Given that the unique nature of these project costs did not relate to Cleco s core operations, these costs were removed from Construction work in progress on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and expensed to Other expense, net on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024, Cleco Power incurred an additional 0.5 million of project costs and recorded these costs in Other expense, net on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Management is considering the most economically viable decarbonization strategy and remains committed to addressing Cleco Power s carbon output of its solid fuel generating unit and ESG goals to sustainably reduce its GHG emissions.

For more information on environmental matters that could affect Madison Unit 3 and Cleco Power s decarbonization initiatives, see Results of Operations Regulatory and Other Matters Environmental Matters. 
 
 Renewable and Electrification Initiatives 
 On July 22, 2022, Cleco Power entered into a long-term agreement to purchase, among other things, the output, capacity, and current and future environmental resource credits of a 240-MW solar electric generation facility to be constructed in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana and owned by a third party. In September 2024, the LPSC approved the agreement, including the recovery of 2.1 million of incurred development costs. The LPSC also approved Cleco Power s recovery of future costs to construct, own, operate, and maintain the transmission line necessary to deliver the energy from the solar generation facility to Cleco Power s transmission grid. Cleco Power expects to begin receiving output from this facility by 2027. For information about the regulatory asset associated with Cleco Power s solar development costs, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Solar Development Costs. 
 Cleco Power is also pursuing electrification initiatives for its customers such as gas compression, e-trucking, green tariffs, residential heating programs, and increasing the supply of light duty electric vehicles and forklifts, among others. 
 Cleco Power is seeking available funds from the U.S. government for funding of these electrification initiatives. Cleco Power cannot predict the likelihood that any funding from the U.S. government ultimately will be approved. 
 
 DSMART Project 
 The DSMART project includes modernization of Cleco Power s distribution system by replacing or upgrading distribution line equipment to utilize new and emerging technologies to facilitate automatic fault isolation, service restoration, and fault location. The project is expected to provide savings through a reduction in outage restoration time and improve operational efficiencies and time to locate faults. The project is also expected to improve safety and reliability of Cleco Power s distribution assets by minimizing outage patrols and improving situational awareness in the distribution operations center. The total estimated project cost is 90.2 million. The project implementation will be completed in phases, and management expects the total project will be completed by the end of 2028. Cleco Power is currently in the second phase of the project. As of September 30, 2024, Cleco Power had spent 64.1 million on the project. 
 
 Grid Resiliency and Hardening 
 In 2023, the LPSC Staff proposed a final rule for LPSC consideration and adoption setting guidelines and requirements for utilities to develop grid resilience plans in an effort to enhance the state of Louisiana s collective ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from risks posed to the electric system. Management is unable to determine the outcome and timing of approval of this proposed rule. 
 Cleco Power is actively participating in programs to enhance its grid resilience against growing threats of extreme weather and climate change. Cleco Power has identified another possible course of action to improve the resilience of its electric system. This may include potential hardening projects aimed at reinforcing or replacing critical infrastructure 

on Cleco Power s transmission and distribution systems with materials that can better withstand extreme weather events, avoid or mitigate customer outages from such events, and facilitate faster restoration after such events. Cleco Power anticipates filing an application with the LPSC by the end of 2024 for approval of a proposed grid resilience plan. 
 
 Other 
 Cleco Power is working to secure load growth opportunities that include renewing existing franchises, pursuing new franchises, and adding new retail load opportunities with large industrial, commercial, and residential customers. The retail opportunities include sectors such as agriculture, oil and gas, chemicals, metals, national accounts, government, military, wood, paper, health care, information technology, transportation, clean and green fuels, data centers, and other manufacturing. 
 On March 31, 2024, a contract with a significant wholesale customer expired and was not renewed with Cleco Power. The absence of this agreement affected jurisdictional retail rates that were reviewed by the LPSC in conjunction with Cleco Power s most recent rate case. The LPSC approved Cleco Power s new rate plan effective July 1, 2024.

 Cleco Power s residential customers demand for electricity is affected largely by weather. Weather is generally measured in cooling degree-days and heating degree-days. A high number of cooling degree-days may indicate consumers will use more air conditioning, while a high number of heating degree-days may indicate consumers will use more heating. An increase in heating degree-days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree-days because alternative heating sources are more readily available, and winter energy is typically priced below the rate charged for energy used in the summer. Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days are calculated for a month by separately calculating the average actual heating and cooling degree-days for that month over a period of 30 years. 
 The following chart shows how cooling degree-days varied from normal conditions and from the prior period. Cleco Power uses weather data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to determine degree-days.

 Base 
 Base revenue increased 8.4 million primarily due to 31.0 million of higher rates largely resulting from the implementation of Cleco Power s new retail rate plan. Also contributing to the increase was 5.8 million of lower excess ADIT. These increases were partially offset by 17.3 million of lower usage from milder summer weather and 12.7 million of lower wholesale revenue primarily due to the expiration of a wholesale contract in March 2024. 
 For information on the effects of future energy sales on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of Cleco Power, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Future Electricity Sales in the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Fuel Cost and Purchased Power Recovery/Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Changes in fuel costs historically have not significantly affected Cleco Power s net income. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such expenses. Approximately 95 

54 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

of Cleco Power s total fuel cost during the third quarter of 2024 was regulated by the LPSC. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC which may result in a refund to customers. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by customer usage, the per unit cost of fuel used for electric generation, and the dispatch of Cleco Power s generating facilities by MISO. Cleco Power s incremental recoverable fuel and purchased power expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were impacted primarily by lower natural gas costs as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For more information on Cleco Power s most current fuel audits, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Fuel Audits. 
 
 Other Operations Revenue 
 Other operations decreased 7.6 million primarily due to lower transmission revenue resulting from the expiration of a wholesale contract in March 2024. 
 
 Non-Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Non-recoverable fuel and purchased power decreased 4.1 million primarily due to lower transmission costs resulting from the expiration of a wholesale contract in March 2024.

 Base 
 Base revenue increased 13.5 million primarily due to 38.5 million of higher rates largely resulting from the implementation of Cleco Power s new retail rate plan. Also contributing to the increase was 5.6 million of lower excess ADIT and 5.4 million of higher demand charges from new industrial customers in the third quarter of 2023. These increases were partially offset by 25.2 million of lower wholesale revenue largely due to the expiration of a wholesale contract in March 2024 and 11.1 million of lower usage from milder summer weather. 
 For information on the effects of future energy sales on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of Cleco Power, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Future Electricity Sales in the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Fuel Cost and Purchased Power Recovery/Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Changes in fuel costs historically have not significantly affected Cleco Power s net income. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such expenses. Approximately 86 of Cleco Power s total fuel cost during the first nine months of 2024 was regulated by the LPSC. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC which may result in a refund to customers. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by customer usage, the per unit cost of fuel used for electric generation, and the dispatch of Cleco Power s generating facilities by MISO. Cleco Power s incremental recoverable fuel and purchased power expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were impacted primarily by lower natural gas costs as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For more information on Cleco Power s most current fuel audits, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Fuel Audits. 
 
 Other Operations Revenue 
 Other operations revenue decreased 10.0 million primarily due to lower transmission revenue resulting from the expiration of a wholesale contract in March 2024. 
 
 Affiliate Revenue 
 Affiliate revenue increased 6.8 million primarily due to higher internal software services provided in accordance with service agreements. 
 
 Non-Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Non-recoverable fuel and purchased power decreased 8.0 million primarily due to lower transmission costs resulting from the expiration of a wholesale contract in March 2024. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expense 
 Other operations and maintenance expense increased 6.0 million primarily due to 4.5 million of higher employee-related expenses largely resulting from the transfer of employees from Support Group and Cleco Cajun to Cleco Power and 1.9 million of higher outside service costs primarily related to information technology support and legal fees. These increases were partially offset by 0.9 million of lower maintenance costs. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 46.5 million primarily due to 40.0 million for a reduction in the regulatory asset associated with the Dolet Hills Power Station as a result of the settlement of the Dolet Hills prudency review and 5.3 million for changes in estimated useful lives of internal software. For more information on the reduction in the regulatory asset associated with the Dolet Hills Power Station and the settlement of the Dolet Hills prudency review, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Deferred Lignite and Mine Closure Costs and Dolet Hills Power Station Closure Costs and Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures

Non-GAAP Measure 
 The financial results in the following table are presented on an accrual basis. EBITDA is a key non-GAAP financial measure used by the CEO to assess the operating performance of Cleco s segment; however, it is not indicative of future performance. Management evaluates the performance of Cleco s segment and allocates resources to it based on segment profit and the requirements to implement strategic initiatives and projects to meet current business objectives. EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. 
 Cleco s segment structure and its allocation of corporate expenses were updated to reflect how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the nearest comparable GAAP financial performance measure, to EBITDA for the Cleco Power reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023:

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General Considerations and Credit-Related Risks 
 
 Credit Ratings and Counterparties 
 Financing for operational needs and capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows depends 

upon the cost and availability of external funds through both short- and long-term financing. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms could negatively affect Cleco s ability to maintain or expand its businesses. Access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic and capital market conditions, regulatory authorizations and policies, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power s credit ratings, cash flows from routine operations, and credit ratings of project counterparties. After assessing the current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power, management believes that Cleco will have access to the capital markets at prevailing market rates for companies with comparable credit ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power at September 30, 2024: 
 
 SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT CORPORATE/LONG-TERM ISSUER S P MOODY S FITCH S P MOODY S FITCH Cleco Holdings BBB- Baa3 BBB- BBB 
 Baa3 BBB- Cleco Power A- 
 A3 BBB+ A- A3 BBB 
 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 
 On June 7, 2024, and following the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture, S P upgraded its ratings for Cleco Holdings from BBB- to BBB at the issuer level and Cleco Power from BBB+ to A- at both the issuer and issue level. S P revised its ratings due to the expected improvement in business risk from having a fully regulated utility business after the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture. 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power pay fees and interest under their bank credit agreements based on the highest rating held. If Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power s credit ratings were to be downgraded, Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power, respectively, could be required to pay additional fees and incur higher interest rates for borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities. 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power may be required to provide credit support with respect to bilateral transactions and contracts that they have entered into or may enter into in the future. The amount of credit support required may change based on margining formulas, changes in credit agency ratings, or liquidity ratios. 
 Cleco Power participates in the MISO market. MISO requires participants to provide credit support which may increase or decrease due to the timing of the settlement schedules and MISO margining formulas. For more information about MISO, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Transmission Rates in the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. For more information about credit support see Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees. 
 
 Global and U.S. Economic Environment 
 Global and domestic economic conditions may have an impact on Cleco s business and financial condition. Access to capital markets is a significant source of funding for both short- and long-term capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash 

57 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

flows. During periods of capital market volatility, the availability of capital could be limited and the costs of capital may increase for many companies. Although the Registrants have not experienced restrictions in the financial markets, their ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when the Registrants would like, or need, to do so. Any restrictions could have a material impact on the Registrants ability to fund capital expenditures or debt service, or on their flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Credit constraints could have a material negative impact on the Registrants lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to the Registrants or to delay payment of such obligations. The higher interest rate environment the Registrants have been exposed to has negatively affected interest expense on variable rate debt and positively affected interest income for the Registrants short-term investments. 
 In recent years, inflationary pressures have increased substantially. Under established regulatory practice, historical costs have traditionally formed the basis for recovery from customers. As a result, Cleco Power s future cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs may not be adequate to replace property, plant, and equipment in future years. For information on the impacts of inflation and market price volatility of natural gas on credit loss reserves related to customer accounts receivable, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Reserves for Credit Losses. 
 
 TCJA 
 At June 30, 2024, all amounts for the TCJA unprotected excess ADIT had been returned to Cleco Power s retail customers. Cleco Power s retail customers will continue receiving bill credits for the TCJA protected excess ADIT until the full amount has been returned. For more information on the regulatory impact of the TCJA, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Regulation and Rates TCJA. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Various accounting pronouncements require certain assets and liabilities to be measured at their fair values. For more information, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Fair Value Accounting Instruments.

Working Capital and Debt 
 
 Cleco 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco had no outstanding borrowings under its aggregate 475.0 million revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, Cleco had 110.0 million of short-term debt for outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit 

facilities. For more information on Cleco s revolving credit facilities, see Credit Facilities. 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco s long-term debt and finance leases outstanding, excluding fair value adjustments resulting from the 2016 merger, was 3.06 billion, of which 240.9 million was due within one year. The long-term debt due within one year at September 30, 2024, primarily represents Cleco Power s 125.0 million bank term loan due in May 2025; 50.0 million of Cleco Power s senior notes due in December 2024; 50.0 million of Cleco Power s GO-Zone bonds with a mandatory tender in April 2025; and 15.1 million of Cleco Securitization I storm recovery bond principal payments scheduled to be paid in 2025. 
 In February 2019 in connection with the approval of the Cleco Cajun Acquisition, Cleco made commitments to the LPSC that included the repayment of 400.0 million of Cleco Holdings debt by December 31, 2024. On April 26, 2024, Cleco Holdings paid the remaining 66.7 million satisfying this LPSC commitment. In addition, on June 4, 2024, Cleco Holdings redeemed its 165.0 million floating rate senior notes due on May 1, 2025. 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents available of 248.9 million combined with 475.0 million of available revolving credit facility capacity 175.0 million from Cleco Holdings and 300.0 million from Cleco Power) provided total liquidity of 723.9 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Cleco had a working capital surplus of 417.1 million and a deficit of 17.5 million, respectively. The 434.6 million increase in working capital is primarily due to: 
 
 a 255.2 million increase in regulatory assets primarily due to the reclassification of the Dolet Hills and mine-related regulatory assets to short-term as a result of Cleco Power expecting the securitization of those amounts to be completed by the end of March 2025, 
 a 126.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, 
 a 110.0 million decrease in short-term debt due to payments on Cleco Holdings revolving credit facility, 
 a 38.4 million decrease in provision for rate refund primarily due to the reclassification of the long-term portion of refunds to be made to Cleco Power s retail customers and the third quarter 2024 refund issued to Cleco Power s retail customers resulting from the settlement of the Dolet Hills prudency review. For more information about the settlement, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees LPSC Audits and Reviews Dolet Hills Prudency Review, 
 a 19.4 million increase in fuel inventory primarily due to higher coal volume with higher transportation costs driven by lower usage from a decrease in market gas prices, partially offset by lower petroleum coke volume at a lower price per ton, 
 a 15.9 million decrease in long-term debt and finance leases due within one year primarily due to the repayment of Cleco Holdings 66.7 million term loan, partially offset by the reclassification of Cleco Power s 50.0 million GO-Zone bonds with a mandatory tender in April 2025, 
 a 15.0 million decrease in energy risk management liabilities primarily due to lower mark-to-market losses on gas related derivative contracts as a result of the liquidation of 

58 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

Cleco Cajun s natural gas derivative contracts following the Cleco Cajun Divestiture, 
 a 14.7 million increase in materials and supplies inventory primarily due to higher purchases of transmission and distribution inventory in order to support future needs and mitigate future supply chain uncertainty, 
 a 14.2 million decrease in regulatory liabilities primarily due to the amortization of the TCJA regulatory liability, 
 a 13.1 million decrease in postretirement benefit obligations primarily due to pension plan contributions made in 2024, 
 a 10.3 million increase in affiliate accounts receivable due to estimated income taxes paid by Cleco Holdings on behalf of Cleco Group, and 
 a 9.9 million increase in other current assets primarily due to the accrual of short-term and long-term incentive compensation. 
 
 These increases in working capital were partially offset by: 
 
 a 120.5 million decrease in the net assets and liabilities held for sale as a result of the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture. For more information about assets and liabilities held for sale, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3 Discontinued Operations , 
 a 64.4 million increase in taxes payable primarily due to higher provision for federal income taxes and accruals for property taxes, 
 a 17.6 million increase in interest accrued primarily due to the timing of interest payments on long-term debt, and 
 a 9.3 million increase in affiliate accounts payable primarily due to an increase in the amounts payable to Cleco Group for income taxes. 
 
 Cleco Holdings 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco Holdings had no short-term debt outstanding under its 175.0 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2023, Cleco Holdings had 110.0 million of short-term debt for outstanding borrowings under its 175.0 million revolving credit facility. For more information on Cleco Holdings revolving credit facility, see Credit Facilities.

 On September 20, 2024, Cleco Holdings individual 10.0 million uncommitted line of credit expired. Previously, this line of credit was being renewed on an annual basis. For more information on Cleco s uncommitted line of credit, see Credit Facilities. 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco Holdings long-term debt outstanding, excluding fair value adjustments, was 1.18 billion, of which none was due within one year. 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents available at Cleco Holdings of 185.3 million combined with 175.0 million of available revolving credit facility capacity provided a total liquidity of 360.3 million. 
 Cleco Power 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Cleco Power had no outstanding borrowings of short-term debt under its 300.0 million revolving credit facility. For more information on Cleco Power s revolving credit facility, see Credit Facilities. 

On September 20, 2024, Cleco Power s individual 10.0 million uncommitted line of credit expired. Previously, this line of credit was being renewed on an annual basis. For more information on Cleco s uncommitted line of credit, see Credit Facilities. 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco Power s long-term debt and finance leases outstanding was 1.87 billion, of which 240.9 million was due within one year.

 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents available of 49.6 million combined with 300.0 million of available revolving credit facility capacity provided a total liquidity of 349.6 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Cleco Power had a working capital surplus of 197.6 million and a working capital deficit of 66.2 million, respectively. The 263.8 million increase in working capital is primarily due to: 
 
 a 255.2 million increase in regulatory assets primarily due to the reclassification of the Dolet Hills and mine-related regulatory assets to short-term as a result of Cleco Power expecting the securitization of those amounts to be completed by the end of March 2025, 
 a 38.4 million decrease in provision for rate refund primarily due to the reclassification of the long-term portion of refunds to be made to Cleco Power s retail customers and the third quarter 2024 refund issued to Cleco Power s retail customers resulting from the settlement of the Dolet Hills prudency review. For more information about the settlement, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees LPSC Audits and Reviews Dolet Hills Prudency Review, 
 a 19.4 million increase in fuel inventory primarily due to higher coal volume with higher transportation costs driven by lower usage from a decrease in market gas prices, partially offset by lower petroleum coke volume at a lower price per ton, 
 a 14.7 million increase in materials and supplies inventory primarily due to higher purchases of transmission and distribution inventory in order to support future needs and mitigate future supply chain uncertainty, 
 a 14.3 million decrease in energy risk management liabilities primarily due to lower mark-to-market losses on gas-related derivative contracts, 
 a 14.2 million decrease in regulatory liabilities primarily due to the amortization of the TCJA regulatory liability, and 
 a 13.1 million decrease in postretirement benefit obligations primarily due to pension plan contributions made in 2024. 

59 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

These increases in working capital were partially offset by: 
 
 a 50.6 million increase of long-term debt and finance leases due within one year primarily due to the reclassification of 50.0 million GO-Zone bonds with a mandatory tender in April 2025, 
 a 24.6 million increase in taxes payable primarily due to higher provision for federal income taxes and accruals for property taxes, 
 a 16.4 million increase in affiliate accounts payable primarily due to an increase in the amounts payable to Cleco Holdings for income taxes, 
 a 13.4 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to an increase in storm accruals related to the restoration efforts for Hurricane Francine, partially offset by lower accruals for fuel, and 
 a 12.0 million increase in interest accrued primarily due to the timing of interest payments on long-term debt. 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco had two separate revolving credit facilities, one for Cleco Holdings in the amount of 175.0 million and one for Cleco Power in the amount of 300.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. These revolving credit facilities were entered into on May 17, 2024, and replaced the existing agreements. The total of all revolving credit facilities maintains a maximum aggregate capacity of 475.0 million. 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power each elected not to renew its individual 10.0 million uncommitted lines of credit that were used to support working capital needs. The individual uncommitted lines of credit allowed up to 10.0 million in short-term borrowings, but no more than 10.0 million in the aggregate. These lines of credit were previously being renewed on an annual basis; however, on September 20, 2024, these lines of credit expired. 
 Cleco Holdings revolving credit facility provides funding for working capital and other financing needs. The revolving credit facility includes restrictive financial covenants and matures in May 2029. Under covenants contained in Cleco Holdings revolving credit facility, Cleco is required to maintain total indebtedness, not including securitization indebtedness, less than or equal to 65 of total capitalization. At September 30, 2024, Cleco Holdings was in compliance with the covenants of its revolving credit facility.

 Cleco - Net Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 56.1 million, which includes net cash used related to discontinued operations of 3.7 million, primarily due to: 
 
 38.8 million of lower recoveries of fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to the timing of collections at a lower fuel rate at Cleco Power, 
 25.8 million of higher minimum required contributions made for the pension plan at Cleco Power, 
 14.6 million of higher payments for non-capital severe weather events, 
 the absence of 6.5 million of cash collateral remitted to counterparties for Cleco Cajun s natural gas derivatives, and 
 4.7 million of higher payments for fuel inventory primarily due to lower volume of purchases for petroleum coke at Cleco Power. 
 
 These decreases were partially offset by: 
 
 17.5 million of lower payments for fuel inventory primarily due to lower volume of purchases of coal at Cleco Cajun, 
 9.6 million of lower interest paid on debt, and 
 8.6 million of lower prepayments largely due to the timing of property insurance payments and lower deposits on prepaid inventory.

Contractual Obligations 
 Cleco, in the normal course of business activities, enters into a variety of contractual obligations. Some of these result in direct obligations that are reflected in Cleco s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties, that are not reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information regarding Cleco s Contractual Obligations, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Contractual Obligations in the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power have entered into various off-balance sheet commitments, in the form of guarantees and standby letters of credit in order to facilitate their activities and the activities of Cleco Holdings subsidiaries and equity investees (affiliates). Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power have also agreed to contractual terms that require them to pay third parties if certain triggering events occur. These contractual terms generally are defined as guarantees. For more information about off-balance sheet commitments and

Regulatory and Other Matters 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 Cleco is subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations, and to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities. In addition, existing environmental laws, regulations, and permits could be revised or reinterpreted; new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to Cleco or its facilities; and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, including potential regulatory and enforcement developments related to air emissions, water and/or waste management. Cleco may incur significant additional costs to comply with these revisions, reinterpretations, and requirements. Cleco Power could then seek recovery of additional environmental compliance costs as riders through the LPSC s EAC or FRP. If Cleco fails to comply with these revisions, reinterpretations, and requirements, it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines. 
 On May 8, 2024, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register that would regulate CCR Management Units (MUs), which includes non-containerized accumulations of CCR on the land at facilities otherwise subject to federal CCR regulations. For more information, see Note 14 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Other Commitments. 
 On May 9, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under the Section 111 GHG Rule. The rule rescinds the ACE regulation, and sets carbon dioxide standards for existing coal-fired units, existing natural-gas fired boilers, and new combustion turbines. For the existing units, the state will be required to submit an implementation plan to the EPA by May 11, 2026. The final rule requires significant reductions in CO 2 emissions for existing EGUs. Cleco is currently working to complete its review of the final regulation. Cleco s compliance with this final rule could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Also, on May 9, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Water Act. The regulation continues to allow facilities to comply with the bottom ash transfer water limit of zero discharge by committing to cease coal burning at the respective EGU by December 31, 2028. In addition, the final regulation also places discharge limits on landfill leachate and on the legacy wastewater in retiring impoundments. Until a review of the final regulation has been completed, Cleco is unable to predict if this will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow of the Registrants. 
 Cleco is currently evaluating possible impacts various proposed environmental rules may have on its generating units. For a discussion of other Cleco environmental matters, see Item 1, Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14 Litigation, Other

Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) 
 NERC, subject to oversight by FERC, is the ERO responsible for developing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards for users, owners, and operators of the bulk power system. NERC, as the ERO, delegates authority to the SERC Reliability Corporation. 
 A revised NERC reliability standard relating to the winterization of generation assets became effective on April 1, 2023. This revised standard requires the implementation of cold weather preparedness plans that include geographical based freeze protection measures, annual inspections, unit design temperature basis, and employee training. A new winterization standard requiring additional freeze protection measures has been approved by FERC with an effective date of October 1, 2024, and a targeted implementation period of 60 months from the effective date . Management does not expect this new standard to have any impact on Cleco s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 A NERC Operations and Planning Reliability Standards audit is co nducted at least every three years for Cleco Power. The next Operations and Planning Reliability Standards audit for Cleco Power is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2025. 
 A NERC CIP audit is also conducted at least every three years for Cleco Power. The next audit is scheduled to begin in 2025. 
 Management is unable to predict the final outcome of any future audits or whether any findings will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financ ial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For a discussion of risks associated with FERC s regulation of Cleco Power s transmission system, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Reliability and CIP Standards Compliance in the Registrants Combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 
 The IRP process includes conducting stakeholder meetings and receiving feedback from stakeholders. The final IRP was filed with the LPSC in May 2023. On March 21, 2024, the LPSC issued an order acknowledging that Cleco Power s Final IRP complied with the LPSC s IRP General Order. The LPSC s acknowledgement completes this IRP cycle. The next IRP cycle is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
 The IRP report describes how Cleco Power plans to meet its forecasted load requirements on a reliable and economic basis, while reducing Cleco Power s carbon footprint. The IRP is used as a guide in future decision-making and does not represent firm operational commitments. 
 
 Service Quality Plan (SQP) 
 In October 2015, the LPSC proposed an SQP containing 21 requirements for Cleco Power. The SQP has provisions relating to employee headcount, customer service, reliability, 

vegetation management, and reporting. In April 2016, the SQP was approved by the LPSC. The SQP expired in December 2020; however, Cleco continued to maintain its compliance with the SQP. On March 28, 2024, Cleco Power filed its annual SQP monitoring report for 2023 based on the expired reporting requirements. 
 A request to renew the conditions of the expired SQP was included in Cleco Power s application for its most recent rate case, which was approved by the LPSC on June 19, 2024. As a result, all parties are required to engage and present an amended and extended SQP, including an implementation plan and timeline, 90 days from the issuance of the LPSC order approving the settlement of the rate case, which was on July 17, 2024. On October 15, 2024, Cleco Power filed a proposed amended and extended SQP with the LPSC. Cleco Power is unable to determine the outcome and timing of this process. 
 
 Franchises 
 Two parish franchise agreements remain expired, and Cleco Power is continuing to make efforts in 2024 to renew these contracts. There is no financial impact to Cleco s business as a result of the expired franchise agreements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.

CLECO POWER NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Cleco Power meets the conditions specified in General Instructions H(1)(a) and (b) to Form 10-Q and is, therefore, permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly owned subsidiaries of reporting companies. Accordingly, Cleco Power has omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the information called for by Item 2 (Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Item 3 (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk) of Part I of Form 10-Q and the following Part II items of Form 10-Q: Item 2 (Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds) and Item 3 (Defaults upon Senior Securities).

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

RISK OVERVIEW 
 Cleco is exposed to counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and commodity price risk. Cleco has implemented a governance framework, inclusive of risk policies and procedures to help manage these and other risks. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Cleco is exposed to counterparty credit risk when a counterparty fails to meet their financial obligations which causes Cleco to incur replacement cost losses. Cleco may be exposed when it enters certain transactions such as commodity derivative or physical commodity transactions directly with market participants and contracts with retail electric customers that require Cleco to construct grid facilities for the purpose of serving those customers . Cleco enters into long-form contract and master agreements with counterparties that govern the risk of counterparty credit default and allow for collateralization above prenegotiated thresholds to help mitigate potential losses. Alternatively, Cleco may be required to provide credit support with respect to bilateral transactions and contracts that Cleco has entered into or may enter into in the future. The amount of credit support required may change based on margining formulas, changes in credit agency ratings or liquidity ratios. 
 Cleco monitors and manages its credit risk exposure through credit risk management policies and procedures that require retail customer and counterparty credit quality review and monitoring, establishment of credit and default terms in bilateral contracts and master agreements, monitoring changing credit exposure as compared to fair value, and collateralization and other methods of counterparty credit assurance. 
 For more information, see Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources General Considerations and Credit-Related Risks. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Access to capital markets is a significant source of funding for both short- and long-term capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruption in the capital and credit markets may potentially increase the costs of capital and limit the ability to access the capital markets. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms could negatively affect Cleco s ability to maintain and expand its business. After assessing the current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power, management believes that Cleco will have access to the capital markets at prevailing market rates for companies with comparable credit ratings. For more information, see Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources General Considerations and Credit-Related Risks. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Cleco monitors its mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix, for example, refinancing balances outstanding under its variable-rate bank facilities with fixed-rate debt or vice versa. Calculations of the changes in 

fair market value and interest expense of the debt securities are made over a one-year period. 
 Sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable-rate obligations is computed by assuming a 1 change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt. 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco Holdings had no short-term debt outstanding under its 175.0 million revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, the borrowing costs under Cleco Holdings revolving credit facility were equal to SOFR plus 1.725 or ABR plus 0.625 , plus commitment fees of 0.275 paid on the unused portion of the facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco Power had no short-term debt outstanding under its 300.0 million revolving credit facility. The borrowing costs under Cleco Power s 300.0 million revolving credit facility are equal to SOFR plus 1.35 or ABR plus 0.25 , plus commitment fees of 0.15 paid on the unused portion of the facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, Cleco Power had a 125.0 million long-term variable rate bank term loan outstanding, at an interest rate of SOFR plus 1.35 or ABR plus 0.25 , for an all-in interest rate of 6.20 . Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco Power s long-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco Power s pretax earnings of 1.3 million on an annualized basis. The weighted average rate for the outstanding term loan debt at Cleco Power for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 6.68 . 
 Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco s short- and long-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco s consolidated pretax earnings of 1.3 million on an annualized basis. 
 Cleco may enter into contracts to mitigate the volatility in interest rate risk. These contracts include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks. For each reporting period presented, the Registrants did not enter into any contracts to mitigate the volatility in interest rate risk. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Cleco Power s financial performance can be adversely impacted by the volatility in future fuel and power prices, which may impact customer costs passed through Cleco Power s FAC; therefore, Cleco Power has implemented a natural gas hedging program to mitigate the volatility of customer costs. The program includes transacting in financially settled swaps, physical fixed price supply agreements, and financially settled options contracts. Cleco Power executes this program within a risk management framework inclusive of risk management policies, procedures, and guidelines, set forth by its Board of Managers and management. Cleco Power may be exposed to transmission congestion price risk as a result of physical transmission constraints present between MISO locational marginal price nodes when serving customer load. Cleco Power is awarded and/or purchases FTRs in auctions facilitated by MISO. FTRs are accounted for as derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. 
 Some of these transactions may qualify for the normal purchase, normal sale (NPNS) exception under derivative accounting guidance. Contracts that do not qualify for NPNS accounting treatment or are not elected for NPNS accounting treatment are marked-to-market and recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. 

64 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2024 3RD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cleco Cajun and Cleco Power had natural gas derivative contracts consisting of fixed price physical forwards and financially settled swap and/or options contract transactions. After the closing of the Cleco Cajun Divestiture, all natural gas derivative contracts related to Cleco Cajun were liquidated during June 2024. Cleco monitors the Value at Risk (VaR) of its natural gas derivative contracts requiring derivative accounting treatment. VaR is defined as the maximum expected loss over a given holding period at a given confidence level based on observable market prices and volatilities. Cleco uses a parametric variance-covariance model methodology to 

estimate VaR using a combination of implied and historical volatilities within a 5-day holding period at a 95 confidence interval. Given Cleco s reliance on historical data, VaR is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or abnormal shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors, even when weighted toward more recent observations, may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. VaR should be evaluated in light of this and the methodology s other limitations. 
 The following table presents the VaR of natural gas derivative contracts based on these assumptions: 

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPT. 30, 2024 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPT. 30, 2024 (THOUSANDS) AT SEPT. 30, 2024 HIGH LOW AVERAGE HIGH LOW AVERAGE Cleco

Statements Note 6 Fair Value Accounting Instruments and Note 7 Derivative Instruments. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power (individually, Registrant and collectively, the Registrants management, including the CEO and CFO, the Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluations, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Registrants disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by each Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in 

SEC rules and forms; and that the Registrants disclosure controls and procedures are also effective in ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrants management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Registrants internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants internal control over financial reporting.
