Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In the normal course of business, in an effort to help keep our stockholders and the public informed about our operations, from time to time, we may issue such forward-looking statements, either orally or in writing. Generally, these statements relate to business plans or strategies; including our strategic partnership with Workday, Inc.; projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies; or projections involving anticipated revenues, earnings, average number of worksite employees WSEEs ), benefits and workers compensation costs, or other operating results. We base these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, the actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: 
 adverse economic conditions;

 impact of inflation; 
 vulnerability to regional economic factors because of our geographic market concentration; 
 failure to comply with covenants under our credit facility; 
 impact of a future outbreak of highly infectious or contagious disease; 
 our liability for WSEE payroll, payroll taxes and benefits costs, or other liabilities associated with actions of our client companies or WSEEs, including if our clients fail to pay us;

 an adverse determination regarding our status as the employer of our WSEEs for tax and benefit purposes and an inability to offer alternative benefit plans following such a determination; 
 cancellation of client contracts on short notice, or the inability to renew client contracts or attract new clients; 
 the ability to secure competitive replacement contracts for health insurance and workers compensation insurance at expiration of current contracts; 
 regulatory and tax developments and possible adverse application of various federal, state and local regulations;

of our costs related to health insurance coverage are provided under our policy with United. While the policy with United is a fully insured plan, as a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Effective January 1, 2020, under the amended agreement with United, we no longer have financial responsibilities for a participant s annual claim costs that exceed 1 million Individual Claims Limit ). Accordingly, we record the cost of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs ), as benefits expense, which is a component of direct costs, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimated incurred but not reported claims are based upon: (1) the level of claims processed during each quarter; (2) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development

 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and a liability for the excess costs would be accrued in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of million, which is reported as long-term prepaid health insurance. In addition, United requires a deposit equal to approximately one day of claims funding activity, which was million at September 30, 2024, and is included in deposits - health insurance as a long-term asset on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, Plan Costs were less than the net premiums paid and owed to United by million. As this amount is in excess of the agreed-upon million surplus maintenance level, the million difference is included in prepaid insurance, a current asset, in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The premiums, including the additional quarterly premiums, owed to United at September 30, 2024 were million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our benefits costs incurred in the first nine months of 2024 included a decrease of million for changes in estimated run-off related to prior periods, net of Individual Claims Limit. Our benefits costs incurred in the first nine months of 2023 included a decrease of million for changes in estimated run-off related to prior periods, net of Individual Claims Limit. 
 
 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of million per policy year for claims that exceed million. Chubb bears the financial responsibility for all claims in excess of these levels. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of million per policy year for claims that exceed million. 
 Because we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment. 
 We utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of WSEEs job responsibilities, the location of WSEEs, the historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers compensation claims cost estimates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reduced accrued workers compensation costs by million and million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior periods. Workers compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate utilized in the 2024 period was and in the 2023 period was and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

 The current portion of accrued workers compensation costs on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes million and million, respectively, of workers compensation administrative fees. 
 The undiscounted accrued workers compensation costs were million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of September 30, 2023. 
 At the beginning of each policy period, the workers compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims claim funds ). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated WSEE payroll levels and expected workers compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits workers compensation, a long-term asset in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, we had restricted cash of million and deposits workers compensation of million, of which million was held in a trust account. 
 Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions revenues are primarily derived from our gross billings, which are based on (1) the payroll cost of our WSEEs; and (2) a markup computed as a percentage of the payroll cost. The gross billings are invoiced concurrently with each periodic payroll of our WSEEs. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings and therefore consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform their service at the client worksite. 
 In determining the pricing of the markup component of our gross billings, we take into consideration our estimates of the costs directly associated with our WSEEs, including payroll taxes, benefits and workers compensation costs, plus an acceptable gross profit margin. As a result, our operating results are significantly impacted by our ability to accurately estimate our direct costs relative to the revenues derived from the markup component of our gross billings.

 . Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to an alternate base rate or Adjusted Term SOFR for term SOFR loans, in either case plus an applicable margin. Adjusted Term SOFR is a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate plus a spread adjustment, which ranges from to depending on the interest period and type of loan. Depending on our leverage ratio, the applicable margin varies (1) in the case of SOFR loans, from to and (2) in the case of alternate base rate loans, from to .

 Key Operating Metrics 
 We monitor certain key metrics to measure our performance, including: 
 WSEEs 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EPS 
 Our growth in the number of WSEEs paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in WSEEs paid at existing clients through new hires and employee terminations. 
 
 During Q3 2024, average WSEEs paid decreased 2 compared to Q3 2023. The number of WSEEs paid from new client sales declined compared with Q3 2023, while client retention and the net change in our client base remained consistent with Q3 2023. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024 YTD 2024 ), average WSEEs paid decreased 1 compared to the first nine months of 2023 YTD 2023 ). The number of WSEEs paid from new client sales, the net change in our client base, and client retention declined when compared to YTD 2023.

Revenues 
 
 Our PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions revenues are primarily derived from our gross billings, which are based on (1) the payroll cost of our WSEEs and (2) a monthly markup component. 
 Our revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of WSEEs paid each period and the number of WSEEs enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our monthly markup is computed in part as a

 Gross Profit 
 In determining the pricing of the markup component of our gross billings, we take into consideration our estimates of the costs directly associated with our WSEEs, including payroll taxes, benefits and workers compensation costs, plus an acceptable gross profit margin. As a result, our operating results are significantly impacted by our ability to accurately estimate our direct costs relative to the revenues derived from the markup component of our gross billings. 
 Our gross profit per WSEE is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing Solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per WSEE per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables below. 
 Non-GAAP Measure Definition Benefit of Non-GAAP Measure Non-bonus payroll cost Non-bonus payroll cost is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of bonus payrolls paid to our WSEEs. Bonus payroll cost varies from period to period, but has no direct impact to our ultimate workers compensation costs under the current program. Our management refers to non-bonus payroll cost in analyzing, reporting and forecasting our workers compensation costs. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to the costs incurred under our current workers compensation program. Adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Excludes funds associated with: federal and state income tax withholdings, employment taxes, other payroll deductions, and client prepayments. We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior periods, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our lenders to assess our leverage and ability to make interest payments. EBITDA Represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus: interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and amortization of SaaS implementation costs. Adjusted EBITDA Represents EBITDA plus: non-cash stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income Represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: non-cash stock-based compensation. Adjusted EPS Represents diluted net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: non-cash stock-based compensation.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our expansion plans, stock repurchases, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements and other operating cash needs. To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct costs and operating expenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations. Longer-term projects, large stock repurchases or significant acquisitions may be financed with public or private debt or equity. We have a revolving credit facility Facility with a syndicate of financial institutions with a current borrowing capacity of 650 million. The Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. We have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources. 
 We had 486 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024, of which approximately 255 million was payable in early October 2024 for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, approximately 19 million represented client prepayments that were payable in October 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 200 million compared to 159 million at December 31, 2023. We currently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for the remainder of 2024. We intend to rely on these same sources, as well as public and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling 370 million under the Facility. Please read Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt , for additional information. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 99 million. Our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our clients. Our cash and cash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities, are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts. These include the following: 
 Timing of client payments / payroll taxes We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the client s payroll funding, from clients no later than the same day as the payment of WSEE payrolls and associated payroll taxes. Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows. For example, many WSEEs are paid on Fridays; therefore, operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday or a Monday. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the last business day of the reporting period was a Monday, client prepayments were 19 million and employment taxes and other deductions were 255 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the last business day of the reporting period was a Friday, client prepayments were 20 million and employment taxes and other deductions were 483 million, which included 149 million of funds related to client employee retention tax credits received on their behalf from the Internal Revenue Service that were distributed to clients in early October 2023.

 Workers compensation plan funding During YTD 2024, we received 38 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers compensation program, which resulted in an increase in working capital. 
 
 Medical plan funding Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. Therefore, changes in the participation level of the United plan have a direct impact on our operating cash flows. In addition, changes to the funding rates, which are solely determined by United based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends, also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, Plan Costs were less than the net premiums paid and owed to United by 28 million, which is 19 million in excess of our agreed-upon 9 million surplus maintenance level. The 19 million difference is therefore reflected as a current asset and 9 million is reflected as a long-term asset on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024. In addition, the premiums owed to United at September 30, 2024, were 39 million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Operating results Our adjusted net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Our adjusted net income decreased 27 to 134 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 183 million in the first nine months of 2023. Please read Results of Operations . 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities were 25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to property and equipment purchases. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities were 163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We paid 67 million in dividends and repurchased or withheld 52 million in stock. In addition, client funds liability and other financing activities decreased by 44 million.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AND CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our cash equivalent short-term investments, our available-for-sale marketable securities and our borrowings under our Facility, which bears interest at a variable market rate. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling 370 million under the Facility. Please read Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt , for additional information. 
 The cash equivalent short-term investments consist primarily of overnight investments, which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk, except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned on these investments. Our available-for-sale marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. 
 We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through diversification and low investment turnover. Our investment policy is designed to maximize after-tax interest income while preserving our principal investment. As a result, our marketable securities consist of primarily short-term U.S. Government Securities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
