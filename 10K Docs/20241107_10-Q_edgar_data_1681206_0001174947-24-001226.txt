of the outstanding shares of common stock of
NI Holdings. Nodak Insurance then became a wholly-owned stock subsidiary of NI Holdings. Prior to completion of the Nodak conversion,
NI Holdings conducted no business and had no assets or liabilities. As a result of the Nodak conversion, NI Holdings became the holding
company for Nodak Insurance and its existing subsidiaries. 

These unaudited consolidated financial statements
include the financial position and results of operations of NI Holdings and the following other entities: 

Nodak Insurance Company 

Nodak Insurance is the largest domestic property
and casualty insurance company in North Dakota, offering private passenger auto, homeowners, farmowners, commercial multi-peril, crop
hail, and Federal multi-peril crop insurance coverages through its captive agents in the state. 

Nodak Agency, Inc. 

Nodak Agency is an inactive shell corporation. 

American West Insurance Company 

American West is a property and casualty insurance
company licensed in eight states in the Midwest and Western regions of the United States U.S. ). American West began writing
policies in 2002 and primarily writes private passenger auto, homeowners, and farm coverages in South Dakota. American West also writes
private passenger auto coverage in North Dakota, as well as crop hail and Federal multi-peril crop insurance coverages in Minnesota and
South Dakota. 

Primero Insurance Company 

Primero is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tri-State,
Ltd. Tri-State, Ltd. is an inactive shell corporation owned by Nodak Insurance. Primero is a property and casualty insurance company
writing non-standard auto coverage in the states of Nevada, Arizona, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Primero was acquired by Nodak Insurance
in 2014. 

Battle Creek Insurance Company 

Battle Creek is a property and casualty insurance
company writing private passenger auto, homeowners, and farm coverages solely in the state of Nebraska. Battle Creek became affiliated
with Nodak Insurance in 2011 and, prior to January 2, 2024, was controlled by Nodak Insurance via a surplus note. On January 2, 2024,
Battle Creek issued shares of its common stock to Nodak Insurance at a per share par value and became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Nodak Insurance. Because we concluded that we controlled Battle Creek prior to January 2, 2024, we consolidated the financial statements
of Battle Creek, and Battle Creek s policyholders interest in Battle Creek was reflected as a non-controlling interest in
shareholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for NI Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets and its net
income or loss was excluded from net income or loss attributed to NI Holdings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for NI Holdings Consolidated Statements of Operations ). Subsequent to January 2, 2024, Battle Creek is fully consolidated in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations and, as such, no longer reflected as a non-controlling interest. 

Direct Auto Insurance Company 

Direct Auto is a property and casualty insurance
company licensed in Illinois. Direct Auto began writing non-standard auto coverage in 2007, and was acquired by NI Holdings on August
31, 2018, via a stock purchase agreement.

, subject to certain
post-closing adjustments, including a post-closing payment to NI Holdings for the amount by which the ending statutory surplus balance
for Westminster exceeded . The post-closing payment received from Scott Insurance Holdings during the third quarter of 2024 was
 and has been included as an adjustment to the purchase price for the calculation of the loss on the sale of Westminster. The sale
of Westminster, which represented the majority of our Commercial segment in prior periods, was a strategic shift that has had a major
effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, Westminster has been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented in this Form
10-Q. All current and prior periods reflected in this Form 10-Q have been presented as continuing and discontinued operations, unless
otherwise noted. For additional information see Part I, Item 1, Note 19 Discontinued Operations of this Form 10-Q.

We, along with our investment advisor, frequently
review our investment portfolio for declines in fair value that could be indicative of credit losses. Beginning on December 31, 2022,
credit losses are recognized through an allowance account. We consider a number of factors when determining if an allowance for credit
losses is necessary, including payment and default history, credit spreads, credit ratings and rating actions, and probability of default.
We determine the credit loss component of fixed income investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine the present

for fixed income securities at the time of adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard and have not recognized any credit losses
for fixed income securities since adoption of the credit loss standard. Therefore, there were no beginning or ending balances of credit

in excess of a retention. With the exception
of Westminster, a per risk excess of loss treaty provides coverage of in excess of for property risks and in excess
of for casualty risks. For Westminster, a per risk excess of loss treaty provided coverage of in excess of for property
risks and in excess of for casualty risks until July 1, 2024. Additionally, a property per-risk facultative contract is
in place to provide coverage up to in excess of per property. Aggregate stop loss reinsurance agreements are also in place
for both crop hail and multi-peril crop coverage. The crop hail aggregate attaches at a net loss ratio providing 50 points of cover.
The multi-peril crop aggregate attaches at a net loss ratio providing 45 points of cover. In addition to the aggregate covers, underlying
multi-peril crop reinsurance is provided through the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation FCIC ). 

Effective July 1, 2024, the Company s reinsurance
contracts were modified to exclude any Westminster losses occurring on or after that date, while maintaining all other existing limits,
retentions, and attachment points. 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company s
catastrophe retention and retention limit were consistent with those for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. In addition,
limits, retentions, and attachment points in our other reinsurance contracts were also consistent with those for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024 (with the exception of Westminster for which per risk excess of loss treaties provided coverage of in
excess of for property risks and in excess of for casualty risks). 

The Company actively monitors and evaluates the financial
condition of the reinsurers and develops estimates of the uncollectible amounts due from reinsurers. Beginning on December 31, 2022, credit
losses are recognized through an allowance account developed using a new credit loss model (current expected credit losses or CECL ).
See the Part II, Item 8, Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.
Credit loss estimates are made based on periodic evaluation of balances due from reinsurers, changes in reinsurer credit standing, judgments
regarding reinsurers solvency, known disputes, reporting characteristics of the underlying reinsured business, historical experience,
current economic conditions, and the state of reinsurer relations in general. Collection risk is mitigated by entering into reinsurance
arrangements only with reinsurers that have strong credit ratings and statutory surplus above certain levels. At September 30, 2024, and
December 31, 2023, management has concluded that it is not necessary to record an allowance for expected credit losses related to reinsurance
recoverables. All of our significant reinsurance partners are rated A- (Excellent) or better by AM Best, and there is no
history of write-offs.

Intercompany Reinsurance Pooling Arrangement 

Effective January 1, 2020, all of our insurance subsidiary and affiliate
companies entered into an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement. Nodak Insurance is the lead company of the pool, and assumes the
net premiums, net losses, and underwriting expenses from each of the other five companies. Nodak Insurance then retrocedes balances back
to each company, while retaining its own share of the pool s net underwriting results, based on individual pool percentages established
in the respective pooling agreement. This arrangement allows each insurance company to rely upon the capacity of the pool s total
statutory capital and surplus. As a result, they are evaluated by AM Best on a group basis and hold a single combined financial strength
rating, long-term issuer credit rating, and financial size category. Subsequent to the June 30, 2024, date of sale, Westminster is no
longer a member of the pool, and the pooling percentages for the remaining insurance subsidiaries were updated based on their respective
surplus as a percentage of the pool as of December 31, 2023.

Dividends 

State insurance laws require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain
certain minimum capital and surplus amounts on a statutory basis. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that restrict
the payment of dividends from statutory surplus and may require prior approval from their domiciliary insurance regulatory authorities.
Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to risk-based capital requirements that may further affect their ability to pay dividends.
Our insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2023, exceeded the amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary
to satisfy risk-based capital requirements by a significant margin. For information regarding the availability of subsidiaries to pay
dividends to NI Holdings during 2024, see Item II, Part 8, Note 12 Related Party Transactions section of the 2023 Annual
Report.

All fees associated with the plans are deducted from the
eligible employee accounts. 

The Company also offers a non-qualified deferred compensation
plan to key executives of the Company (as designated by the Board of Directors). The Company s policy is to fund the plan by amounts
that represent the excess of the maximum contribution allowed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act over the key executives 
allowable 401(k) contribution. The plan also allows employee-directed deferral of key executives compensation or incentive payments.
The Company reported expenses related to this plan totaling and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

In connection with our initial public offering IPO in March 2017, the Company established its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP within the meaning of Internal Revenue
Code Section 4975(e)(7) and invests solely in common stock of the Company. 

Upon establishment of the ESOP, Nodak Insurance loaned to the
ESOP s related trust (the ESOP Trust ). The ESOP loan was for a period of , bearing interest at the long-term
Applicable Federal Rate effective on the closing date of the offering annually). The ESOP Trust used the proceeds of the loan to
purchase shares in our IPO, which resulted in the ESOP Trust owning approximately of the Company s authorized shares. The ESOP
has purchased the shares for investment and not for resale. 

The shares purchased by the ESOP Trust in the offering are held in
a suspense account as collateral for the ESOP loan. Nodak Insurance makes semi-annual cash contributions to the ESOP in amounts no smaller
than the amounts required for the ESOP Trust to make its loan payments to Nodak Insurance. While the ESOP makes two loan payments per
year, a pre-determined portion of the shares are released from the suspense account and allocated to participant accounts at the end of
the calendar year. This release and allocation occurs on an annual basis over the ten-year term of the ESOP loan. Nodak Insurance has
a lien on the shares of common stock of the Company held by the ESOP to secure repayment of the loan from the ESOP to Nodak Insurance.
If the ESOP is terminated as a result of a change in control of the Company, the ESOP may be required to pay the costs of terminating
the plan. 

It is anticipated that the only assets held by the ESOP will be shares
of the Company s common stock. Participants in the ESOP cannot direct the investment of any assets allocated to their accounts.
The ESOP participants are employees of Nodak Insurance. The employees of Primero, Direct Auto, and Westminster do not participate in the
ESOP. 

Each employee of Nodak Insurance automatically becomes a participant
in the ESOP if such employee is at least 21 years old, has completed a minimum of one thousand hours of service with Nodak Insurance,
and has completed an Eligibility Computation Period. Employees are not permitted to make any contributions to the ESOP. Participants in
the ESOP receive annual reports from the Company showing the number of shares of common stock of the Company allocated to the participants 
accounts and the market value of those shares. The shares are allocated to participants based on compensation as provided for in the ESOP. 

In connection with the establishment of the ESOP, the Company created
a contra-equity account on the Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the ESOP s basis in the shares. The basis of those shares was
set at per share as part of the IPO. As shares are released from the ESOP suspense account, the contra-equity account is credited,
which reduces the impact of the contra-equity account on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets over time. The Company records
compensation expense related to the shares released, equal to the number of shares released from the suspense account multiplied by the
average market value of the Company s stock during the period. 

The Company recognized compensation expense related to the ESOP of
 and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Through September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had
released and allocated ESOP shares to participants, with a remainder of ESOP shares in suspense at September 30, 2024,
and December 31, 2023. Using the Company s quarter-end market price of per share, the fair value of the unearned ESOP shares
was at September 30, 2024.

Effective for the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Company adopted the updated guidance for leases. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of
the 2023 Annual Report for additional information. We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract.
A contract will be deemed to be or contain a lease if the contract conveys the right to control and directs the use of identified property
or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. We generally must also have the right to obtain substantially all of
the economic benefits from the use of the property and equipment. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid,
we estimate incremental borrowing rates based on the floating interest rate on our Line of Credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. at the lease
commencement date, as rates are not implicitly stated in most leases. Lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities
and right-of-use assets are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

There were expenses of and related to these
leases during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months ended September

Shares outstanding, end of period 

The changes in the number of common shares outstanding excludes certain
non-forfeitable stock award shares that are included in the weighted average common shares outstanding used in basic earnings per common
share calculations. The net loss per diluted common share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, excluded the
weighted average effects of and shares, respectively, of stock awards since the impacts of these potential shares of common
stock were anti-dilutive. The net loss per diluted common share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, excluded the weighted
average effects of shares of stock awards since the impacts of these potential shares of common stock were anti-dilutive. 

On May 9, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an
authorization for the repurchase of up to approximately of the Company s outstanding common stock. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased
 shares of our common stock for , under our share repurchase authorization. Included in the cost of treasury stock acquired

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs
for RSUs based on the grant date fair value. The compensation costs are normally expensed over the vesting periods to each vesting date;
however, the cost of RSUs granted to executives are expensed immediately if the executive has met certain retirement criteria and the
RSUs become non-forfeitable. Estimated forfeitures are included in the determination of compensation costs. No forfeitures are currently

Performance Share Units 

The Compensation Committee has awarded PSUs to select
executives. PSUs are promises to issue actual shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, if certain performance conditions
are met. The PSUs granted to employees under the Plan are based on salary and, prior to 2024, include a three-year adjusted book value
cumulative growth target with threshold and stretch goals. Effective for grants made in 2024, the performance metric is calculated based
on an adjusted return on equity over a three-year period, with annual resets. They will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date,
subject to the participant s continuous employment through the vesting date and the level of performance achieved. Dividend equivalents
on PSUs are accrued and paid in cash at the end of the performance period in accordance with the level of performance achieved but are
subject to forfeiture until the underlying shares become vested. Participants do not have voting rights with respect to PSUs. 

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs
for PSUs based on the grant date fair value over the performance period of the awards. Estimated forfeitures are included in the determination
of compensation costs. The current cost estimates represent the Company s forecasted performance against cumulative growth targets.

The cost estimates for PSU grants represent initial

of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period will range from to of the initial target awards. As of December 31,
2023, the previously recognized compensation expense related to the PSU awards granted during 2022 and 2021 was eliminated due to the
Company's expectation that the threshold performance goal will not be met. 

At September 30, 2024, there was of unrecognized

reportable operating segments of our
continuing operations, which consist of Private Passenger Auto, Non-Standard Auto, Home and Farm, Crop, and All Other (which primarily
consists of commercial, assumed reinsurance, and our excess liability business). Prior to the sale of Westminster on June 30, 2024, we
also reported a Commercial segment that consisted primarily of Westminster s balances and results. Subsequent to the sale, Westminster
is reported as part of discontinued operations, which is not included in our segment information. The commercial business that remains
a part of our continuing operations has been included in the All Other segment for the current and prior periods presented. We operate
only in the U.S., and no single customer or agent provides 10 percent or more of our revenues. The following tables provide available
information of these segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

For purposes of evaluating profitability of the Non-Standard
Auto segment, we combine the policy fees paid by the insured with the underwriting gain or loss as its primary measure. As a result, these
fees are allocated to the Non-Standard Auto segment (included in fee and other income) in the tables below. The remaining fee and other
income amounts are not allocated to any segment. 

We do not assign or allocate all line items in our
Consolidated Statement of Operations or Consolidated Balance Sheets to our operating segments. Those line items include net investment
income, net investment gains, fee and other income excluding Non-Standard Auto, and income tax expense (benefit) within the Unaudited
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Below are comments regarding net premiums earned by business segment: 

Private Passenger Auto Net premiums earned for
the third quarter of 2024 increased 1,377, or 6.5 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned for the first nine months
of 2024 increased 5,754, or 9.4 from the first nine months of 2023. Results were driven by new business growth in North Dakota as well
as significant rate increases in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska, partially offset by lower new business and retention levels
in South Dakota and Nebraska as a result of underwriting actions taken to improve profitability. 

Non-Standard Auto Net premiums earned for the
third quarter of 2024 increased 1,770, or 8.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned for the first nine months of
2024 increased 10,979, or 17.2 from the first nine months of 2023. Results were driven by prior period new business growth in Illinois
and Arizona as well as significant rate increases in the Chicago market where our non-standard auto business is concentrated, partially
offset by lower retention compared to prior year periods. 

Home and Farm Net premiums earned for the third
quarter of 2024 increased 2,170, or 10.2 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned for the first nine months of 2024
increased 5,103, or 8.3 from the first nine months of 2023. Results were driven by new business growth in North Dakota, rate increases,
and increased insured property values, which were primarily the result of higher inflationary factors. These increases were partially
offset by lower retention rates and new business levels in Nebraska and South Dakota as a result of underwriting actions taken to improve
profitability. 

Crop Net premiums earned for the third quarter
of 2024, increased 1,139, or 11.7 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned for the first nine months of 2024 decreased
 2,043, or 9.1 from the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the recognition during the
prior year quarter of a reduction in the acres insured for the prior year. The year-to-date decrease was driven by lower commodity prices
in the current year. 

All Other Net premiums earned for the third quarter
of 2024, increased 396, or 13.7 , compared to the same period in 2023. Net premiums earned for the first nine months of 2024 increased
 406, or 4.6 , from the first nine months of 2023. Results were driven by rate and insured value increases for the commercial and excess
lines of business, partially offset by the continued run-off of our participation in an assumed domestic and international reinsurance
pool of business.

Below are comments regarding significant changes in the net losses
and loss adjustment expenses, and the net loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, by business segment: 

Private Passenger Auto The net loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio decreased 16.0 percentage points and 15.8 percentage points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by improved loss frequency
in Nebraska and South Dakota during the current year quarter. The year-to-date decrease was driven by the improved loss frequency in the
current year quarter as well as lower levels of weather-related losses in the current year due to the mild winter in the Midwest compared
to elevated winter weather-related losses in the prior year. Both periods were positively affected by earned premium growth. 

Non-Standard Auto The net loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio increased 0.4 percentage points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.
Although the year-over-year ratios were relatively consistent, the current year quarter was impacted by unfavorable prior year reserve
development related to elevated bodily injury losses. The net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio decreased 2.6 percentage points in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by earned premium
growth resulting from new business growth and significant rate increases. 

Home and Farm The net loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio increased 27.9 percentage points and 18.3 percentage points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases in net loss and loss adjustment expense ratios were driven by higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses in North Dakota and Nebraska during 2024 compared to the prior year partially offset by earned
premium growth in the current year. 

Crop The net loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio increased 19.0 percentage points and 9.0 percentage points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases were driven by slightly less favorable crop growing conditions compared to the prior
year. 

All Other The net loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio increased 71.1 percentage points and 31.8 percentage points in the three- and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared
to the same period in 2023. These increases were driven by elevated large loss experience compared to the prior year. The negative loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio for the third quarter of 2023 was the result of an inter-segment reclassification of a large loss during
the quarter.

Expense Ratio

 32.5 

The expense ratio is calculated by dividing other underwriting and
general expenses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs by net premiums earned. The expense ratio measures a company s
operational efficiency in producing, underwriting, and administering its insurance business. The overall expense ratio increased 1.6 percentage
points and 1.2 percentage points in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2023. The increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is due to higher deferrable costs resulting from significant
premium growth compared to the prior year, including significant growth in the Non-Standard Auto segment which generally pays higher agent
commissions than our other segments. The increase in the other underwriting and general expenses is due to the costs incurred in the current
quarter associated with the execution of the separation agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer.

Underwriting gain (loss) measures the pre-tax profitability of our
insurance operations. It is derived by subtracting losses and loss adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs,
and other underwriting and general expenses from net premiums earned. The combined ratio represents the sum of these losses and expenses
as a percentage of net premiums earned and measures our overall underwriting profit. 

The total underwriting loss increased 8,578 for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The total underwriting loss increased 9,508 for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These results were driven by the factors discussed in the Loss and Loss
Adjustment Expenses as well as the Underwriting and General Expenses and Expense Ratio sections above. 

The overall combined ratio increased 10.2 percentage points in the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The overall combined ratio increased 3.7 percentage
points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These results were driven by the factors
discussed in the Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses as well as the Underwriting and General Expenses and Expense Ratio sections above. 

Fee and Other Income 

We had fee and other income of 491 and 1,590 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 445 and 1,196 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
Fee income is largely attributable to the Non-Standard Auto segment and is a key component in measuring its profitability. Fee and other
income on this business increased to 281 and 971 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 278 and
 748 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in this segment.

Net investment income increased 690 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net investment income increased 2,354 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily driven by the higher interest rate environment
which resulted in higher reinvestment rates in our fixed income portfolio. 

Gross and net return on average cash and invested assets increased
year-over-year, primarily driven by the favorable interest rate environment that resulted in significantly higher net investment income
on an increased average balance of fixed income securities as well as cash and cash equivalents (measured at fair value). In addition,
the increase in investments in high dividend yield equities resulted in relatively consistent year-over-year dividend income despite a
reduction in the average equities balance (measured at fair value). The increase in average cash and invested assets was driven by changes
in the fair value of fixed income securities due to the interest rate environment as well as higher operating cash flows during the first
nine months of 2024. 

Net Investment Gains (Losses) 

Net investment gains (losses) consisted of the following:

We had net realized gains of 45 and losses of 37 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net realized gains of 509 and 12,046 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. The elevated net realized gains in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were the result of a strategic
liquidation of a portfolio of equity securities. The gross realized gains from the sale of these securities were largely offset by the
elimination of the unrealized gain position of these securities. No credit impairment losses were reported during any of the periods presented. 

We experienced an increase of 2,367 and 3,325 in net unrealized gains
on equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, attributable to overall favorable equity
markets during the current quarter and year-to-date. We experienced a decrease in net unrealized gains on equity securities of 1,464
and 11,771 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in unrealized gains on equity securities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by the equity portfolio liquidation noted above and the impact of changes
in fair value attributable to equity market volatility. 

Our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale because
we will, from time to time, make sales of securities that are not impaired, consistent with our investment goals and policies. The fixed
income portion of the portfolio experienced net unrealized gains of 11,138 and 8,848 during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, compared to net unrealized losses of 8,718 and 5,741 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. The changes were primarily the result of changes in U.S. interest rates. The change in the fair value of fixed income securities
is not reflected in net income; rather it is reflected as a separate component (net of income taxes) of other comprehensive income. 

Income (Loss) before Income Taxes 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a pre-tax loss
of 3,456 compared to a pre-tax income of 1,019 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change was largely
attributable to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses for Home and Farm in the states of North Dakota and Nebraska, unfavorable
prior year loss reserve development for Non-Standard Auto, and expenses incurred related to the separation agreement with our former Chief
Executive Officer, partially offset by net earned premium growth, improved loss experience for Private Passenger Auto, and higher net
investment income. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a pre-tax loss
of 3,693 compared to pre-tax income of 54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change was largely attributable
to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses for Home and Farm in the states of North Dakota and Nebraska, unfavorable prior year
loss reserve development for Non-Standard Auto, and expenses incurred related to the separation agreement with our former Chief Executive
Officer, partially offset by net earned premium growth, improved loss experience for Private Passenger Auto, and higher net investment
income.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 

We recorded an income tax benefit of 751 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax expense of 214 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for
the third quarter of 2024 was 21.7 compared to an effective tax rate of 21.0 for the third quarter of 2023. 

We recorded an income tax benefit of 445 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the
first nine months of 2024 (excluding tax effects related to the loss on the sale of Westminster) was 12.0 compared to an effective tax
rate of 20.4 for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was impacted by a 346 valuation
allowance on net operating loss carryforwards established as a result of the Battle Creek demutualization. 

Net Income (Loss) 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss before
non-controlling interest of 2,705 compared to net income of 805 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change
was largely attributable to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses for Home and Farm in the states of North Dakota and Nebraska,
unfavorable prior year loss reserve development for Non-Standard Auto, and expenses incurred related to the separation agreement with
our former Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by net earned premium growth, improved loss experience for Private Passenger Auto,
and higher net investment income. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss before
non-controlling interest of 3,248 compared to net income of 43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change
was largely attributable to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses for Home and Farm in the states of North Dakota and Nebraska,
unfavorable prior year loss reserve development for Non-Standard Auto, and expenses incurred related to the separation agreement with
our former Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by net earned premium growth, improved loss experience for Private Passenger Auto,
and higher net investment income. 

Return on Average Equity 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had annualized return
on average equity, after non-controlling interest, of (4.5) compared to annualized return on average equity, after non-controlling interest,
of 1.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had annualized return
on average equity, after non-controlling interest, of (1.9) compared to annualized return on average equity, after non-controlling interest,
of 0.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Average equity is calculated as the average between beginning and ending
equity, excluding non-controlling interest, for the period.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires
both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies. We are required to make estimates
and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes.
We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends,
and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform
to these estimates and assumptions or that reported results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected by the need to
make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. Our critical accounting policies
are more fully described in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
presented in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies from December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We expect to generate sufficient funds from our operations and maintain
a high degree of liquidity in our investment portfolio to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses for the foreseeable
future. Our primary sources of funds are premium collections, investment earnings, and fixed income maturities. 

The change in cash and cash equivalents for continuing and discontinued
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 
 2023 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities 
 16,780 
 9,458 
 
 Net cash flows from investing activities 
 5,327 
 (2,021 
 
 Net cash flows from financing activities 
 (3,613 
 (7,454 
 
 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 
 18,494 
 (17 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by
operating activities totaled 16,780 compared to 9,458 a year ago. This change was primarily driven by lower levels of loss and loss
adjustment payments in the current year partially offset by higher levels of tax payments (net of refunds) in the current year. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by
investing activities totaled 5,327 compared to net cash used of 2,021 a year ago. This change was primarily attributable to the proceeds
from the sale of Westminster in the current year partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows for investment activities in the
current year. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by financing
activities totaled 3,613 compared to 7,454 a year ago. This decrease in cash used was attributable to a reduction in share repurchases
in the current year partially offset by the final pooling settlement between Nodak Insurance and Westminster. 

As a holding company, a principal source of long-term liquidity will
be dividend payments from our directly-owned subsidiaries. 

52 

Nodak Insurance is restricted by the insurance laws of North Dakota
as to the amount of dividends or other distributions it may pay to NI Holdings. North Dakota law sets the maximum amount of dividends
that may be paid by Nodak Insurance during any twelve-month period after notice to, but without prior approval of, the North Dakota Insurance
Department. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 10 of the Company s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding
December 31, or (ii) the Company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year (excluding realized investment gains), less
any prior dividends paid during such twelve-month period. In addition, any insurance company other than a life insurance company may carry
forward net income from the preceding two calendar years, not including realized investment gains, less any dividends actually paid during
those two calendar years. Dividends in excess of this amount are considered extraordinary and are subject to the approval
of the North Dakota Insurance Department. 

There is no amount available for payment of dividends from Nodak Insurance
to NI Holdings during 2024 without the prior approval of the North Dakota Insurance Department. Prior to its payment of any dividend,
Nodak Insurance will be required to provide notice of the dividend to the North Dakota Insurance Department. This notice must be provided
to the North Dakota Insurance Department 30 days prior to the payment of an extraordinary dividend and 10 days prior to the payment of
an ordinary dividend. The North Dakota Insurance Department has the power to limit or prohibit dividend payments if an insurance company
is in violation of any law or regulation. These restrictions or any subsequently imposed restrictions may affect our future liquidity.
No dividends were declared or paid by Nodak Insurance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31,
2023. 

Direct Auto re-domesticated from Illinois to North Dakota during 2021
and is now subject to the same dividend restrictions as Nodak Insurance. The amount available for payment of dividends from Direct Auto
to NI Holdings during 2024 without the prior approval of the North Dakota Insurance Department is approximately 90 as of December 31,
2023. No dividends were declared or paid by Direct Auto during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31,
2023. 

Westminster re-domesticated from Maryland to North Dakota during 2021
and was subject to the same dividend restrictions as Nodak Insurance. Westminster was sold on June 30, 2024. No dividends were declared
or paid by Westminster to NI Holdings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023. For additional
information see Part I, Item 1, Note 19 Discontinued Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

53 

Item 3. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

The Company s assessment of market risk as of September 30, 2024,
indicates there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Item 4. - Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures DCPs ),
as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. As a result of
the material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting ("ICFR") discussed below, the Interim Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s DCPs, as of the end of the period covered by this
report, were not effective in ensuring information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such material information
is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within a company have been detected. 

Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in ICFR, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for
the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over its accounting for intercompany reinsurance
pooling activity. Specifically, it lacked an effectively designed internal control related to the evaluation of pooling payable/receivable
balances, including when a pool member is sold. This material weakness resulted in a material error and the restatement of the Company's
consolidated financial statements for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, this material weakness could
result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

Remediation Plan for Material Weakness 

Upon identification of the material weakness, management developed
a remediation plan, which included designing and implementing a new quarterly intercompany pooling reconciliation and review process
to fully evaluate pooling payable/receivable balances in support of financial reporting for GAAP purposes. The material weakness will
not be considered remediated until the remediation plan has been implemented and there has been sufficient time for the Company to conclude
through testing that the controls are operating effectively. As the Company's management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee,
continues to evaluate and improve the Company's ICFR, management may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies
or determine to modify, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures identified. We can offer
no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In the ordinary course of business, we periodically review our system
of internal control over financial reporting to identify opportunities to improve our controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring
that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Except for the identified material weakness above, there have not been any
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Part
II. - 
OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. - Legal Proceedings 

We are, from time to time, party to routine litigation incidental to
the normal course of our business. Based upon information presently available to us, we do not consider any litigation to be material.
However, given the uncertainties attendant to litigation, we cannot assure you that our results of operations and financial condition
will not be materially adversely affected by any litigation. 

Item 1A. - Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes in our assessment of our risk
factors from those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. 

55 

Item 2. - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

All dollar amounts included in Item 2 herein, except per share data,
are in thousands. 

The Company has not sold any unregistered securities within the past
three years. 

On January 17, 2017, our registration statement on Form S-1 registering
our common stock was declared effective by the SEC. On March 13, 2017, the Company completed the IPO of 10,350,000 shares of common stock
at a price of 10.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of 93,145 from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts
and offering expenses. 

From time to time, the Company may also repurchase its own stock. To
date, the Company has used the net proceeds from the IPO to fund these share repurchases. 

There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from
our IPO as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on January 17, 2017. 

On May 9, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an authorization for
the repurchase of up to approximately 10,000 of the Company s outstanding common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
we completed the repurchase of 54,223 shares of our common stock for 734 under this authorization. During the year ended December 31,
2023, we repurchased an additional 548,549 shares of our common stock for 7,278, including the effect from applicable excise taxes. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. At September 30, 2024, 2,052 remains
available under this authorization.
