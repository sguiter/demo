 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this report, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words "expect," "anticipate," "aims," "intend," "may," "should," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but other statements not based on historical information may also be considered forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the statements, including, but not limited to: (i) deterioration in the financial condition of borrowers of Pinnacle Bank and its subsidiaries or BHG, including as a result of persistent elevated interest rates, the negative impact of inflationary pressures and challenging economic conditions on our and BHG's customers and their businesses, resulting in significant increases in loan losses and provisions for those losses and, in the case of BHG, substitutions; (ii) fluctuations or differences in interest rates on loans or deposits from those that Pinnacle Financial is modeling or anticipating, including as a result of Pinnacle Bank's inability to better match deposit rates with the changes in the short-term rate environment, or that affect the yield curve; (iii) the sale of investment securities in a loss position before their value recovers, including as a result of asset liability management strategies or in response to liquidity needs; (iv) adverse conditions in the national or local economies including in Pinnacle Financial's markets throughout the Southeast region of the United States, particularly in commercial and residential real estate markets; (v) the inability of Pinnacle Financial, or entities in which it has significant investments, like BHG, to maintain the long-term historical growth rate of its, or such entities', loan portfolio; (vi) the ability to grow and retain low-cost core deposits and retain large, uninsured deposits, including during times when Pinnacle Bank is seeking to limit the rates it pays on deposits or uncertainty exists in the financial services sector; (vii) changes in loan underwriting, credit review or loss reserve policies associated with economic conditions, examination conclusions, or regulatory developments; (viii) effectiveness of Pinnacle Financial's asset management activities in improving, resolving or liquidating lower-quality assets; (ix) the impact of competition with other financial institutions, including pricing pressures and the resulting impact on Pinnacle Financial s results, including as a result of the negative impact to net interest margin from elevated deposit and other funding costs; (x) the results of regulatory examinations of Pinnacle Financial, Pinnacle Bank or BHG, or companies with whom they do business; (xi) BHG's ability to profitably grow its business and successfully execute on its business plans; (xii) risks of expansion into new geographic or product markets; (xiii) any matter that would cause Pinnacle Financial to conclude that there was impairment of any asset, including goodwill or other intangible assets; (xiv) the ineffectiveness of Pinnacle Bank's hedging strategies, or the unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure of the underlying hedges; (xv) reduced ability to attract additional financial advisors (or failure of such advisors to cause their clients to switch to Pinnacle Bank), to retain financial advisors (including as a result of the competitive environment for associates) or otherwise to attract customers from other financial institutions; (xvi) deterioration in the valuation of other real estate owned and increased expenses associated therewith; (xvii) inability to comply with regulatory capital requirements, including those resulting from changes to capital calculation methodologies, required capital maintenance levels or regulatory requests or directives, particularly if Pinnacle Bank's level of applicable commercial real estate loans were to exceed percentage levels of total capital in guidelines recommended by its regulators; (xviii) approval of the declaration of any dividend by Pinnacle Financial's board of directors; (xix) the vulnerability of Pinnacle Bank's network and online banking portals, and the systems of parties with whom Pinnacle Bank contracts, to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches; (xx) the possibility of increased compliance and operational costs as a result of increased regulatory oversight (including by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), including oversight of companies in which Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank have significant investments, like BHG, and the development of additional banking products for Pinnacle Bank's corporate and consumer clients; (xxi) Pinnacle Financial's ability to identify potential candidates for, consummate, and achieve synergies from, potential future acquisitions; (xxii) difficulties and delays in integrating acquired businesses or fully realizing costs savings and other benefits from acquisitions; (xxiii) the risks associated with Pinnacle Bank being a minority investor in BHG, including the risk that the owners of a majority of the equity interests in BHG decide to sell the company or all or a portion of their ownership interests in BHG (triggering a similar sale by Pinnacle Bank); (xxiv) changes in state and federal legislation, regulations or policies applicable to banks and other financial service providers, like BHG, including regulatory or legislative developments; (xxv) fluctuations in the valuations of Pinnacle Financial's equity investments and the ultimate success of such investments; (xxvi) the availability of and access to capital; (xxvii) adverse results (including costs, fines, reputational harm, inability to obtain necessary approvals and/or other negative effects) from current or future litigation, regulatory examinations or other legal and/or regulatory actions involving Pinnacle Financial, Pinnacle Bank or BHG; and (xxviii) general competitive, economic, political and market conditions. Additional factors which could affect the forward looking statements included in this report can be found in Pinnacle Financial's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC and available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.

interest in Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC (BHG), a company that primarily serves as a full-service commercial loan provider to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals for business purposes but also makes consumer loans for various purposes. Pinnacle Bank provides a full range of banking services, including investment, mortgage, insurance, and comprehensive wealth management services, in several primarily urban markets and their surrounding communities. 

million related to a commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Upon the sale of these commercial loans, the rights to service loans (MSRs) are capitalized and represent the fair value of future net servicing fees from servicing activities associated with these commercial mortgage loans. Pinnacle Financial has elected to account for this class of MSRs under the fair value measurement method. Under this method, capitalized MSRs are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with changes in the fair value of the MSRs for each period presented recorded in other noninterest income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. 
 
 MSRs are recorded at fair value utilizing a number of assumptions, including prepayment speeds, interest rates, discount rates and other economic factors. Changes in the underlying assumptions could materially affect the fair value of MSRs. The value of servicing rights is initially measured using a discounted cash flow model. All servicing rights capitalized have involved the retention of servicing rights only; Pinnacle Financial does not retain residual interest, "first loss" obligations, or other similar on-going financial interests in the loans it sells to third parties, nor has Pinnacle Financial participated in any securitizations with any special purpose entities with respect to these MSRs. 
 
 Except for recovery of amounts invested in acquiring servicing rights, servicing mortgage loans for others does not generally impose significant financial risks to the servicer. There are, however, certain investors for whom servicing does involve some risk of loss. For example, servicing Federal Housing Administration insured or Veterans Administration guaranteed loans can result in the

 During the quarters ended March 31, 2022, March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2018, Pinnacle Financial transferred, at fair value, billion, million and million, respectively, of securities from the available-for-sale portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio. The related net unrealized after tax losses of million, net unrealized after tax gains of million and net unrealized after tax losses of million, respectively, on these transferred securities remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are being amortized over the remaining life of the transferred securities, offsetting the related amortization of discount or premium on the transferred securities. No gains or losses were recognized at the time of the transfer. At September 30, 2024, approximately billion of securities within Pinnacle Financial's investment portfolio were pledged to secure either public funds and other deposits or securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At September 30, 2024, repurchase agreements comprised of secured borrowings totaled million and were secured by million of pledged U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, asset-backed securities and corporate notes. As the fair value of securities pledged to secure repurchase agreements may decline, Pinnacle Financial regularly evaluates its need to pledge additional securities to the customers with whom it has entered into the repurchase agreements for the customers to remain adequately secured.

 The applicable dates for determining when available-for-sale securities were in an unrealized loss position were September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As such, it is possible that an available-for-sale security had a market value less than its amortized cost on other days during the twelve-month pe riods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, but is not included in the "Investments with an Unrealized Loss of less t han 12 months" category above. 
 
 As shown in the tables above, at September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Financial had approximately million in unrealized losses on approximately billion of available-for-sale securities. For any securities classified as available-for-sale that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date, Pinnacle Financial assesses whether or not it intends to sell the security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security, before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a write-down to fair value through net income. Because Pinnacle Financial currently does not intend to sell those available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024, and it is not more-likely-than-not that Pinnacle Financial will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Pinnacle Financial has determined that no write-down is necessary. In addition, Pinnacle Financial evaluates whether any portion of the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities is the result of credit deterioration, which would require the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. Such evaluations consider the extent to which the amortized cost of the security exceeds its fair value, changes in credit ratings and any other known adverse conditions related to the specific security. The unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024 are driven by changes in interest rates and are not due to the credit quality of the securities, and accordingly, no allowance for credit losses is considered necessary related to available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024. These securities will continue to be monitored as a part of Pinnacle Financial's ongoing evaluation of credit quality. Management evaluates the financial performance of the issuers on a quarterly basis to determine if it is probable that the issuers can make all contractual principal and interest payments. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities is measured on a collective basis by major security type. Pinnacle Financial has a zero loss expectation for U.S. treasury securities in addition to U.S. Government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and accordingly, no allowance for credit losses is estimated for these securities. Credit losses on held-to-maturity state and municipal securities and corporate notes and other securities are estimated using third-party probability of default and loss given default models driven primarily by macroeconomic factors over a reasonable and supportable period of twenty-four months with an eight month reversion to average loss factors. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated allowance for credit losses on these held-to-maturity securities was million.

 such securities were sold during three months ended September 30, 2024. During nine months ended September 30, 2024, million of available-for-sale securities were sold resulting in gross realized gains of and gross realized losses of million.

 Pinnacle Financial has entered into various fair value hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of changing interest rates on the fair values of available-for-sale securities. See Note 9. Derivative Instruments for disclosure of the gains and losses recognized on derivative instruments and the cumulative fair value hedging adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged securities.

Risk ratings are categorized as pass, special mention, substandard, substandard-nonaccrual or doubtful-nonaccrual. Each of the risk rating categories is further described below. Pass rated loans include multiple ratings categories representing varying degrees of risk attributes that are less than those of the other defined risk categories further described below. Pinnacle Financial believes its categories follow those used by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators. At September 30, 2024, approximately of Pinnacle Financial's loan portfolio was analyzed as a commercial loan type with a specifically assigned risk rating. Consumer loans and small business loans are generally not assigned an individual risk rating but are evaluated as either accrual or nonaccrual based on the performance of the individual loans. However, certain consumer real estate-mortgage loans and certain consumer and other loans receive a specific risk rating due to the loan proceeds being used for commercial purposes even though the collateral may be of a consumer loan nature. Consumer loans that have been placed on nonaccrual but have not otherwise been assigned a risk rating are believed by management to share risk characteristics with loans rated substandard-nonaccrual and have been presented as such in Pinnacle Financial's risk rating disclosures. 
 
 Risk ratings are subject to continual review by a financial advisor and a senior credit officer. At least annually, Pinnacle Financial's credit procedures require that every risk rated loan of million or more be subject to a formal credit risk review process. Each loan's risk rating is also subject to review by Pinnacle Financial's independent loan review department, which reviews a substantial portion of Pinnacle Financial's risk rated portfolio annually. Included in the coverage are independent reviews of loans in targeted higher-risk portfolio segments such as certain commercial and industrial loans, land loans and/or loan types in certain geographies. 
 
 Following are the definitions of the risk rating categories used by Pinnacle Financial. Pass rated loans include all credits other than those included within these categories: 
 
 Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in Pinnacle Financial's credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and financial capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize collection of the debt. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that Pinnacle Financial could sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Substandard-nonaccrual loans are substandard loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Doubtful-nonaccrual loans have all the characteristics of substandard-nonaccrual loans with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

 The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by Pinnacle Financial's management on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The level of the allowance for credit losses maintained by management is believed to be adequate to absorb all expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. 
 
 The current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology requires the allowance for credit losses to be measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. For commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, and commercial and industrial loans, Pinnacle Financial primarily utilizes a probability of default and loss given default modeling approach. These models utilize historical correlations between default and loss experience, loan level attributes, and certain macroeconomic factors as determined through a statistical regression analysis. Segments using this approach incorporate various economic drivers. 
 
 Commercial and industrial loans consider gross domestic product (GDP), the consumer credit index and the national unemployment rate, commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans including nonowner occupied and owner occupied commercial real estate loans consider the national unemployment rate and the commercial property and commercial real estate price indices, construction and land development loans consider the commercial property, consumer credit and home price indices dependent upon their use as residential versus commercial, consumer real estate loans consider the home price index and household debt ratio and other consumer loans consider the national unemployment rate and the household financial obligations ratio.

 The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Pinnacle Financial uses a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, a loan modification will be granted by providing principal forgiveness on certain loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is charged-off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses.

 Among other data, Pinnacle Financial monitors two ratios regarding construction and commercial real estate lending as part of its concentration management processes. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Bank s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were and , respectively. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans (including construction and land development loans) as a percentage of total risk-based capital were and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100 of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300 of total risk-based capital. When a bank s ratios are in excess of one or both of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank was within the 100 and 300 guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate monitoring of its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans below the 100 and 300 thresholds.

 These residential mortgage loans held-for-sale are originated internally and are primarily to borrowers in Pinnacle Bank's geographic markets. These sales are typically on a mandatory basis to investors that follow conventional government sponsored entities and the Department of Housing and Urban Development/U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines. 
 
 Each purchaser of a residential mortgage loan held-for-sale has specific guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans and the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold is generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the loans are sold without recourse, the purchase agreements require Pinnacle Bank to make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and sufficiency of file documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. If it is determined that the loans sold were in breach of these representations or warranties, Pinnacle Bank has obligations to either repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of the loan. To date, Pinnacle Bank's liability pursuant to the terms of these representations and warranties has been insignificant. 

million related to a commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Upon the sale of these commercial loans, the rights to service loans (MSRs) are capitalized and represent the fair value of future net servicing fees from servicing activities associated with these commercial mortgage loans. Pinnacle Financial has elected to account for this class of MSRs under the fair value measurement method. Pinnacle Financial recognizes MSRs upon the sale of commercial mortgage loans to external third parties when it retains the obligation to service the loans. MSRs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets with any subsequent changes in fair value being recognized in other noninterest income. The MSR asset fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which incorporates key assumptions such as, prepayment speeds, interest rates, discount rates, and other economic factors.

The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal and state income tax statutory rate of at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is primarily due to investments in bank qualified municipal securities, tax benefits of Pinnacle Bank's real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in the Tennessee Community Investment Tax Credit program, and tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and bank-owned life insurance, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. 
 
 Income tax expense is also impacted by the vesting of equity-based awards and the exercise of employee stock options, which as expense or benefit is recorded as a discrete item as a component of total income tax, the amount of which is dependent upon the change in the grant date fair value and the vest date fair value of the underlying award.

 Standby letters of credit are generally issued on behalf of an applicant (customer) to a specifically named beneficiary and are the result of a particular business arrangement that exists between the applicant and the beneficiary. Standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and are usually for terms of or less unless terminated beforehand due to criteria specified in the standby letter of credit. A typical arrangement involves the applicant routinely being indebted to the beneficiary for such items as inventory purchases, insurance, utilities, lease guarantees or other third party commercial transactions. The standby letter of credit would permit the beneficiary to obtain payment from Pinnacle Financial under certain prescribed circumstances. Subsequently, Pinnacle Financial would then seek reimbursement from the applicant pursuant to the terms of the standby letter of credit.

 Pinnacle Financial typically follows the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is typically evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include cash, real estate and improvements, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and personal property.

The valuation of MSRs uses assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value, including prepayment speeds, interest rates, discount rates and other economic factors, which are considered significant unobservable inputs. Due to the nature of the inputs used in the valuation, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Other assets Included in other assets are certain assets carried at fair value, including interest rate swap agreements to facilitate customer transactions, interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, interest rate caps and floors designated as cash flow hedges and interest rate locks associated with the mortgage loan pipeline. The carrying amount of interest rate swap agreements is based on Pinnacle Financial's pricing models that utilize observable market inputs. The fair value of the cash flow hedge agreements is determined by calculating the difference between the discounted fixed rate cash flows and the discounted variable rate cash flows. The fair value of the mortgage loan pipeline is based upon the projected sales price of the underlying loans, taking into account market interest rates and other market factors at the measurement date, net of the projected fallout rate. Pinnacle Financial reflects these assets within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as these assets are valued using similar transactions that occur in the market. 
 
 Collateral dependent loans Collateral dependent loans are measured at the fair value of the collateral securing the loan less estimated selling costs. The fair value of real estate collateral is determined based on real estate appraisals which are generally based on recent sales of comparable properties which are then adjusted for property specific factors. Non-real estate collateral is valued based on various sources, including third party asset valuations and internally determined values based on cost adjusted for depreciation and other judgmentally determined discount factors. Collateral dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy due to the unobservable inputs used in determining their fair value such as collateral values and the borrower's underlying financial condition. 
 
 Other real estate owned Other real estate owned (OREO) represents real estate foreclosed upon by Pinnacle Bank through loan defaults by customers or acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure. Upon foreclosure, the property is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, based on appraised value, less selling costs estimated as of the date acquired with any loss recognized as a charge-off through

 In the case of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio (AFS), Pinnacle Financial monitors the portfolio to ascertain when transfers between levels have been affected. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, AFS security with a carrying value of million previously classified as Level 2 was transferred to Level 3 due to unobservable inputs becoming significant. The nature of the remaining assets and liabilities is such that transfers in and out of any level are expected to be rare. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3.

 . Additionally, approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of Pinnacle Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. Under Tennessee corporate law, Pinnacle Financial is not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if it were dissolving. In deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, Pinnacle Financial's board of directors must consider its and Pinnacle Bank's current and prospective capital, liquidity and other needs. In addition to state law limitations on Pinnacle Financial's ability to pay dividends, the Federal Reserve imposes limitations on Pinnacle Financial's ability to pay dividends. Federal Reserve regulations limit dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if Pinnacle Financial's regulatory capital is below the level of regulatory minimums plus the applicable 2.5 capital conservation buffer. 
 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued supervisory guidance advising bank holding companies to eliminate, defer or reduce dividends paid on common stock and other forms of Tier 1 capital where the company s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, the company s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition or the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Recent supplements to this guidance reiterate the need for bank holding companies to inform their applicable reserve bank sufficiently in advance of the proposed payment of a dividend in certain circumstances. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank paid million of dividends to Pinnacle Financial. As of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria noted above Pinnacle Bank could pay approximately billion of additional dividends to Pinnacle Financial without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI. Since the fourth quarter of 2013, Pinnacle Financial has paid a quarterly common stock dividend. The board of directors of Pinnacle Financial has increased the dividend amount per share over time. The most recent increase occurred on January 18, 2022 when the board of directors increased the dividend to per common share from per common share. During the second quarter of 2020, Pinnacle Financial issued million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th fractional interest in a share of Series B noncumulative, perpetual preferred stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, Pinnacle Financial began paying a quarterly dividend of per share (or per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments by Pinnacle Financial, if any, including dividends on Pinnacle Financial's Series B Preferred Stock (and associated depositary shares), is subject to discretion of Pinnacle Financial's board of directors and will depend on Pinnacle Financial's receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, earnings, capital position, financial condition, liquidity and other factors, including regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to Pinnacle Financial and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of each of Pinnacle Financial's or Pinnacle Bank's financial results. 
 
 Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank periodically evaluate risk weightings and may enter into transactions or undertake procedures that may reduce risk weightings, such as during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 when Pinnacle Financial entered into a CDS, as more fully described in Note 9. Derivative Instruments , and implemented enhanced control processes with respect to certain commercial loans which permitted recharacterization of the loans, each of which reduced risk weighted assets of both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank. 
 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Pinnacle Financial and its banking subsidiary to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average assets.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following is a discussion of our financial condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Form 10-K) and the other reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since we filed that Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "Pinnacle Financial," "we," "our," or similar terms refer to Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 
 General. Our diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.86 and 4.08, respectively, compared to 1.69 and 5.99, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. At September 30, 2024, loans increased to 34.3 billion as compared to 32.7 billion at December 31, 2023, and total deposits increased to 41.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from 38.5 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations. Our net interest income increased to 351.5 million and 1.0 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 317.2 million and 944.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing an increase of 34.3 million, or 10.8 , and 56.9 million, or 6.0 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting these increases in net interest income were continued increases in cost of funds compared to the prior year's comparable periods. The net interest margin (the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.22 and 3.14 , respectively, compared to 3.06 and 3.22 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023 and reflects a full-quarter impact of the capital optimization initiatives and balance sheet restructuring completed in the second quarter of 2024 as well as increased average earning asset balances and the intentional focus of our relationship managers on obtaining appropriate pricing on new and renewing loans and keeping our deposit pricing contained as well as the stability of our noninterest bearing deposit balances during the quarter. 
 
 Our provision for credit losses was 26.3 million and 90.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.8 million and 77.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Provision expense is relatively flat in the comparable three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The change in provision expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of specific reserves associated with a 38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan that was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023. Also impacting provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were net charge-offs totaling 18.3 million and 57.5 million, respectively, compared to 18.1 million and 35.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Negatively impacting net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was the deterioration of a single commercial and industrial loan which resulted in a charge-off of 9.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024 the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan resulted in a charge-off of 10.3 million. The increase in charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the combination of the charge-off of these two loans. 
 Noninterest income increased by 24.4 million, or 26.9 , and decreased by 94.5 million, or 26.7 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) reflect strong revenue growth increasing 6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts also reflect strong revenue growth with an increase of 3.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Interchange and other consumer fees also positively impacted noninterest income with an increase of 1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Income related to bank-owned life insurance also positively impacted noninterest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with an increase of 4.4 million when compared to the same period in 2023 primarily attributable to restructuring activities initiated late in 2023. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we recognized 1.8 million in gains on the sale of fixed assets. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in income related to our equity method investment in BHG of 8.6 million, or 34.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023.

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in noninterest income is due primarily to the intentional repositioning of a portion of our securities portfolio with the goal of meaningfully enhancing its future performance with the sale of approximately 822.7 million of available-for-sale securities at a net loss of 72.1 million. Additionally, negatively impacting noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was a decline in income from our equity method investment in BHG of 19.9 million, or 28.0 . Also significantly contributing to the decline in noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were gains on the sale of fixed assets of 85.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily the result of the sale-leaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of 2023. These declines were offset in part for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by the recognition of a mortgage servicing asset associated with our Freddie Mac Small Business Lending (SBL) platform of approximately 11.8 million during the first quarter of 2024, which has been reflected in other noninterest income. Also positively impacting noninterest income were wealth management revenues of 83.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 69.3 million in the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased by 46.1 million, or 21.6 , and 136.5, or 21.4 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Impacting noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods was an increase of 29.9 million and 57.9 million, respectively, in salaries and employee benefits. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in our associate base to 3,516.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2024 versus 3,329.5 at September 30, 2023, as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2024 and increases in cash and equity incentive accruals due to our belief at September 30, 2024 that we were likely to achieve a payout percentage under our annual cash incentive plan in 2024 that would be higher than what we paid out under our 2023 annual cash incentive plan and under our performance-based vesting restricted stock unit awards based on estimated performance through September 30, 2024. Noninterest expense categories, other than salaries and employee benefits, were 99.1 million and 316.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 82.9 million and 238.1 million, respectively, during three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, increases of 19.5 and 33.0 , respectively. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same 2023 periods were impacted by changes in equipment and occupancy costs and lending and deposit-related expenses. Equipment and occupancy costs were 42.6 million and 123.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 36.9 million and 101.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were negatively impacted by the overall growth in our infrastructure, additional locations added, new technology implemented and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, higher levels of lease expense as a result of the execution of the sale-leaseback transaction in the second quarter of 2023. Lending-related expenses were 17.7 million and 44.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.5 million and 37.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and were negatively impacted by the loss protection fees of 2.1 million associated with the execution of a credit default swap during the second quarter of 2024. Deposit-related expenses were 15.9 million and 52.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.1 million and 36.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Impacting deposit-related expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a 6.8 million increase in the FDIC special assessment which was originally estimated in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was revised in 2024. Additionally impacting the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 27.6 million in fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 to terminate an agreement to resell 500.0 million of securities we had previously purchased. 
 
 Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 55.6 and 61.3 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.3 and 49.0 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. Our efficiency ratio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense discussed above. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 34.5 million and 73.6 million, respectively, compared to 35.4 million and 118.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.0 and 18.5 , respectively, compared to 21.1 and 20.2 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our tax rate in each period was impacted by, among other things, the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized excess tax benefits of 131,000 and 2.6 million, respectively, in connection with the vesting and exercise of such equity-based awards compared to tax expense of 16,000 and excess tax benefits of 241,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in excess tax benefits recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was the primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate between periods.

 Financial Condition. Loans increased 1.6 billion, or 5.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in the markets in which we have recently entered or expanded our presence, increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company. Loan growth was also positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by the continued growth of certain specialty lending groups, including franchise lending and equipment lease financing. During 2023, we made the intentional decision to continue the tightening of our underwriting, particularly in construction and commercial real estate (CRE) investment property. We expect that to continue through the end of 2024 and our loan growth rates over such period should reflect this tightening. Total deposits were 41.0 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 38.5 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.4 billion, or 6.3 . Interest-bearing deposits grew during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately 1.3 billion, or 11.0 , from December 31, 2023, as a result of our intentional focus on gathering and retaining these deposits. 
 At September 30, 2024, our allowance for credit losses was 391.5 million compared to 353.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of specific reserves associated with a 38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan that was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an overall increase in loan loss reserves due to the impact of the changing macroeconomic environment on our CECL models. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 net charge-offs were 18.3 million and 57.5 million, respectively, compared to 18.1 million and 35.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Negatively impacting net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was the deterioration of a single commercial and industrial loan which resulted in a charge-off of 9.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024 the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan resulted in a charge-off of 10.3 million. The increase in charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the combination of the charge-off of these two loans. 
 Capital and Liquidity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 11. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q) for additional information regarding our capital ratios. From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 192.0 million of cash that could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels. 
 
 On January 16, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the previously authorized share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2024. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2025. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during 2023 or the first nine months of 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with U.S. GAAP and with general practices within the banking industry. There have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates as described in our Form 10-K.

Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various interest-earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. Net interest income totaled 351.5 million and 1.0 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 317.2 million and 944.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year, representing increases of 34.3 million, or 10.8 , and 56.9 million, or 6.0 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable periods in 2023, this increase was largely the result of organic loan growth and yield expansion in our earning asset portfolio. Partially offsetting these increases in net interest income were continued increases in cost of funds compared to the prior year's comparable periods.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest margin was 3.22 and 3.14 , respectively, compared to 3.06 and 3.22 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The expansion in our net interest margin during the comparable three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is the result of continued average loan yield improvement and the impact of the restructuring of our investment securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024. The compression in our net interest margin during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 reflects the rise in cost of funds due to the elevated short-term interest rate environment, the competitive rate environments for deposits in our markets and increased reliance on brokered deposits and other sources of wholesale funding. The prior inversion of the yield curve, where short term interest rates rise above intermediate and long-term rates and which began easing in the third quarter of 2024 and reversed in September 2024, has also resulted in asset yields increasing at a slower pace than the cost of funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to September 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our earning asset yield increased by 32 basis points and 47 basis points, respectively, from the same periods in the prior year. Conversely, our total funding rates, led by increases in interest-bearing deposits rates, increased by 18 basis points and 58 basis points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 
 We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but, subject to internal policy limits on the amount of wholesale funding we may maintain, will utilize wholesale funding to fund shortfalls, if any, or provide additional liquidity. To the extent that our dependence on wholesale funding sources increases, as was the case during the year ended December 31, 2023, our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted as we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on these deposits as quickly as we can on core deposits as rates have and may continue to decline. 
 
 We continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. During 2023, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by 100 basis points. Our most likely forecast for short-term rates through 2024 at the time of our most recent ALCO meeting was mostly consistent with the federal funds futures market s expectations for rate movements at that time but there is uncertainty in the interest rate futures markets. Thus far in 2024, the Federal Reserve has reduced short-term interest rates by 50 basis points. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses. Our provision for credit losses was 26.3 million and 90.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.8 million and 77.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The provision for credit losses is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio, recent historical and projected future economic conditions, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and net charge-offs. The change in provision expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of reserves associated with a 38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023. Also impacting provision expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were net charge-offs totaling 18.3 million and 57.5 million, respectively, compared to 18.1 million and 35.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Negatively impacting net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was the deterioration of a single commercial and industrial loan which resulted in a charge-off of 9.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024 the continued deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral of an owner-occupied commercial real estate loan resulted in a charge-off of 10.3 million. The increase in charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily the result of the combination of the charge-off of these two loans. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Our noninterest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods. Service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect our growth, while investment services, fees from the origination of mortgage loans, swap fees and gains or losses on the sale of securities will often reflect financial market conditions or our asset/liability management efforts and fluctuate from period to period.

 The following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - 2023 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: Service charges on deposit accounts 16,217 12,665 28.0 44,219 36,563 20.9 Investment services 17,868 13,253 34.8 48,339 39,022 23.9 Insurance sales commissions 3,286 2,882 14.0 10,853 10,598 2.4 Gains on mortgage loans sold, net 2,643 2,012 31.4 8,792 5,632 56.1 Investment losses on sales of securities, net (9,727) >100 (72,103) (19,688) >(100 Trust fees 8,383 6,640 26.3 24,121 19,696 22.5 Income from equity method investment 16,379 24,967 (34.4) 51,102 70,970 (28.0) Gain on sale of fixed assets 1,837 87 >100 2,220 85,946 (97.4) Other noninterest income: Interchange and other consumer fees 19,939 18,156 9.8 58,162 52,222 11.4 Bank-owned life insurance 10,172 5,822 74.7 29,870 17,132 74.4 Loan swap fees 2,798 1,461 91.5 4,638 5,443 (14.8) SBA loan sales 1,207 725 66.5 4,875 2,897 68.3 Income from other equity investments 6,226 5,837 6.7 12,375 9,511 30.1 Other noninterest income 8,287 6,017 37.7 32,170 18,221 76.6 Total other noninterest income 48,629 38,018 27.9 142,090 105,426 34.8 Total noninterest income 115,242 90,797 26.9 259,633 354,165 (26.7) 
 
 Our fee categories of wealth management and service charges on deposit accounts, including interchange and other consumer fees, reflect strong revenue growth. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts of 3.6 million, or 28.0 , and 7.7 million, or 20.9 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to revenues from commercial deposit accounts, including analysis fee revenue, as well as increased consumer check card fees reflective of growth in our deposit accounts and the economic strength of our markets. 
 
 Income from our wealth management groups (investments, insurance and trust) is also included in noninterest income and was impacted in part during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by market volatility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit, Pinnacle Asset Management, a division of Pinnacle Bank, and fees from our wealth advisory group, PNFP Capital Markets, Inc., increased by approximately 4.6 million and 9.3 million, respectively, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, Pinnacle Asset Management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately 12.8 billion and 9.0 billion, respectively, in brokerage assets. Revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 404,000 and 255,000, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Included in insurance revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.0 million of contingent income that was recorded in the period but based on 2023 sales production and claims experience compared to 1.7 million recorded in the same period in the prior year that was based on 2022 sales production and claims experience. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 our trust department was receiving fees on approximately 6.8 billion of managed assets compared to 5.0 billion at September 30, 2023. We believe the improvement of 6.8 million, or 29.7 , and 14.0 million, or 20.2 , respectively, in income from our wealth management lines of business during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in the number of wealth management advisors, a significant percentage of whom are located in our newer markets and the strong performance of the broader market in 2024.

 Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising or higher interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, were 2.6 million and 8.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million and 5.6 million for the same periods in the prior year. Similar to wealth management, the increase in mortgage fee income was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of mortgage bankers, a significant percentage of whom are located in our newer markets. We hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program whereby the hedge protects against changes in the fair value of the pipeline. The hedge is not designated as a hedge for U.S. GAAP purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement. The change in the fair value of the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period. At September 30, 2024, the mortgage pipeline included 91.9 million in loans expected to close in 2024 compared to 81.6 million in loans at September 30, 2023 expected to close in 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 822.7 million of investment securities were sold in our available-for-sale securities portfolio compared to 303.1 million of investment securities sold in our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net losses on the sale of these investment securities were 72.1 million and 19.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In both periods, these securities were sold in an effort to reposition our securities portfolio to enhance future earning potential. 
 
 For any securities classified as available-for-sale that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date, we assess whether or not we intend to sell the security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security, before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a write-down to fair value through net income. Because we currently do not intend to sell those available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024, and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, we have determined that no write-down is necessary. 
 
 Income from equity-method investment. Income from equity-method investment is comprised solely of income from Pinnacle Bank's 49 equity-method investment in BHG. BHG is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans largely to healthcare providers and other skilled professionals throughout the United States. The loans originated by BHG are either financed by secured borrowings or sold to independent financial institutions and investors. 
 
 Income from this equity-method investment was 16.4 million and 51.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.0 million and 71.0 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. In 2019, BHG began retaining more loans on its balance sheet. For much of its history, BHG has sold the majority of the loans it originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions, direct sales and its direct purchase option. BHG s decision to sell loans through its auction platform (or, recently, directly to institutional investors) or retain loans on its balance sheet will be impacted by a variety of factors, including interest rates, credit experience and demand levels from the community bank network of buyers and institutional buyers to whom BHG markets these loans. In a rising or elevated rate environment, BHG may choose to sell more loans if the cost of financing loans on its balance sheet is not as attractive as a sale, either directly to asset managers or through its auction platform while in a falling or low rate environment it may choose to retain more loans on its balance sheet if funding alternatives for doing so are attractive. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, BHG sold loans totaling approximately 950 million and 546 million, respectively, directly to asset managers. Since 2020, BHG has completed nine securitizations totaling 2.9 billion, with the latest securitization of approximately 300 million having been completed in the first quarter of 2024. BHG also entered into funding facilities in the fourth quarter of 2022, first quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024 including facilities with U.S. asset managers with outstanding balances of 438 million and 506 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and an annualized interest rate at September 30, 2024 of approximately 7.78 . These facilities, which are secured by loans on BHG's balance sheet, represent incremental funding sources to BHG. We anticipate that BHG will complete additional securitizations in the future or otherwise establish other borrowing facilities to facilitate the retention of additional loans on BHG's balance sheet. 
 
 Income from equity-method investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets associated with Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG of 60,000 and 178,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 88,000 and 262,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there wer e 5.8 million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next 12 years. Also included in income from equity-method investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of BHG's liabilities of 34,000 and 108,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43,000 and 183,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there were 100,000 of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next three years.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank received dividends of 24.8 million and 71.7 million, respectively, from BHG compared to 5.6 million and 33.2 million, respectively, received during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Dividends from BHG during such periods reduced the carrying amount of Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG, while earnings from BHG during such periods increased the carrying amount of Pinnacle Bank's investment in BHG. Profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated. Our proportionate share of earnings from BHG is included in our consolidated tax return. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, Pinnacle Bank purchased no loans from BHG. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 177.7 million and 263.0 million, respectively, of BHG joint venture program loans held by Pinnacle Bank. These loans were purchased at par from BHG by Pinnacle Bank and BHG and Pinnacle Bank share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase. The yield on this portfolio to Pinnacle Bank is between 4.50 and 6.00 per annum. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank sold 10.2 million and 30.7 million, respectively, of BHG joint venture program loans back to BHG at par. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BHG reported 202.1 million and 708.2 million, respectively, in revenues, net of substitution and prepayment losses of 112.5 million and 273.2 million, respectively, compared to revenues of 311.3 million and 924.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net of substitution and prepayment losses of 52.4 million and 194.7 million, respectively. Earnings from BHG are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period. Approximately 65.1 million and 267.0 million, respectively, or 32.2 and 37.7 , respectively, of BHG's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to gains on the sale of commercial and consumer loans compared to 147.9 million and 451.0 million, respectively, or 47.5 and 48.8 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These loans have typically been sold by BHG with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan, although the purchaser may access a BHG cash reserve account of up to 3 of the loan balance to support loan payments. BHG retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold. As a result, this gain on sale premium represents BHG's compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BHG sold loans to its network of community banks and other financial institutions totaling 793 million and 2.4 billion, respectively, compared to 1.0 billion and 3.2 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 7.3 billion and 6.4 billion, respectively, of these loans previously sold by BHG that were being actively serviced by the purchasing banks. BHG, at its sole option, may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recently-issued BHG loan should the previously-acquired loan become at least 90-days past due as to its monthly payments. As a result, BHG maintained a liability as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 453.5 million and 350.3 million, respectively, that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or prepayment. This liability represents 6.2 and 5.5 , respectively, of core product loans previously sold by BHG that remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the dollar amount of this liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period ended September 30, 2023 was principally the result of an increase in the amount of loans previously sold by BHG to financial institutions that remain outstanding, BHG's historical loss experience with these loans and BHG management's estimate of future substitution losses due to economic uncertainty. 
 
 In addition to these loans that BHG sells into its auction market or directly to institutional investors, at September 30, 2024, BHG reported loans that remained on BHG's balance sheet totaling 3.0 billion compared to 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in BHG's loans held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 is primarily due to strong demand from purchasers in its community bank network of buyers which has led BHG to prioritize loan sales over retaining the loans. A portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, BHG had 2.2 billion and 2.8 billion, respectively, of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, BHG reported an allowance for credit losses totaling 236.9 million and 213.5 million, respectively, with respect to the loans on its balance sheet. The increase in allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally the result of the uncertain economic environment, increased levels of losses on these loans and BHG's adoption of CECL on October 1, 2023. Prior to October 1, 2023, BHG recorded its allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method. Interest income and fees associated with these on-balance sheet loans amounted to 126.5 million and 392.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 142.2 million and 428.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Gains on the sale of fixed assets were 1.8 million and 2.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 87,000 and 85.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gains on the sale of fixed assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of a gain on the sale of one asset during the third quarter of 2024. The gains on the sale of fixed assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily the result of the sale-leaseback transaction which was completed in the second quarter of 2023.

 Included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees, gains from bank-owned life insurance, swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients, Small Business Administration (SBA) loan sales and other noninterest income items. Interchange revenues increased 9.8 and 11.4 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of increased commercial and merchant credit card usage. Other noninterest income also includes changes in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) which was 10.2 million and 29.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.8 million and 17.1 million, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies) on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers, which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers, subject to any applicable floors. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we restructured approximately 740 million of BOLI contracts held by various insurance carries. The increase in BOLI revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the comparable period in 2023 is a direct result of this restructuring and death benefit proceeds we received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan swap fees increased 1.3 million and decreased 805,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. SBA loan sales are included in other noninterest income and increased by 482,000 and 2.0 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The change in both loan swap fees and SBA loan sales are most directly impacted by the changing market conditions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties, or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through financial reports provided by the portfolio managers of the investment. Income related to these investments increased 389,000 and 2.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The year-over-year increase for the nine-month period is primarily the result of earnings from a solar equity investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period. The other components of other noninterest income increased 2.3 million and 13.9 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of recognition during the first quarter of 2024 of an 11.8 million mortgage servicing right associated with our Freddie Mac SBL platform. 
 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and occupancy expenses, other real estate expenses and other operating expenses. The following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024-2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024-2023 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits: Salaries and commissions 103,354 91,421 13.1 301,560 269,144 12.0 Cash and equity incentives 33,513 18,520 81.0 85,697 64,944 32.0 Employee benefits and other 23,367 20,403 14.5 69,104 64,407 7.3 Total salaries and employee benefits 160,234 130,344 22.9 456,361 398,495 14.5 Equipment and occupancy 42,564 36,900 15.3 123,246 100,959 22.1 Other real estate expense, net 56 33 69.7 162 190 (14.7 Marketing and other business development 5,599 5,479 2.2 18,500 17,085 8.3 Postage and supplies 2,965 2,621 13.1 8,871 8,303 6.8 Amortization of intangibles 1,558 1,765 (11.7 4,710 5,339 (11.8 Other noninterest expense: Deposit related expense 15,891 14,138 12.4 52,886 36,158 46.3 Lending related expense 17,729 12,508 41.7 43,959 37,165 18.3 Wealth management related expense 807 734 9.9 2,585 2,239 15.5 Other noninterest expense 11,916 8,711 36.8 61,793 30,668 >100 Total other noninterest expense 46,343 36,091 28.4 161,223 106,230 51.8 Total noninterest expense 259,319 213,233 21.6 773,073 636,601 21.4

 Total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased 29.9 million and 57.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The change in salaries and employee benefits was largely the result of an increase in our associate base in 2024 versus 2023 as well as annual merit increases effective in January 2024 and increased cash and equity incentive expenses. Our associate base increased to 3,516.5 full-time equivalent associates at September 30, 2024 from 3,329.5 at September 30, 2023. We expect total salary and benefit expenses for the year ended 2024 to increase when compared to the comparable period in 2023 as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets. 
 
 We believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value. As a result, and unlike many other financial institutions, all of our bank's non-commissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to 10 of each associate's annual salary, and all of our bank's associates participate in our equity compensation plans. Under the 2024 annual cash incentive plan, the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of annual earnings per common share and annual revenues (subject to certain adjustments). To the extent that the soundness threshold is met and earnings per common share and revenues are above or below the targeted amount, the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased. Historically, we have paid between 0 and 125 of our targeted incentives. For 2024, our annual incentive plan provides for maximum payouts of up to 125 of target. 
 
 Cash incentive expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 23.1 million and 54.3 million, respectively, compared to 8.4 million and 35.4 million, respectively, during the same prior year periods due to an increased number of associates and our estimate at September 30, 2024 that we are likely to achieve a payout percentage under our annual cash incentive plan in 2024 that would be higher than what we paid out under our annual cash incentive plan in 2023. 
 
 Also included in cash and equity incentives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.5 million and 13.5 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share awards compared to 4.2 million and 12.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as approximately 5.9 million and 17.9 million, respectively, of compensation expenses related to equity-based restricted share units with either time-based or performance-based vesting criteria compared to 5.9 million and 17.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the comparable periods in 2023 is due, in part, to our estimated performance under our performance-based restricted share unit awards through September 30, 2024. Under our equity incentive plans, we provide a broad-based equity incentive program for all of our bank's associates, a significant percentage of which is performance-based for our senior executive officers. We believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of Pinnacle Financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholder-centric culture throughout our organization. 
 
 Employee benefits and other expenses include costs associated with our 401k plan, health insurance, payroll taxes and contract labor. These expenses increased by 3.0 million and 4.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods. These increases reflect the increase in our associate base in the respective periods. 
 
 Equipment and occupancy expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 42.6 million and 123.2 million, respectively, compared to 36.9 million and 101.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is in large part due to the sale-leaseback transaction completed in the second quarter of 2023. Also impacting equipment and occupancy expense were costs associated with the opening of eight new locations across our footprint during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the opening of five new locations during the comparable period in 2023. The planned relocation of our corporate headquarters to a new location in early 2025 has also impacted equipment and occupancy expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we expect the costs associated with this relocation to increase as we approach our relocation date, which we expect will begin in the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Marketing and business development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.6 million and 18.5 million, respectively, compared to 5.5 million and 17.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We continue to expect these costs to rise modestly in 2024 when compared to 2023 taking into account anticipated increases associated with the associates we have hired in the last twelve months and expect to hire during the remainder of 2024.

 Intangible amortization expense was 1.6 million and 4.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million and 5.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets, their initial valuation and amortizable lives at September 30, 2024: 
 Year acquired Initial Valuation (in millions) Amortizable Life (in years) Remaining Value (in millions) Core Deposit Intangible: Avenue 2016 8.8 9 0.1 BNC 2017 48.1 10 9.5 Book of Business Intangible: Miller Loughry Beach Insurance 2008 1.3 20 0.1 CapitalMark 2015 0.3 16 0.1 BNC Insurance 2017 0.4 20 0.2 BNC Trust 2017 1.9 10 0.5 Advocate Capital 2019 13.6 13 4.0 JB B Capital 2022 6.7 10 4.5 Sweeney Asset Management 2022 0.8 10 0.7 
 
 These assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets. Annual amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from 5.7 million to 1.1 million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period. 
 
 Other noninterest expenses, which consists primarily of deposit, lending, wealth management and administrative expenses increased by 10.3 million and 55.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary increase in other noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year period is the result of approximately 27.6 million in fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 for the termination of an agreement to resell securities previously purchased. Additionally, deposit related expense increased by 1.8 million and 16.7 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is due in part to increased FDIC insurance assessments which were 200,000 and 11.9 million, respectively, higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 than in the same prior year periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, deposit related expenses included a 6.8 million estimate of the special assessment expected to be assessed by the FDIC as it seeks to recover losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with the multiple high-profile bank failures which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. This amount was in addition to the initial estimate of 29.0 million we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to this special assessment. Lending related expense, which represents costs associated with loan origination as well as operation of our credit card program, increased by 5.2 million and 6.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of increased costs related to credit card reward programs and by the loss protection fees of 2.1 million associated with the execution of a credit default swap during the second quarter of 2024. Wealth management related expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 grew 73,000 and 346,000, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Our efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 55.6 and 61.3 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.3 and 49.0 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was both positively and negatively impacted by the changes to net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense discussed above, with the most significant impact during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 the result of the losses we experienced in connection with the repositioning of our securities portfolio completed during the second quarter of 2024.

 Income Taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 34.5 million and 73.6 million, respectively, compared to 35.4 million and 118.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.0 and 18.5 , respectively, compared to 21.1 and 20.2 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of 25.00 at September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary, participation in Tennessee's Community Investment Tax Credit program, tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and bank-owned life insurance, offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense, non-deductible FDIC insurance premiums and non-deductible executive compensation. Our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards previously granted under our equity-based compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized excess tax benefits of 131,000 and 2.6 million, respectively, compared to tax expense of 16,000 and excess tax benefits of 241,000, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 with respect to the vesting of equity-based awards and the exercise of employee stock options. The increase in excess tax benefits recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was a primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate between periods. 

Financial Condition 
 
 Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to 34.3 billion compared to 32.7 billion at December 31, 2023. Total deposits increased by 2.4 billion to 41.0 billion between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Total assets were 50.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 48.0 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loans. The composition of loans at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 and the percentage ) of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate: Owner occupied 4,264,743 12.4 4,044,896 12.4 Non-owner occupied 8,132,388 23.7 7,535,494 23.1 Consumer real estate mortgage 4,907,766 14.3 4,851,531 14.8 Construction and land development 3,486,504 10.2 4,041,081 12.4 Commercial and industrial 12,986,865 37.9 11,666,691 35.7 Consumer and other 530,044 1.5 536,398 1.6 Total loans 34,308,310 100.0 32,676,091 100.0 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio composition had changed slightly from the composition at December 31, 2023 with commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continuing to make up the largest segments of our portfolio. At September 30, 2024, approximately 34.4 of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate properties compared to 34.9 at December 31, 2023. Owner occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate. We are pursuing reduced levels of commercial real estate loans by significantly limiting growth in these loan segments until certain benchmarks are achieved. 
 
 Lending Concentrations. We periodically analyze our loan portfolio to determine if a concentration of credit risk exists to any one or more industries. We use broadly accepted industry classification systems in order to classify borrowers into various industry classifications. We have a credit exposure (loans outstanding plus unfunded commitments) exceeding 25 of Pinnacle Bank's total risk-based capital to borrowers in the following industries at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Outstanding Principal Balances Unfunded Commitments Total exposure Total Exposure at December 31, 2023 Lessors of nonresidential buildings 4,578,913 872,139 5,451,052 5,916,335 Lessors of residential buildings 2,278,972 609,958 2,888,930 3,179,041 New Housing For-Sale Builders 562,830 806,163 1,368,993 1,396,653 Music Publishers 862,574 307,707 1,170,281 1,219,781

 Banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than 100 of total risk-based capital and for the non-owner occupied ratio of less than 300 of total risk-based capital. Should a bank s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by Pinnacle Bank s total risk-based capital. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank s construction and land development loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 68.2 compared to 84.2 at December 31, 2023. Construction and land development, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital were 243.3 and 259.0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Over time, we have targeted a non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily and construction and land development loans to total risk-based capital ratio of less than 225 and construction and land development loans to total risk-based capital ratio of less than 70 . At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank was below the target for construction and land development loans and as such began considering originating new loans using a measured underwriting process, focusing on high-quality developer clients primarily focused in the industrial and multifamily CRE segments. Pinnacle Bank believes it has established appropriate controls to monitor and regulate its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the 100 and 300 thresholds.

 Loans in Past Due Status. The following table is a summary of our loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 89 days and 90 days or more past due as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

 Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets, amounted to approximately 48.2 million, or 0.1 of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 127.4 million, or 0.4 of total loans at December 31, 2023. Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with present repayment terms. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Pinnacle Bank's primary regulators, for loans classified as substandard, or worse, but not considered nonperforming loans. Potential problem loans totaling 5.2 million were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Nonperforming Assets and Modified Loans. At September 30, 2024, we had 120.1 million in nonperforming assets compared to 86.6 million at December 31, 2023. Included in nonperforming assets were 119.3 million in nonaccrual loans, or 0.34 of total loans, and 823,000 in OREO and other nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 and 82.3 million in nonaccrual loans, or 0.25 of total loans, and 4.3 million in OREO and other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2023. The change in nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is largely the result of an increased amount of commercial and industrial and consumer real estate loans being assigned to nonaccrual status. At September 30, 2024, there were 31.7 million of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, of which 28.5 million were accruing as of the modification date and remain on accrual status. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACL). The current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology requires us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio. Accordingly, the ACL represents an amount that, in management's evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of the date of its calculation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our ACL was approximately 391.5 million and 353.1 million, respectively, which our management believed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our ACL as a percentage of total loans was 1.14 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.08 at December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL since December 31, 2023 is primarily the result of reserves associated with a 38 million loan which was previously identified as a problem loan and was placed on nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an overall increase in credit loss reserves for loans due to the impact of the changing macroeconomic environment on our CECL model. 

57 

Table of Contents 

 Our CECL models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses. Macroeconomic factors used in the model include the unadjusted and seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate, GDP, commercial property price index, consumer credit, commercial real estate price index, household debt ratio, household financial obligations ratio and certain home price indices. Projections of these macroeconomic factors, obtained from an independent third party, are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default. 
 
 Under the CECL methodology, the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, evaluations are performed on an individual basis. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a reasonable and supportable period of fifteen months was utilized for all loan segments followed by a twelve month straight line reversion period to long term averages. 
 
 The following table sets forth, based on management's estimate, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans to categories of loans, loan balances by category, the percentage of loans in each category to total loans and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans within each loan category as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

 Pinnacle Financial's management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans on a quarterly basis. This assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance. The level of the allowance is based upon management's evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay the loan (including the timing of future payments), the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors, including regulatory recommendations. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged-off. 
 Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for credit losses on loans to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at September 30, 2024. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact, materially, our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and, thus, the resulting provision for credit losses. 
 
 Investments. Our investment securities portfolio, consisting primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, Federal agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities, amounted to 8.3 billion and 7.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income, as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source. A summary of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Weighted average life 9.11 years 8.05 years Effective duration 1.99 2.93 Tax equivalent yield 4.58 4.12 
 ) The metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings. The effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 6.18 and 6.19 , respectively. 
 
 Restricted Cash. Our restricted cash balances totaled approximately 193.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 86.9 million at December 31, 2023. This restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio. The increase in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a increase in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has decreased. See Note 9. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Securities Purchased with Agreement to Resell. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 66.5 million and 558.0 million, respectively, in securities purchased with agreement to resell. This balance is the result of repurchase agreement transactions with financial institution counterparties. During the second quarter of 2024, we terminated an agreement to resell 500.0 million of securities purchased with an agreement to resell to reposition these funds into higher yielding assets. In connection with terminating the agreement, we paid approximately 27.6 million in fees. We initially secured these investments to allow us to deploy some of our excess liquidity position into instruments that improved the return on funds in the then current historically low interest rate environment. The remaining repurchase agreements are set to mature in 2026. 
 
 Deposits and Other Borrowings. We had approximately 41.0 billion of deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 38.5 billion at December 31, 2023. Our deposits consist of noninterest and interest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that we had approximately 15.0 billion and 11.1 billion, respectively, in uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. We estimate that we had approximately 2.4 billion and 2.0 billion, respectively, in our uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which were collateralized at those dates. We routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements (which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns for their excess funds) amounted to 210.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 209.5 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Pinnacle Bank had borrowed 2.1 billion in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). The amount of FHLB advances at each date was impacted by our decision in the first half of 2023 to increase our levels of on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the current economic environment and its impact on the banking sector following the failures of multiple high-profile banking institutions. At September 30, 2024, Pinnacle Bank had approximately 3.0 billion in additional availability with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB.

 (1) The reciprocating categories consists of time and money market deposits we receive from a bank network (the IntraFi network) in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our FDIC coverage limit that we place with the IntraFi network. Regulatory guidance defines reciprocating deposits in a portfolio of a bank of our size over and above 5.0 billion as noncore funding. However, we have witnessed no distinction in the behavior of the deposits in our portfolio over and above 5.0 billion versus the deposits up to 5.0 billion. Therefore, we have included the entire portfolio of reciprocating deposits in the table above as core funding. 
 
 As noted in the table above, our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased slightly, moving from 81.7 at December 31, 2023 to 81.8 at September 30, 2024 and remained above internal policies. We experienced a mix shift in deposits during 2023 as a result of the multiple high-profile bank failures in the first half of 2023 as certain of our depositors opted for additional insurance by way of the reciprocating deposit accounts we offer through the IntraFi network and certain of our depositors moved their deposits out of non-interest bearing accounts and into interest-bearing accounts to take advantage of increased rates. Thus far in 2024, our noninterest bearing deposit accounts have stabilized. Additionally, we continue to create and implement new and enhanced deposit gathering initiatives each year as part of our annual strategic planning process in recognition of the more challenging deposit gathering environment we are currently experiencing. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement our core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives. Our Asset Liability Management Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically. Both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of September 30, 2024.

 We have established, or through acquisition acquired, twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30-year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements. From time to time we, or our bank subsidiary, have issued subordinated notes to enhance our capital positions. These trust-preferred securities and subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital subject to annual phase outs, with such phase outs beginning five years from maturity, as is the case with the subordinated notes we issued in September 2019 beginning in the third quarter of 2024.

 Capital Resources. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our shareholders' equity amounted to 6.3 billion and 6.0 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our capital ratios, including our bank's capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulations. See Note 11. Regulatory Matters in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our capital ratios. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we executed a credit default swap arrangement (CDS) with a notional amount of 86.5 million with a counterparty which equaled 5 percent of a reference pool of 1.7 billion of first lien consumer real estate - mortgage loans whereby the counterparty has assumed the first-loss position for these loans up to approximately 86.5 million in aggregate losses. We pay to the counterparty an annual loss protection fee equal to 7.95 of the corresponding notional amount of the CDS, for as long as the loans in the reference pool remain outstanding. The notional amount of the CDS will decline over time as the loans in the reference portfolio are paid down, mature or the investor absorbs the first loss portion of any loan losses on those loans. Additionally, and in accordance with regulatory guidelines, during the second quarter of 2024 we implemented enhanced control processes with respect to certain commercial loans which permits recharacterization of these loans in order to reduce the risk weights assigned to these loans. As a result, the loans subject to the CDS and the loans where risk ratings were able to be recharacterized now qualify for reduced risk weights pursuant to risk-based capital guidelines. The benefits of these reductions in risk weighting offset the impact to regulatory capital of the 72.1 million net loss on sale of approximately 822.7 million of investment securities and the approximately 27.6 million in fees related to the termination of the agreement to resell securities previously purchased recognized in conjunction with the repositioning of our securities portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 From time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank (Pinnacle Bank). At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 192.0 million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank, such as issuing subordinated debt or entering into a revolving credit facility with a financial institution. We also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels.

Share Repurchase Program. On January 17, 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 125.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization for this program remained in effect through March 31, 2024. On January 16, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2024. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2025. We did not repurchase any shares under either share repurchase program during 2023 or the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Dividends. Pursuant to Tennessee banking law, our bank may not, without the prior consent of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank's retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years, which was 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024. Additionally, approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of Pinnacle Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the bank paid dividends of 80.3 million to us which is within the limits allowed by banking regulations. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 17.2 million and 51.8 million, respectively, in dividends to our common shareholders and 3.8 million and 11.4 million, respectively, in dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. On October 15, 2024, our board of directors declared a 0.22 per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate 17.2 million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on November 29, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 1, 2024. Additionally, on that same day, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately 3.8 million, or 16.88 per share (or 0.422 per depositary share), on the Series B Preferred Stock payable on December 1, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2024. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including, if necessary, our receipt of dividends from Pinnacle Bank, regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiary's financial results. 

Market and Liquidity Risk Management 
 
 Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity (EVE) model. 
 
 Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and EVE, including loan and deposit re-pricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments, etc. ALCO periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations. Our ALCO policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and EVE. Policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios. While the primary policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model, longer time horizons are also modeled. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled. 
 
 Earnings simulation model. We believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. For instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from management's flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 
 63 

Table of Contents 

Estimated Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Instantaneous Rate Change 
 300 bps increase 
 (0.66) 5.94 200 bps increase 
 (0.21) 4.41 100 bps increase 
 0.28 2.43 100 bps decrease 
 0.33 (2.37) 200 bps decrease 
 1.16 (3.81) 300 bps decrease 
 0.24 (5.52) 
 
 While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 
 
 The change in interest rate sensitivity between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024 set out in the table above is due to factors impacting both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. Over the past year, floating-rate, short-term liquidity decreased as a percent of interest-earning assets while non-maturity deposits indexed to the federal funds rate increased as a percent of interest-bearing liabilities. These two factors were the primary drivers behind reduced asset sensitivity and a more neutral interest rate position at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy. 
 
 Economic value of equity model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income, our EVE model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. We then shock rates as prescribed by our Asset Liability Policy and measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Asset Liability Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At September 30, 2024, our EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 
 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Instantaneous Rate Change 
 300 bps increase 
 (18.02) (17.32) 200 bps increase 
 (12.33) (12.03) 100 bps increase 
 (6.38) (6.25) 100 bps decrease 
 5.22 6.78 200 bps decrease 
 0.03 11.40 300 bps decrease 
 (3.89) 4.54 
 
 While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our EVE model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved Asset Liability Policy.

 Most likely earnings simulation models . We also analyze a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management. These processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firm's balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. 
 
 Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising or elevated interest rates. ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. 
 
 Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare our results to other firms. 
 
 ALCO may determine that Pinnacle Financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods. At present, ALCO has determined that its "most likely" rate scenario assumes two 25 basis point decreases in the Federal Funds Rate during the fourth quarter of 2024. Our "most likely" rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks. We may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time. 
 
 We have in the past used, and may in the future continue to use, derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity, including in our mortgage lending program, while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers. For further details on the derivatives we currently use, see Note 9. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps qualify as derivatives, even though they are not designated as hedging instruments. 
 
 Liquidity Risk Management . The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. 

65 

Table of Contents 

 To assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity, we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events. Liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers, both depositors and borrowers. We seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations. The amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our liquidity coverage ratio. 
 
 Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates, and our management intends to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. 
 
 Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. Our financial advisors attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. 
 
 As noted previously, Pinnacle Bank is a member of the FHLB and, pursuant to a borrowing agreement with the FHLB, has pledged certain assets pursuant to a blanket lien. As such, Pinnacle Bank may use the FHLB as a source of liquidity depending on the firm's ALCO strategies. Additionally, we may pledge additional qualifying assets or reduce the amount of pledged assets with the FHLB to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity at the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, we believe we had an estimated 3.0 billion in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB; however, incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by Pinnacle Bank and the subsequent approval by the FHLB. 
 
 Pinnacle Bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks for unsecured short-term advances which aggregate 105.0 million. These accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability, and in most cases must be repaid within less than one month. There were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements at September 30, 2024, or during the period then ended, although we test the availability of these accommodations periodically. Pinnacle Bank also had approximately 6.5 billion in available Federal Reserve discount window lines of credit at September 30, 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the IntraFi network, we had approximately 3.2 billion in brokered deposits and 12.6 billion in uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. Historically, we have issued brokered certificates through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid. 
 
 Banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines, through the issuance of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Modified LCR. These regulatory guidelines became effective January 2015 with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset (HQLA) buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event. Although Pinnacle Financial follows the principles outlined in the Interagency Policy Statement on Liquidity Risk Management, issued March 2010, to determine its HQLA buffer, Pinnacle Financial is not currently subject to these regulations. However, these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks, such as Pinnacle Bank, and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet, which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures. However, we believe the relocation of our headquarters in early 2025 does, as a whole, constitute a significant commitment for capital expenditure. We expect overall capital expenditures related to the relocation to approximate 47 million, inclusive of amounts we have already incurred, substantially all of which we expect to incur through mid-year 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had incurred 36.8 million of capital expenditure for the relocation project. Additionally, expansion of our locations, including non-branch locations, will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint, including the markets to which we have recently expanded, and certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations. In future periods, these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense. In addition to the above noted expenditures, if we were to breach the terms of one of the leases entered into in the sale-leaseback transaction and the counterparty terminated the lease in accordance with its terms, we may be forced to expend significant amounts of capital expenditures to lease, procure and build or renovate a suitable replacement office. Additionally, we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with planned technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm.

 Our short-term borrowings (borrowings which mature within the next fiscal year) consist primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase (these agreements are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with short-term returns on their excess funds). 
 
 We have certain contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024, which by their terms have a contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to September 30, 2024. Each of these commitments is noted throughout Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis . Our management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and reasonable borrower, depositor and creditor requirements over the next twelve months and that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations over a longer-term as well. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of 380.1 million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of 14.4 billion. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, Pinnacle Bank has the ability to liquidate securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis, to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. 
 
 We follow the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. At September 30, 2024, we had accrued reserves of 12.5 million related to expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments.

 ______________________ 
 (1) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 22,593 shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units previously awarded to certain of the participants in our equity incentive plans vested. We withheld 6,327 shares of common stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements associated with the vesting of these awards. 
 
 (2) On January 16, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 125.0 million of our common stock which commenced upon the expiration of the previously authorized share repurchase program that expired on March 31, 2024. The new authorization is to remain in effect through March 31, 2025. Share repurchases may be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, at the discretion of the management of Pinnacle Financial, after the board of directors of Pinnacle Financial authorizes a repurchase program. The approved share repurchase program does not obligate Pinnacle Financial to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. Stock repurchases generally are affected through open market purchases, and may be made through unsolicited negotiated transactions. The timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements. Pinnacle Financial did not repurchase any shares under its share repurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The Executive further expressly agrees that, in the event that the Executive breaches (as determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in its discretion) the covenants contained in this Section 5, then the Executive shall forfeit any amounts then owed to the Executive but not then paid thereto.

The Executive s agreement as set forth in this Section 5 will (i) continue throughout the duration of the Executive s employment with the Employer and (ii) survive the termination of this Agreement and or the termination of the Executive s employment with the Employer, whether or not such termination is voluntary or is the result of termination of the Executive by the Employer with or without Cause. 
 
 If any restriction in this Section 5 is adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, service or other limitations permitted by applicable law in the applicable jurisdiction, then the Executive agrees that such may be modified and narrowed, either by a court or the Employer, to the maximum time, geographic, service or other limitations permitted by applicable law, so as to preserve and protect the Employer s legitimate business interest, without negating or impairing any other restrictions or undertaking set forth in this Agreement. 
 
 6. SEVERABILITY.

Further, if any provision of this Agreement is ruled invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction because of a conflict between the provision and any applicable law or public policy, the provision shall be 

Exhibit 10.1 

 redrawn to make the provision consistent with and valid and enforceable under the law or public policy. 
 
 7. NO SET-OFF BY THE EXECUTIVE. The existence of any claim, demand, action or cause of action by the Executive against the Employer, or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Employer, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Employer of any of its rights hereunder.
