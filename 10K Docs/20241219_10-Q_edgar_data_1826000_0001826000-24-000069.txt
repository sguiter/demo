EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 Introduction 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the audit committee (the Audit Committee of Latch, Inc. s Latch, the Company, we or our board of directors (the Board commenced an investigation (the Investigation of certain of the Company s key performance indicators and revenue recognition practices, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related thereto. On August 19, 2022, based on the preliminary findings of the Investigation, the Audit Committee determined that the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the quarter ended March 31, 2022 should no longer be relied upon as a result of material errors and possible irregularities relating to, among other things, the manner in which the Company recognized revenue associated with the sale of hardware devices, primarily through third-party channel partners. Based on the preliminary findings of the Investigation, the Audit Committee expanded the scope of the Investigation to include prior periods and additional customers (as described below). On January 17, 2023, upon substantial completion of the Investigation, the Audit Committee determined that the Company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 also should no longer be relied upon. 
 Following the Investigation, the Company completed a comprehensive review of its previously issued financial statements (the Financial Statement Review ). As further detailed below, the Company identified errors related to, among other items: (i) revenue recognition of hardware and software sales, (ii) revenue recognition and billing on software licenses, (iii) recognition of various expenses and (iv) errors in certain key performance indicators, including bookings and related metrics. 
 As a result of the Investigation and Financial Statement Review, the Company is restating the financial statements (i) as of and for the period ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) for the period ended December 31, 2020 (collectively, the Restated Financial Statement Periods ), as presented in the audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed concurrently herewith (the 2022 Annual Report ). 
 Additionally, to reflect the impact of the restatement, the 2022 Annual Report includes selected financial data described in the Explanatory Note of the 2022 Annual Report (collectively, the Adjusted Financial Data ). Of such Adjusted Financial Data, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 (this Form 10-Q only includes the financial data as of and for the quarters and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021 (unaudited, restated). The reissued consolidated financial statements for the Restated Financial Statement Periods and the Adjusted Financial Data are referred to collectively in this Form 10-Q as the Restatement. 
 We are filing this Form 10-Q concurrently with the 2022 Annual Report and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022. These reports are our first periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2022. Because of the delay in our periodic reporting and the changes that have occurred in our business since our last periodic filing, the information contained in this Form 10-Q reflects, where appropriate, more recent information about our business. 
 The delay in periodic reporting resulted, in part, from the Company s decision to conduct the Financial Statement Review before the Company could finalize the Restatement. The Company believed the Financial Statement Review was necessary to ensure that the financial statements and information included in the 2022 Annual Report and this Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. 
 We believe that the turnover in our accounting and finance departments and the resulting lack of institutional knowledge also contributed to the delay in periodic reporting. 
 We have not filed, and do not intend to file, amendments to any of our previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q covering the Restated Financial Statement Periods or 2019. Accordingly, with respect to such periods, investors and others should rely only on the financial information and other disclosures contained in this Form 10-Q, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022, the 2022 Annual Report or our future filings with the SEC, and not on the financial statements of any previously issued or filed reports, earnings releases or similar communications relating to the Restated Financial Statement Periods and 2019. 
 Financial information related to the quarter ended June 30, 2022 is being presented in this Form 10-Q for the first time and is not subject to the Restatement. However, financial information related to the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and any other Restated Financial Statement Period is being presented in this Form 10-Q on a restated basis and marked as Restated. If a period presented in this Form 10-Q includes financial information that is both restated and being presented in this Form 10-Q for the first time, such as the six month period ended June 30, 2022, it is not marked as Restated.

Findings of Investigation 
 The Investigation included a broad and extensive review of documents, including, among other items, customer contracts, invoices, purchase orders, letters of intent, customer quotes, shipping documentation, product return approvals, emails and internal messages. The Investigation also included interviews of certain present and former Company officers and employees as well as personnel from third-party channel partners. The initial scope of the Investigation consisted of invoice samples based upon the sales, payment and returns attributes of the largest channel partners. Following the preliminary findings, however, the scope of the Investigation was expanded to include samples across additional channel partners and sales directly to customers, which include building developers, building owners and property managers. 
 The errors and issues identified by the Investigation include errors and issues in the recognition of revenue resulting primarily from (1) a failure of certain sales personnel in certain cases to disclose relevant terms they had negotiated with channel partners and a failure to identify, consider or properly account for such terms, (2) a failure to consider fully the impact of certain terms of sales agreements with channel partners in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized and (3) a failure to adequately assess collectability. The Investigation also identified errors in certain key performance indicators, including bookings and related metrics. However, to better align its key business metrics with its internal priorities and business plans for 2022 and beyond, the Company ceased presented bookings-related metrics in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022. Accordingly, those metrics should no longer be relied upon. The errors and issues identified by the Investigation occurred at various times throughout the Restated Financial Statement Periods and 2019. 
 Internal Control Considerations 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on (i) the findings of the Investigation, (ii) the Financial Statement Review and (iii) internal control deficiencies that existed as of December 31, 2021, the Company determined there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 in addition to those that existed as of December 31, 2021. As a result, the Company s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. Management has taken steps towards remediating the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. For additional information related to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and the related remedial measures, see Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Form 10-Q, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, and any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described under the section in our 2022 Annual Report, which is being filed concurrently herewith, titled Risk Factors. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, including, without limitation, the following: 
 our ability to remediate the material weaknesses we identified in our internal control over financial reporting and the timing of such remediation; 
 the performance of the Company s stock, particularly given the limited liquidity and depressed trading prices of the Company s common stock as a result of delisting of the Company s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq 
 whether the Company s common stock and warrants, which are trading on OTC Markets Group Inc. s OTC Expert Market (the OTC Expert Market ), may remain on the OTC Expert Market rather than be listed on the OTCQX, OTCQB or OTC Pink markets; 
 developments in the pending stockholder class action and derivative complaints or other legal proceedings, relating to the Investigation and Restatement or otherwise; 
 regulatory disputes and governmental inquiries, including the SEC investigation discussed below; 
 privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches or the loss of data;

 the impact of workforce reductions on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 
 our ability to improve operating and financial results and attain profitability; 
 compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our business; 
 the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, our suppliers and our existing and potential customers; 
 our ability to upgrade and maintain our information technology systems; 
 our ability to acquire and protect intellectual property; 
 our ability to su ccessfully identify, complete, integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions, such as the HDW Acquisition and HelloTech Merger (each as defined below), including the inability to retain key personnel from such acquisitions;

Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. 
 You should read this Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

 As a result of the Business Combination, each share of Legacy Latch redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock was converted into the right to receive approximately shares of the common stock of the Post-Combination Company (the Exchange Ratio ). 
 Based on the following factors, the Company determined under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations , that the Business Combination was a reverse recapitalization. 
 Legacy Latch stockholders owned approximately of the shares in the Post-Combination Company and thus had sufficient voting rights to exert influence over the Post-Combination Company. 
 Legacy Latch appointed a majority of the Post-Combination Company s board of directors and maintained a majority of the composition of management at the time of the transaction. 
 Legacy Latch was the larger entity based on historical revenues and business operations and comprised the ongoing operations of the Post-Combination Company. 
 The Post-Combination Company assumed the name Latch, Inc. 
 The accounting for the transaction was similar to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that goodwill or other intangibles were not recognized, and the transaction was followed by a recapitalization.

 In certain cases, access to software was not transferred to the customers upon execution of the software contract, which is when the revenue had been recognized. For such contracts, software revenue has been restated to reflect the date on which Latch provided access to the customer. In the tables below, the related adjustments are described as access related. 
 Certain software licensing contracts did not meet revenue recognition criteria primarily due to collectability not being reasonably assured. As a result, certain balance sheet accounts, including accounts receivable and deferred revenue, have been restated to correct the amounts associated with such transactions. For certain software license renewals, revenue was recorded in a lump sum instead of over the subscription period. Revenues were restated to record the revenue over the subscription period. The impacts of these adjustments on software revenue are reflected in the tables below as other.

 In addition to the impact of these adjustments on software revenue on the previously reported Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, additional accounts impacted by the Financial Statement Review include: 
 General and administrative; 
 Other income / (expense); 
 Accounts receivable, net; 
 Prepaid expenses and other current assets; 
 Deferred revenue, current; 
 Deferred revenue, non-current; and 
 Retained earnings. 
 3. Internally-developed software 
 The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internally-developed software (including specific software upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional features and functionality). These capitalized costs are primarily related to software that is hosted by the Company and the firmware in the Company s devices. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization of costs ceases upon completion of all substantial testing, at which time amortization of the capitalized software begins. 
 In connection with the Financial Statement Review, the Company determined that, due to flawed operating procedures, the Company did not (i) begin to amortize certain amounts that had been recorded as software-in-development during 2020, 2021 and 2022 when the asset was ready for its intended use or (ii) expense certain amounts when the Company determined that the planned feature was discontinued. The adjustments associated with this correction had a net impact that increased the loss before income taxes by million, million and million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 
 The restated amounts presented in the tables below reflect corrections of internally-developed software, amortization expense and accumulated amortization. 
 The adjustments associated with these corrections impact the following accounts on the previously reported Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: 
 Research and development; 
 Depreciation and amortization; and 
 Internally-developed software, net. 
 4. Stock-based compensation 
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense ratably over the service period. Historically, the Company accelerated a portion of the restricted stock units RSUs fair value at grant date instead of recognizing that amount ratably over the award s requisite service period. The adjustments associated with this correction, along with other stock-based compensation expense corrections, had a net impact that increased the loss before income

million, million and million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The restated amounts presented in the tables below reflect stock-based compensation expense recognized ratably over the service period beginning at the grant date. 
 5. Other corrections 
 In connection with the Financial Statement Review, the Company determined that certain historical amounts did not meet the recognition criteria due to errors in amounts and/or the timing of recognition on the financial statements. The adjustments associated with these corrections had a net impact that increased the loss before income taxes by million, million and million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The restated amounts presented in the tables below reflect amounts in the periods they were incurred.

for electronic components depending on the hardware product, and for mechanical components. The Company determines in its sole discretion whether to replace, repair or refund warrantable devices. The Company determined these warranties are not separate performance obligations as they cannot be purchased separately and do not provide a service in addition to an assurance the hardware will function as expected. The Company records a reserve as a component of cost of hardware revenue based on historical costs of replacement units for returns of defective products. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the reserve recorded for hardware warranties was approximately and , respectively, of cost of hardware revenue. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the reserve recorded for hardware warranties was approximately and , respectively, of cost of hardware revenue. The Company also provides certain customers a right of return for non-defective product, which is treated as a reduction of hardware revenue based on the Company s expectations and historical experience. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the allowance for returns reduced revenue by and million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the allowance for returns reduced revenue by million and million, respectively. 
 Software 
 The Company generates software revenue primarily through the license of its SaaS cloud-based platform to customers on a subscription-based arrangement. Subscription fees vary depending on the features selected by customers as well as the term. SaaS arrangements generally have term lengths of one , two , five or and include a fixed fee generally paid in advance, annually or monthly. When significant discounts were provided to customers on the longer-term software contracts paid in advance, the Company has determined that there is a significant financing component related to the time value of money and therefore has recorded the interest expense in interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The interest expense related to the significant financing component is recorded using the effective interest method, which has higher interest expense at inception and declines over time to match the underlying economics of the transaction. The amount of interest expense related to this component was million and million for the three and

million and million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 
 The SaaS licenses provided by the Company are considered stand-ready performance obligations where customers benefit from the services evenly throughout the service period. Revenue generally is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning when or as control of the promised services is transferred to the customer. 
 Installation Services 
 The Company generates revenues by facilitating hardware installation and activation services. These revenues are recognized over time on a percentage of completion basis. The Company recognized installation services revenue of million and million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 
 Deferred Contract Costs 
 The Company capitalizes commission expenses paid that are incremental to obtaining customer software contracts. Costs related to the initial signing of software contracts are amortized over the average customer life, which has been estimated to be . The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of terms in its customer contracts, including renewals and extensions. Amounts expected to be recognized within of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred contract costs, current and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets; the remaining portion is recorded as deferred contract costs, non-current and is included in other non-current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which, together with subsequent amendments, amends the requirement on the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company determined that available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable and contract assets are the applicable financial assets that are subject to this ASU and adopted the guidance on January 1, 2022. The Company modified the impairment model related to the available-for-sale securities from the other-than-temporary impairment model to the current expected credit losses model and determined that an allowance for credit loss is not needed as of January 1, 2022 based on various factors, including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and forecasted economic data. The Company adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the accumulated deficit on January 1, 2022. 
 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740. The update also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendment in this update was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2021. The Company has completed its assessment of this ASU and determined that it does not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Investments that are impaired are those that are considered to have losses that are other-than-temporary. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include: 
 the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; 
 the financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee; and 
 whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery. 
 As of June 30, 2022, the Company had not identified any impairment indicators in its investments. 
 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company received million and million, respectively, of proceeds from maturities and call redemptions. The Company received million and million of proceeds from sales of money market funds, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company recorded minimal realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities. Gains and losses are determined using the first-in first-out method.

million. In November 2021 and March 2022, the Company executed additional convertible promissory notes in the amounts of million and million, respectively, under the same terms as the initial Note (collectively referred to as the Notes ). The outstanding principal of the Notes, together with unpaid and accrued interest, was originally due and payable on September 30, 2022. The maturity date was extended to November 15, 2022. The Notes contained certain embedded features, including: acceleration in the event of default; automatic conversion into the equity of the counterparty upon a subsequent equity financing by the counterparty; optional conversion into equity upon the sale of preferred stock by the counterparty; and optional acceleration or conversion into equity upon certain corporate transactions by the counterparty. Interest accrued at per annum. The Notes met the definition of a debt security under the provisions of ASC 320, Investments - Debt Securities . 
 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a loss on the Notes of million and million, respectively. The Company did not have Level 3 investments during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The change in fair value of the Notes is recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of June 30, 2022, the fair value of the Notes was million and classified as trading securities and presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Money market funds Total cash and cash equivalents Available-for-sale securities Trading securities Total assets Liabilities Warrant liability Total liabilities 
 The Company s investments in money market funds backed by U.S. government securities have been classified as Level 1 as they are valued utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. Investments in asset-backed securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency debt securities have been classified as Level 2 as they are valued using quoted prices in less active markets or other directly or indirectly observable inputs. Fair values of corporate bonds and U.S. government agency debt securities were derived from a consensus or weighted-average price based on input of market prices from multiple sources for the reporting period. With regard to commercial paper, all of the securities had high credit ratings and one year or less to maturity; therefore, fair value was derived from accretion of purchase price to face value over the term of maturity or quoted market prices for similar instruments if available. 
 The Company s investments in the Notes were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they relied significantly on inputs that are unobservable in the market. The conversion price was dependent on varying events and equity value and therefore has been estimated using a Monte Carlo model to simulate the various future events. Significant assumptions included: (i) the timing and amount of a subsequent equity financing, if any; (ii) the equity value of the counterparty as of June 30, 2022; (iii) once converted into equity, the timing of any liquidity event; (iv) the counterparty undergoing a dissolution if the new equity financing did not occur before the maturity of the Notes; and (v) an assumed recovery rate in a dissolution event. The Notes were measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model at each measurement date. The Company elected to apply the fair value option and account for the hybrid instrument containing the Notes and the embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument, with any subsequent changes in fair value being reported in earnings. 
 As of June 30, 2022, Level 3 fair value measurement inputs were (i) volatility, ; (ii) risk free rate, U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Yields, and (iii) term, years. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, there were no transfers of financial assets between Level 1 and Level 2. 
 The Company s warrant liability includes private placement warrants that were originally issued in connection with the TSIA IPO that Legacy Latch assumed as part of the Closing of the Business Combination (the Private Placement Warrants ). The Private Placement Warrants are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. This valuation is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each re-measurement, the valuation will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Private Placement Warrants are held by a single holder. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , indicates that the fair value should be determined from the perspective of a market participant that holds the identical item and use the quoted price in an active market held by another party, if that price is available. As the only market for the transfer of the Private Placement Warrants is the public market, the Company has determined that the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants at a specific date is determined by the closing price of the Company s public warrants, traded under the symbol LTCHW, and within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The closing price of the public warrants was and as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was million and million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

 Registration Rights Agreement 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and certain stockholders of Legacy Latch and TSIA entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the 2021 Registration Rights Agreement ). Pursuant to the 2021 Registration Rights Agreement, in June 2021, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with respect to the registrable securities under the 2021 Registration Rights Agreement.

The Company also agreed to provide certain demand and piggyback registration rights. The 2021 Registration Rights Agreement also provides that the Company pays certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnifies the stockholders against certain liabilities. The Company bears the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. The 2021 Registration Rights Agreement does not provide for any penalties connected with delays in registering the Company s common stock. 
 Legal Contingencies 
 Securities Litigation 
 On August 31, 2022, an alleged stockholder of Latch stock filed a purported securities class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Brennan v. Latch, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-07473, the Brennan Action ). The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its former officers violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements regarding the Company s business, operations and prospects. The complaint includes claims for damages, including interest, and an award of reasonable costs and attorneys fees and expert fees to the putative class. On January 17, 2023, the court appointed VB PTC Establishment as Trustee of Gersec Trust as lead plaintiff. On November 12, 2024, the Company and lead plaintiff filed with the court a settlement agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay the settlement class in the amount of million in exchange for the dismissal of all claims against the defendants (including the Company). The settlement remains subject to approval by the court, and a preliminary hearing has been set for January 16, 2025. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the defendants (including the Company) continue to deny any liability or wrongdoing. Latch does not expect insurers to contribute to the settlement amount. Because the complaint was filed in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the amount of the proposed settlement is not reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 On January 11, 2023, an alleged stockholder of Latch stock filed a purported securities class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Schwartz v. Latch, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-00027, the Schwartz Action ). The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its current and former directors violated Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act by making false or misleading statements regarding the Company s business, operations and prospects. The complaint includes claims for damages, including interest, and an award of reasonable costs and attorneys fees and expert fees to the putative class. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to this action. The Company does not believe the allegations are meritorious and intends to vigorously defend against them. On April 24, 2023, the court appointed Scott Schwartz as lead plaintiff. In May 2023, the parties agreed to stay the action pending completion of the Restatement, and to allow the lead plaintiff a period of 21 days following completion of the Restatement in which to file an amended complaint. On September 27, 2024, the Company filed a motion to transfer the complaint to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The motion was denied on November 13, 2024. In December 2024, the parties agreed in principle to a settlement and entered into a binding memorandum of understanding pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay the settlement class in the amount of million in exchange for the dismissal of all claims against the defendants (including the Company). The settlement remains subject to a final stipulation of settlement and approval by the court.

 (in thousands, except share and per share data) 

million in exchange for the dismissal of all claims against the defendants and the Company. The settlement remains subject to approval by the court. Latch and TS Innovation Acquisitions Sponsor, LLC agreed to share the costs of the settlement amount equally. Latch expects insurers to pay million of Latch s million share of the settlement amount. Because the complaints were filed in 2023, neither the amount of the proposed settlement nor any expected insurance contributions are reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Derivative Litigation 
 On February 15 and July 13, 2023, two alleged stockholders of Latch stock filed derivative actions purportedly on behalf of Latch in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York: Manley v. Latch, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-01273 (the Manley Action and Gottlieb v. Latch, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-07473 (the Gottlieb Action ). The complaints generally allege that that certain directors and former officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties and violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements regarding the Company s business, operations and prospects. Both complaints seek orders permitting plaintiffs to maintain each action derivatively on behalf of the Company, awarding unspecified damages allegedly sustained by the Company, awarding restitution from the individual defendants, requiring the Company to make certain reforms to its corporate governance and controls and awarding costs and attorneys fees. The Gottlieb Action includes additional claims for unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and contribution against certain individual defendants named in the Brennan Action and Schwartz Action. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to these actions. The Company does not believe the allegations are meritorious and intends to vigorously defend against them. On August 1, 2023, the court consolidated the Manley Action and Gottlieb Action under the caption In re Latch Inc. Derivative Litigation, Case No. 1:23-cv-01273. The parties agreed to stay the action until 21 days following the resolution of any and all motions to dismiss both the Brennan Action and the Schwartz Action. 
 Service Provider Demand 
 The Company is in discussions with a service provider related to a demand for payment under a prior agreement. The Company does not believe that the service provider is entitled to any fees under the prior agreement. However, the Company believes it is probable that an agreement with the service provider will be reached and that the amount the Company will pay the service provider in connection with the dispute and the resolution thereof can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued approximately million in connection with the dispute. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that this potential exposure may change based on the resolution of the ongoing discussions. No legal proceedings have been initiated with respect to this demand for payment or the prior agreement with the service provider. 
 SEC Investigation 
 In March 2023, the staff of the SEC (the SEC Staff requested a meeting with the Company s outside counsel to discuss the findings of the Investigation and related matters (the SEC Investigation ). The SEC Staff also asked that the Company voluntarily provide certain documents in advance of the meeting, which the Company did. In April 2023, outside counsel and advisors conducted an initial meeting with the SEC Staff to discuss the findings of the Investigation. In August 2023, the SEC Staff requested the Company voluntarily provide additional documents and information relating to the Investigation and related matters. The Company has continued to communicate with the SEC Staff, and the Company has continued to

The Company accounts for warrants as required under ASC 815 and has concluded that equity classification would be met for the public warrants as the Company has a single class of equity, and thus all holders vote on all matters submitted to the Company s stockholders and receive the same form of consideration in the event of a change of control (thus qualifying for the exception to the net cash settlement model), and the other conditions of equity classification would be met.

 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company s effective tax rate was different from the U.S. federal statutory rate. This difference is primarily attributable to the effect of state and local income taxes and permanent differences between expenses deductible for financial reporting purposes offset by the valuation allowances placed on the Company s deferred tax assets. 
 As of June 30, 2022, liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be recorded by the Company. Management does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
 To date, the Company has incurred cumulative net losses and maintains a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets as the Company has determined that it is more than likely than not that these assets will not be fully realized.

 Stock Incentive Plans 
 In January 2016, Legacy Latch adopted the Latch, Inc. 2016 Stock Plan (the 2016 Plan and, together with the Latchable, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the Prior Plans ).

Stock options under the 2016 Plan were granted with an exercise price equal to the stock s fair market value at the grant date. Stock options outstanding under the 2016 Plan generally have terms and vest over a period starting from the date specified in each award agreement. Since the effectiveness of the 2021 Plan, no additional awards have been or will be granted under the 2016 Plan.

In connection with the May 2022 RIF, the Company modified the option and RSU awards of approximately employees to accelerate the vesting of unvested RSUs that were improbable of vesting as of the modification date. The modification was treated as a Type III modification in accordance with ASC 718, which is accounted for as the cancellation of the original award and the issuance of a new award under the modified terms. This led to the reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense amounting to million, offset by the fair value of the new award of million as of the modification date, resulting in a net reversal of million to the share-based compensation expense.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of Latch, Inc. and its subsidiaries included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section captioned Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report filed concurrently herewith, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this subsection to we, our, Latch and the Company refer to the business and operations of Latch Systems, Inc. (formerly known as Latch, Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination and to Latch, Inc. (formerly known as TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp.) and its consolidated subsidiaries following the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 Restatement of Prior Financial Information 
 The Company has restated certain of its historical financial statements and financial information. See the Explanatory Note above and Note 2. Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements and Information in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 Latch is a technology company primarily serving the multifamily rental home market segment of the smart building industry deploying hardware and software technology to digitize otherwise manual processes, including building and unit access and in-unit device control. 
 We combine hardware, software and services into a system that enables smart access for users of a multifamily building, enabling easier, more modernized experiences for residents and visitors, more efficient operations for building owners and property managers and more convenient interaction for service providers. We designed and developed a cloud-based software-as-a-service SaaS platform (the Latch Platform to address the access requirements of modern multifamily buildings. Our customers include real estate developers, builders, building owners and property managers in the multifamily market segment in the United States and Canada. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our future success is dependent on many factors, including those further discussed below. While these areas represent opportunities for Latch, they also represent challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to operate and grow our business. 
 Evolving our go-to-market strategy. Our performance is dependent on evolving our go-to-market strategy to address the needs of our customers and facilitate efficient internal motions. We must continue to develop a go-to-market strategy that scales and allows higher sales volumes at lower incremental costs. Our ability to generate operating profits and grow our business depends, in part, on the success of our go-to-market strategy. 
 Investing in research and development R D and enhancing our customer experience . Our performance is dependent on the investments we make in research and development, including our ability to attract and retain highly skilled research and development personnel. We believe we must continually develop and introduce innovative new hardware products, software applications and other offerings. If we fail to innovate and enhance our brand and our products, our market position and revenue will likely be adversely affected. 
 Category adoption, expansion of our total addressable market and market growth . Our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of hardware and software products that improve resident experience and the growth of this market. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 In the first quarter of 2022, to align our key business metrics with our internal priorities and business plans at the time, we reported two key business metrics: Annual Recurring Revenue ARR and Spaces. Since that time, the Company has undergone significant changes, including fundamental organizational and management changes and the consummation of the HDW Acquisition and HelloTech Merger. In light of these significant organizational and management changes, we do not believe ARR or Spaces, as defined and presented in the first quarter of 2022, represent key business metrics for the Company 
 52 

at the time of this Form 10-Q. Accordingly, we are not presenting those metrics in this Form 10-Q. We are continuing to present software revenue (prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP )), total revenue (GAAP), net loss (GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) as key business metrics, as we believe each of those metrics is important in measuring our performance, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions that will impact our future operational results. 
 Our key business metrics are as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):

 (a) Percentage changes represented with parentheses represent unfavorable changes. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented in this Form 10-Q Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, restructuring, non-ordinary course legal fees and settlement reserves, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative instruments, warrant liabilities and trading securities and transaction-related expenses. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss. We believe excluding the impact of these items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance. We monitor, and have presented in this Form 10-Q, Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we include in net loss. Accordingly, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors, analysts and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from 
 53 

the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. 
 In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):

 (a) As a result of significant discounts provided to our customers on certain long-term software contracts paid in advance, the Company has determined that there is a significant financing component related to the time value of money and has therefore broken out the interest component and recorded it as a component of interest expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
 Interest expense associated with the significant financing component included in interest (income) expense, net was 1.4 million and 2.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and 0.7 million and 1.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. 
 (b) Restructuring costs related to the May 2022 reduction in force (the May RIF ). 
 (c) Transaction costs related to the Business Combination. These costs are included in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
 (d) Non-ordinary course legal fees and settlement reserves incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and disputes, including 6.8 million related to an estimated liability recorded in connection with a dispute with a service provider during the year ended December 31, 2021. While the Company is involved in various litigation and legal disputes in the ordinary course of its business, the Company believes the non-ordinary course legal fees and settlement reserves included in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA do not represent normal and recurring operating expenses. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies , in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements . These costs are included within general and administrative within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
 (e) See Note 13. Stock-Based Compensation , in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements for details. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 
 Hardware Revenue . We generate hardware revenue primarily from the sale of our portfolio of devices for our smart access and smart apartment solutions. We sell hardware to customers, which include real estate developers, builders, building owners and property managers, directly or through our channel partners, who act as intermediaries, installers or wholesalers. The Company recognizes hardware revenue when there is evidence a contract exists and control has been transferred to the customer. The Company provides warranties that its hardware will be substantially free from defects in materials and 
 54 

workmanship for a period of one or two years for electronic components depending on the hardware product, and five years for mechanical components. The Company determines in its sole discretion whether to replace, repair or refund warrantable devices. 
 From time-to-time, industry-wide supply chain disruptions have created shortages of certain construction materials and other products. Additionally, our customers have also experienced trade labor availability constraints and delays. These factors have caused our customers to experience construction delays, which have and may continue to delay the timing of the installation of our products and our recognition of hardware and software revenue. 
 Software Revenue . We generate software revenue primarily through the license of our SaaS over our cloud-based platform on a subscription-based arrangement. Subscription fees vary depending on the features selected by customers. SaaS arrangements generally have term lengths between one and ten years. The SaaS provided by the Company are considered stand-ready performance obligations where customers benefit from the services evenly throughout the service period. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning when or as control of the promised services is transferred to the customer. 
 Installation Services Revenue . We generate revenue by facilitating hardware installation and activation services to select customers. This revenue is recognized over time on a percentage of completion basis. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of hardware revenue consists primarily of product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging costs, warranty costs, assembly costs and warehousing costs, as well as other non-inventoriable costs, including personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics and direct deployment and outsourced labor costs. We expect hardware cost of revenue to move in-line with our hardware revenue. Our hardware costs have been and may continue to be impacted by any supply chain constraints, shipping cost volatility and changes in import tariffs. 
 Cost of software revenue consists primarily of outsourced hosting costs, other outsourced cloud-based service costs and personnel-related expenses associated with monitoring and managing outsourced hosting service providers. 
 Cost of installation services revenue consists primarily of third-party installation labor costs, parts and materials and personnel-related expenses associated with deployment of our hardware. 
 Cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization shown in operating expenses. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
 R D Expenses . R D expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product, design and engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, travel and stock-based compensation. Also included are non-personnel costs such as amounts paid to our third-party contract manufacturers for tooling, engineering and prototype costs of our hardware products, fees paid to third-party consultants, R D supplies and rent. We expect our R D expenses to decrease for 2023 as a result of restructuring initiatives, including the May RIF, the August 2022 reduction in force (together with the May RIF, the 2022 RIFs and the July 2023 reduction in force (the July 2023 RIF ). 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses . Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our sales, customer success, deployment and marketing teams, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, travel, commissions and stock-based compensation. Also included are non-personnel costs such as marketing activities (trade shows and events, conferences and digital advertising), professional fees, rent and customer support. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease for 2023 as a result of restructuring initiatives, including the 2022 RIFs and the July 2023 RIF. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our executive, legal, human resources, finance and IT functions, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, travel and stock-based compensation. Additional expenses included in this category are non-personnel costs such as 
 55 

legal fees, rent, professional fees, audit fees, bad debt expense and insurance costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase at least through 2024, due to professional services costs related to the Investigation, the SEC Investigation, the Restatement and remediation activities. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses . Depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation expenses related to investments in property and equipment and internally-developed capitalized software. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists of interest expense associated with the significant financing component of our longer-term software contracts, interest expense associated with our previous debt financing arrangements, interest income on highly liquid short-term investments, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt and gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities, warrant liabilities and trading securities. 
 Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to state and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized. 
 56

Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 3.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by increases of 1.6 million in software revenue and 1.7 million in installation services revenue partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in hardware revenue. Increased software revenue reflects an increase in building software access provided to customers. The increase in installation services revenue is due to it being a new offering released in the second quarter of 2021 and the expansion of the offering. The decrease in hardware revenue is primarily attributable to decreased hardware deliveries recognized. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased by 6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in cost of hardware revenue of 5.0 million, driven by a 2.9 million reserve for non-cancellable purchase commitments. The increase in cost of installation services revenue of 1.2 million reflects increased facilitation of installations. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased by 9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) 7.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, comprised of 4.2 million of increased compensation expenses and 3.2 million of increased stock-based compensation due to increased headcount to invest in expanding the functionality of our Latch Platform, net of a reduction in connection with the May RIF; (ii) restructuring costs of 1.3 million related to the May RIF; (iii) 0.5 million increase in software license expense and (iv) 0.4 million increase in development costs related to new product development. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 11.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) 5.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses comprised of 3.7 million in increased compensation expenses due to expansion of our sales force and demand generation team, partially offset by the May RIF, and a 1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation; (ii) restructuring costs of 4.4 million related to the May RIF; (iii) 0.9 million increase in marketing expense; (iv) 0.7 million increase in software license expense; (v) 0.4 million increase in travel expenses and (vi) 0.1 million increase in professional fees related to outsourced brand and website refresh initiatives. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) 3.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, comprised of 1.5 million in increased stock-based compensation and 1.7 million in increased compensation expenses driven by increased headcount related to public company operational requirements; (ii) 0.7 million increase in public company insurance expense and (iii) restructuring costs of 0.6 million related to the May RIF. These increases were partially offset by a 2.8 million decrease in professional and consulting fees related to the occurrence of the Business Combination in 2021. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the increased amortization of capitalized internally-developed software. 
 Total Other Expense, net 
 Total other expense, net increased by 17.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) a 9.0 million favorable change in other income related to the extinguishment of derivatives in June 2021 as part of the Business Combination; (ii) a greater decrease in the price of our common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2022 than during the three months ended June 30, 2021, which resulted in a 7.5 million period-over-period decrease in the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants liability during these periods; (iii) a 1.5 million favorable change on the extinguishment of debt due to the extinguishment of debt in June 2021 as part of the Business Combination and (iv) a 1.6 million decrease in interest expense primarily related to the 
 58 

conversion of the Convertible Notes and the repayment of the term loan in June 2021 as part of the Business Combination. These increases were partially offset by a 2.5 million unfavorable change in fair value of trading securities driven by increasing interest rates.

Comparison of six months ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 11.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by a 5.6 million increase in hardware revenue, 3.3 million increase in installation services revenue and 2.8 million increase in software revenue. Increased hardware revenue was primarily driven by increased hardware deliveries recognized. Increased software revenue reflects an increase in building software access provided to customers. The increase in installation services revenue is due to it being a new offering released in the second quarter of 2021 and the expansion of the offering. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased by 15.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by a 12.0 million increase in cost of hardware revenue and 3.0 million increase in cost of installation services revenue. The increase in cost of hardware revenue was driven by (i) a 3.6 million reserve for non-cancellable purchase commitments and (ii) an increase in cost of hardware revenue driven by increased hardware installation. The increase in cost of installation services revenue reflects increased facilitation of installations. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased by 18.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) 15.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses, comprised of 11.2 million of increased compensation expenses and 3.8 million of increased stock-based compensation due to increased headcount to invest in expanding the functionality of the Latch Platform, net of a reduction in connection with the May RIF; (ii) restructuring costs of 1.3 million related to the May RIF; (iii) 1.1 million increase in software license expense and (iv) 0.9 million increase in development costs related to new product development. 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 25.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) 15.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses, comprised of 11.9 million of increased compensation expenses and 3.8 million of increased stock-based compensation due to expansion of our sales force and demand generation team, partially offset by the May RIF; (ii) restructuring costs of 4.4 million in 2022 related to the May RIF; (iii) 2.2 million increase in marketing expense; (iv) 1.4 million increase in software license expense; (v) 1.1 million increase in travel expenses and (vi) 0.5 million increase in professional fees related to outsourced brand and website refresh initiatives. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 3.8 million decrease in professional and consulting fees related to the occurrence of the Business Combination in 2021. This decrease was partially offset by (i) 0.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, comprised of 4.1 million in increased compensation expenses driven by increased headcount related to public company operational requirements partially offset by a 3.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of a non-recurring stock-based compensation charge incurred in the first quarter of 2021 in connection with the sale of shares to investors by certain Company employees and non-employee service providers; (ii) 1.8 million increase in public company insurance expense; (iii) restructuring costs of 0.6 million related to the May RIF and (iv) 0.1 million increase in taxes and license fees. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the increased amortization of capitalized internally-developed software. 
 
 61 

Total Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Total other income (expense), net increased by 30.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to: (i) a greater decrease in the price of our common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2022 than during the six months ended June 30, 2021, which resulted in a 13.8 million period-over-period decrease in the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants liability during these periods; (ii) a 12.5 million favorable change in other income related to the extinguishment of derivatives in June 2021 as part of the Business Combination; (iii) a 4.1 million decrease in interest expense primarily related to the conversion of the Convertible Notes and the repayment of the term loan in June 2021 as part of the Business Combination and (iv) a 1.5 million favorable change on the extinguishment of debt due to the extinguishment of debt in June 2021 as part of the Business Combination. These increases were partially offset by a 1.5 million unfavorable change in fair value of trading securities driven by increasing interest rates. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred losses since our inception. As of June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2024, the Company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and current and non-current available-for-sale securities were approximately 288.0 million, and 91.4 million, respectively. The Company s available-for-sale securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. 
 Historically , our short-term liquidity needs have primarily included working capital for salaries, including sales and marketing and research and development as well as component inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers. 
 To better align staffing and expense levels with sales volumes and the macroeconomic environment and create operating efficiencies, we incurred 6.2 million in restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2022 related to the May RIF (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation). In 2023, we conducted the July 2023 RIF in order to further streamline our business operations, reduce costs and complexities in the business and create additional operating efficiencies. 
 Beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and continuing through 2024, we incurred, and may continue to incur, significant professional fees primarily consisting of legal, forensic accounting, management consulting and related advisory services as a result of the Investigation and the SEC Investigation, as well as accounting related consulting services, independent registered accounting firm fees and advisory services related to the Restatement and our Financial Statement Review. Additionally, we have incurred significant costs in connection with various pending litigation. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies , in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. Such litigation involves significant defense and other costs and, if decided adversely to us or settled, could result in significant monetary damages or expenditures. Although we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us. 
 
 In connection with the HDW Acquisition, in July 2023 the Company issued to HDW s stockholders as merger consideration 22.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Promissory Notes. The Promissory Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest at a rate of 10 per annum and were scheduled to mature on July 3, 2025, unless earlier accelerated in connection with an event of default (including certain events of delisting from Nasdaq) or change of control of the Company. On April 26, 2024, the Company repaid the Promissory Notes in full without penalty. The Company paid an aggregate of 23.9 million in principal and accrued interest to the holders of the Promissory Notes. 
 
 We contract with third-parties to manufacture our products. During the normal course of business, we and our contract manufacturers procure components based upon a demand plan. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we materially reduced our original demand plan and started engaging in discussions with our contract manufacturers regarding our obligation to purchase the inventory based on our original demand plan. In 2022, we purchased and received excess inventory for certain products based on our original demand plan. Additionally, as a result of these discussions, we agreed to prepay certain contract manufacturers approximately 12.3 million for material and component obligations. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had unfunded non-cancellable purchase commitments of approximately 26.3 million. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our business plans, our levels of revenue, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, market acceptance of our products, the results of business initiatives, the timing of new product introductions and overall economic conditions. 
 62 

Based on our current business plan, we expect to be able to use our current cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities to fund our operational cash requirements for at least one year from the date of this Form 10-Q. 
 Other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures and acquisitions. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies, in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements . 
 
 Indebtedness 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On July 1, 2021, the Company executed a new revolving credit facility replacing the matured facility with a freight forwarding and customs brokerage company. The revolving credit facility, which was subsequently amended in May 2022, had a credit limit of 6.0 million with no stated maturity date. Installment plan agreements were executed for each financing request, which included the interest rate. The revolving credit facility had no financial or other covenants. As of June 30, 2022, 0.2 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, which the Company cancelled in January 2023. 
 Promissory Notes 
 As discussed above, in July 2023 in connection with the HDW Acquisition, the Company issued to HDW s stockholders as merger consideration 22.0 million aggregate principal amount of Promissory Notes. The Promissory Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest at a rate of 10 per annum and were scheduled to mature on July 3, 2025, unless earlier accelerated in connection with an event of default (including certain events of delisting from Nasdaq) or change of control of the Company. On April 26, 2024, the Company repaid the Promissory Notes in full without penalty. The Company paid an aggregate of 23.9 million in principal and accrued interest to the holders of the Promissory Notes. 
 
 Term Loan with Customers Bank 
 Following the closing of the HelloTech Merger, on July 15, 2024, Latch Systems and HelloTech, as the Borrowers, entered into the Loan Agreement with Customers Bank. 
 Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, Customers Bank issued the Borrowers the New Loan, a term loan in the principal amount of 6.0 million. The Loan Agreement did not result in the Borrowers receiving any additional loan proceeds. Interest is payable on the New Loan at a rate equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal or (b) 6.0 , and the Maturity Date is July 15, 2029. 
 The Borrowers are required to pay interest on the New Loan monthly until January 15, 2025. Thereafter, the Borrowers are required to pay equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest until the Maturity Date. There is no penalty for prepayment of the New Loan. 
 Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers have granted Customers Bank security interests in substantially all of the Borrowers assets, other than intellectual property. HelloTech is required to maintain an operating account with Customers with a sufficient balance to support monthly payments. Additionally, the Borrowers are collectively required to maintain a liquidity ratio of at least 4.00, tested monthly, which is calculated as the quotient of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations with respect to cash of foreign subsidiaries), divided by all outstanding indebtedness owed to Customers Bank. 
 The Loan Agreement contains various covenants that, among other things, limit the Borrowers ability to: 
 engage in certain asset dispositions; 
 permit a change in control; 
 merge or consolidate; 
 incur indebtedness or grant liens on its assets; 
 declare or pay dividends, distributions or redemptions; 
 make loans or investments; and 
 engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
 
 63 

If an event of default exists under the Loan Agreement, Customers Bank will be able to accelerate the maturity of the New Loan and exercise other rights and remedies. Events of default include, but are not limited to, the following events: 
 
 failure to pay any principal or interest within three business days of the due date; 
 failure to perform or otherwise comply with the covenants and obligations in the Loan Agreement, subject, in certain instances, to certain grace periods; 
 bankruptcy or insolvency events involving the Borrowers; or 
 the rendering of judgments against a Borrower that remain undischarged, unvacated, unbonded, unsatisfied or unstayed for a certain period. 

Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 Six months ended June 30, 2022 2021 
 (restated) 
 Net cash used in operating activities 
 (83,464) (33,187) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 44,883 (4,040) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities 
 (5,596) 448,702 Effect of exchange rates on cash 
 (7) (5) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 
 (44,184) 411,470 
 Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 increased by 50.3 million compared to June 30, 2021 primarily as a result of an increase in net loss, after adjusting for non-cash items of 40.3 million, an increase in inventories, net at June 30, 2022 of 12.6 million compared to June 30, 2021, an increase in other non-current assets of 0.7 million and an increase of 4.0 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets. These increases were offset by a 3.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to revenue recognition differing from the timing of billing to customers, a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of 2.8 million at June 30, 2022 compared to the prior year, and a net increase in accounts receivable collections of 1.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities increased by 48.9 million to 44.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from 4.0 million of net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to proceeds from the sales or maturities of available-for-sale securities of 95.4 million, partially offset by an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities of 44.5 million and higher capitalization of internally developed software costs reflecting increased headcount as well as incremental new functionality being added to our Latch Platform for future product releases. 
 Financing Activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 454.3 million primarily due to net proceeds of 450.0 million from the Business Combination for the six months ended June 30, 2021, a 3.9 million net repayment of our Revolving Facility in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 3.2 million of payments for tax withholding on net settlements of restricted stock units RSUs ), partially offset by the 5.0 million repayment of the term loan in June 2021. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 that had, or were reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report filed concurrently herewith. 
 64 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements for information about recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Background 
 As described more fully in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-Q, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of matters relating to the Company s key performance indicators and revenue recognition practices for certain transactions, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related to such transactions. 
 As a result of the accounting, financial reporting and internal control deficiencies identified by the Investigation and their material impact on the Company s current and historical financial statements and related disclosures, the Audit Committee determined that the Company s financial statements for 2019, 2020, 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 would be restated. Following the Investigation, the Company completed a comprehensive review of its previously issued financial statements. As a result, the Company restated those financial statements to correct the errors identified. As further detailed below, the Company identified errors related to, among other items: (i) revenue recognition on hardware and software sales, (ii) revenue recognition and billing on software licenses, (iii) recognition of various expenses, (iv) internally developed software, (v) stock based compensation and (vi) errors in certain key performance indicators, including bookings and related metrics. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our current management, including our interim CEO and interim CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, in connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our interim CEO and interim CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2022 because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. 
 Notwithstanding that conclusion, based on review, analysis and inquiries conducted subsequent to June 30, 2022, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with GAAP. 
 Previously Disclosed Material Weakness 
 In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified a material weakness related to the selection and development of control activities, including over information technology related to certain account balances (the 2021 Material Weakness ). During 2021 and 2022, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, the Company began implementing a remediation plan to address the 2021 Material Weakness. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company completed the May 2022 RIF that impacted approximately 130 employees or approximately 26 of the Company s full-time employees. The Company also experienced management changes, including the March 2022 transition of the Company s Chief Financial Officer. We believe these personnel changes hindered our ability to fully remediate the 2021 Material Weakness and contributed to additional material weaknesses identified as of June 30, 2022. 
 While we believe that our efforts described below have improved our internal control over financial reporting, further validation and testing of the design and effectiveness of the relevant internal controls over a sustained period is necessary before we can determine whether the 2021 Material Weakness has been remediated. 
 65 

Material Weaknesses Identified 
 As noted above, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 The Company did not maintain controls to execute the criteria established in the COSO Framework for (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication and (v) monitoring activities. 
 Each of the control deficiencies identified below constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate. 
 Control Environment. The Company did not maintain an effective control environment and identified the following material weaknesses: (i) the tone from executive management was insufficient to create the proper environment for effective internal control over financial reporting; and (ii) the Company lacked appropriate policies and resources to develop and operate effective internal control over financial reporting, which contributed to the Company s inability to properly analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. 
 These control environment material weaknesses also contributed to the other material weaknesses identified below. 
 Risk Assessment. The Company did not design and implement an effective risk assessment and identified a material weakness relating to: (i) identifying, assessing, and communicating appropriate objectives, (ii) identifying and analyzing risks to achieve these objectives, and (iii) identifying and assessing changes in the business that could impact the system of internal controls. 
 
 Control Activities. The Company did not design and implement effective control activities and identified the following material weaknesses, which are in addition to the 2021 Material Weakness: 
 
 Ineffective design and operation of certain control activities to respond to potential risks of material misstatement of revenue. In particular, the Company failed to: (i) ensure that relevant terms sales representatives had negotiated with customers were identified and communicated to the accounting department, resulting in a failure to properly account for such terms, (ii) fully consider the impact of certain terms of sales agreements on the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized and (iii) identify and account for extended payment terms. As a result of these control design deficiencies, the policies and controls related to revenue recognition were not effective in ensuring that (a) revenue was recorded at the correct amount and in the correct period and (b) the accounting department was informed of all elements and deliverables of certain arrangements. These design deficiencies led to inaccuracies in amounts and timing of revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts that contributed to material accounting errors in 2022 and prior years. 
 Ineffective design and operation of certain control activities due to the significant 2022 personnel changes discussed above. Control deficiencies, which aggregate to a material weakness, occurred within the following areas: order to cash, inventory, financial close, sales commissions, procure-to-pay, capitalized software and information and technology general controls. 
 
 Information and Communication. The Company did not design and implement effective information and communication activities and identified the following material weakness: the Company did not have adequate processes and controls for communicating information among the accounting, finance and sales departments, including the customer success team, necessary to support the proper functioning of internal controls impacting revenue-related accounts. 
 
 Monitoring Activities. The Company did not design and implement effective monitoring activities and identified the following material weaknesses: (i) failure to adequately monitor compliance with accounting policies, procedures and controls related to revenue recognition, including accounts receivable and reserves; and (ii) failure to properly select, develop and perform ongoing evaluations of various components of internal controls. 
 These material weaknesses described in the paragraphs above contributed to material accounting errors identified and corrected as indicated in the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. If we fail to adequately remediate these material weaknesses, there could be additional material misstatements that may not be prevented or detected. 
 Remediation Plan and Status. The Company is committed to remediating the material weaknesses identified above, fostering continuous improvement in internal controls and enhancing its overall internal control environment. Since identifying the above material weaknesses, the Company has corrected the errors in the financial statements for 2022 and prior and has 
 66 

begun implementing the remediation activities described below. The Company believes that these activities, when fully implemented, should remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. These remediation efforts remain ongoing, and additional remediation initiatives may be necessary. 
 A material weakness cannot be considered completely remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time such that management can conclude, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. If not remediated, material weaknesses or control deficiencies could result in further material misstatements. 
 Accordingly, as management continues to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, the Company will continue to perform additional procedures prescribed by management, including the use of certain manual mitigating control procedures and the employment of additional tools and resources deemed necessary, to ensure that our future consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in all material respects. The following remediation activities highlight the Company s commitment to remediating the identified material weaknesses: 
 In January 2023, appointed an interim Chief Executive Officer and an interim Chief Financial Officer to improve tone from executive management, reinforce our commitment to integrity and promote accurate record keeping, ethical values and proper business practices. We also undertook various personnel changes, including voluntary and involuntary terminations within the Company s sales and finance departments. 
 In June and July 2023, established a new leadership team and transitioned to a St. Louis-based, in-person, sales department. All remaining remotely working salespersons were terminated as part of this new strategy. As of July 2023, substantially all of the sales and accounting department members were co-located in our St. Louis office. 
 Hired finance and accounting professionals with the appropriate level of experience and training necessary to develop, maintain and improve our accounting policies, procedures and internal controls and continue to hire other qualified finance and accounting professionals. 
 Provided, and continue to provide, training for employees regarding their responsibilities related to the performance or oversight of internal controls. 
 Reinforced the importance of communication between the sales, accounting and finance departments regarding key terms of, and changes or modifications to, sales transactions, including by establishing controls requiring finance department approval of certain non-standard terms. 
 Updated operative sales contracts to clarify that no transactional terms exist outside of the signed agreements and no oral agreements are valid and enforceable. 
 Developed an intranet for employees to reference, which includes an organizational chart and access to Company-wide policies and other resources, including the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Whistleblower Policy and access information for our anonymous reporting hotline. 
 Began implementation of a process to reevaluate, revise and improve our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance program, including governance, risk assessment, testing methodologies and corrective action. The Company plans to enhance our risk assessment procedures and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment with a particular focus on the issues identified in the Investigation.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are and may become, from time to time, involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including governmental and administrative investigations, inquiries and proceedings concerning employment, labor, environmental and other claims. Although management is unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any legal action, management believes the ultimate liability arising from such actions, individually and in the aggregate, which existed at June 30, 2022, will not materially affect the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as set forth in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies , in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements. Given the inherent unpredictability of these types of proceedings, however, it is possible that future adverse outcomes could have a material effect on our financial results. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Annual Report filed concurrently herewith. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 (c) Insider Adoption or Termination of Trading Arrangements
