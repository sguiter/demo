 Concentration of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We place our cash equivalents and short-term investments only in highly rated financial instruments and in United States government instruments. 
 Our accounts receivable and contract assets are derived principally from patent license and technology solutions agreements. Four licensees comprised and of our accounts receivable balances of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our licensees, who generally include large, multinational, wireless telecommunications equipment manufacturers. We believe that the book values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 We use various valuation techniques and assumptions when measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. This guidance established a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of input used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below: 
 Level 1 Inputs Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets.

 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' transaction fees and offering expenses, were approximately million. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of per year, payable in cash on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2022, and mature on June 1, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, converted or repurchased. 
 The 2027 Notes will be convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company s obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted, pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, at an initial conversion rate of 12.9041 shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share). From the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, the holders of the 2027 Notes have the right, but not the obligation, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes. As such, the 2027 Notes are included in " Current portion of long-term debt " in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The 2027 Notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company s current and any future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2027 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company s future secured indebtedness, if any, to the extent of the value of the related collateral, and the 2027 Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of the Company s subsidiaries. 
 On May 24 and May 25, 2022, in connection with the offering of the 2027 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions ("2027 Note Hedge Transactions") that cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately million shares of common stock, in the aggregate, at a strike price that initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes, subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon any conversion of the 2027 Notes. Also, on May 24 and May 25, 2022, we entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions ("2027 Warrant Transactions"), whereby we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately million shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the warrants under the 2027 Warrant Transactions had a weighted average strike price of per share, subject to adjustment, and mature beginning September 2027 through April 2028. 
 2024 Notes, and Related Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions 
 On June 3, 2019, we issued million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Convertible Notes due in 2024 (the "2024 Notes") that bore interest at a rate of per year, payable in cash on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2019, and matured on June 1, 2024. During second quarter 2022, we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering of the 2027 Notes. We repaid the remaining million in aggregate principal at maturity on June 1, 2024.

 million shares of common stock, in the aggregate, at a strike price that corresponded to the conversion price of the 2024 Notes, subject to adjustment, and were exercisable upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes. On May 29 and May 31, 2019, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions (collectively, the "2024 Warrant Transactions" and, together with the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions, the "2024 Call Spread Transactions"), whereby we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately million shares of common stock at an initial strike price of approximately per share, subject to adjustment. 
 At maturity on June 1, 2024, the Company issued million shares to settle the 2024 Notes that had been converted by holders. This issuance was effectively offset by our receipt of million shares from the settlement of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions. The 2024 Warrants settle during the period September 3, 2024 through December 17, 2024 on a net-share basis. million shares have been issued related to the 2024 Warrant Transactions as of September 30, 2024, and warrants to acquire million shares of common stock at an initial strike price of approximately per share, subject to adjustment, remain outstanding.

 Technicolor Patent Acquisition Long-Term Debt 
 On July 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the patent licensing business of Technicolor SA ("Technicolor"), a worldwide technology leader in the media and entertainment sector (the "Technicolor Patent Acquisition"). In conjunction with the Technicolor Patent Acquisition, we assumed Technicolor s rights and obligations under a joint licensing program with Sony relating to digital televisions and standalone computer display monitors, which commenced in 2015 (the "Madison Arrangement"). An affiliate of CPPIB Credit Investments Inc. ("CPPIB Credit"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, is a third-party investor in the Madison Arrangement. CPPIB Credit made certain payments to Technicolor and Sony and agreed to contribute cash to fund certain capital reserve obligations under the arrangement in exchange for a percentage of future revenues, specifically through September 11, 2030 in regard to the Technicolor patents.

 . This rate represents the discount rate that equates the estimated future cash flows with the fair value of the debt as of the acquisition date and is used to compute the amount of interest to be recognized each period based on the estimated life of the future revenue streams. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million and million, respectively, of interest expense related to this debt, compared to million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This was included within Interest Expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Any future payments made to CPPIB Credit, or additional proceeds received from CPPIB Credit, will decrease or increase the long-term debt balance accordingly. We made million in payments to CPPIB Credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and payments were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Technicolor Contingent Consideration 
 As part of the Technicolor Patent Acquisition, we entered into a revenue-sharing arrangement with Technicolor that created a contingent consideration liability. Under the revenue-sharing arrangement, Technicolor receives of future cash receipts from new licensing efforts from the Madison Arrangement only, subject to certain conditions and hurdles. As of September 30, 2024, the contingent consideration liability from the revenue-sharing arrangement was deemed not probable and is therefore not reflected within the consolidated financial statements.

 of the Company s patents relating to 3G and/or 4G/LTE standards. The Company sought, among other relief, injunctive relief to prevent further infringement of the asserted patents or, in the alternative, a determination of the terms of a FRAND license. 
 Between 2021 and 2023, of the Company s European Patents were found by UK courts to be valid, essential and infringed by Lenovo. In March 2023, the UK High Court issued an order staying all deadlines with respect to the fourth and fifth technical trials.

 million for such license through December 31, 2023. On June 27, 2023, the court issued an order awarding the Company an additional million, thus increasing the total award to million, which was paid on July 11, 2023. The court also found that the Company should pay a portion of Lenovo s costs and granted both parties permission to appeal on certain grounds. Both parties appealed certain aspects of the ruling, and in July 2024, the UK Court of Appeal ruled in favor of InterDigital and awarded the Company an additional amount of million to a total of approximately million. It rejected Lenovo s appeal in its entirety and confirmed that Lenovo must pay for all of its past sales starting from 2007 through December 31, 2023. The court also found that Lenovo should pay the Company s costs for the appeal and reduced the costs that Lenovo was awarded from the initial decision. Lenovo sought permission to appeal, and permission to appeal was refused by the UK Court of Appeals. Lenovo filed an application to the UK Supreme Court requesting permission to appeal on August 9, 2024; Lenovo withdrew its application to appeal in October 2024 following entry into the arbitration agreement described above. 
 On September 24, 2023, Lenovo filed a new claim in the UK High Court, which alleged invalidity of of the Company s patents relating to 4G/LTE standards. Lenovo sought, among other relief, a declaration that the patents at issue were invalid, not essential, and not infringed, revocation of the patents at issue, and a declaration that, upon expiration of the current license in 2023, Lenovo is licensed under terms to be determined by the UK High Court through 2028 or, in the alternative, a determination of the terms of a FRAND license. In October 2023, Lenovo filed a request for an order that the Company indicate whether it is prepared to give an unconditional undertaking to enter into a global license on terms set by the UK Court, or failing that, a declaration that the Defendants are unwilling licensors; a hearing was held in December 2023 during which Lenovo agreed to stay its application. The Company filed a jurisdiction challenge in October 2023, and a hearing on such challenge took place in April 2024, following which, the jurisdiction challenge was denied. In November 2023, Lenovo filed an application seeking an expedited FRAND trial and an interim license until a FRAND decision is issued in the UK. A hearing on the interim license was held in February 2024; in March 2024 the UK High Court denied Lenovo s request for the interim license. A FRAND trial was set for June-July 2025. 
 District of Delaware Patent Proceedings 
 In August 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware District Court") against Lenovo alleging that Lenovo infringes of the Company s U.S. patents by making, using, offering for sale, and/or selling Lenovo wireless devices with 3G and/or 4G LTE capabilities. As relief, InterDigital sought: (a) a declaration that the Company is not in breach of its relevant FRAND commitments with respect to Lenovo; (b) to the extent Lenovo does not agree to negotiate a worldwide patent license, does not agree to enter into binding international arbitration to set the terms of a FRAND license, and does not agree to be bound by the terms to be set by the UK High Court in the separately filed UK proceedings described above, an injunction prohibiting Lenovo from continued infringement; (c) damages, including enhanced damages for willful infringement and supplemental damages; and (d) attorneys fees and costs. 
 In June 2023, the parties requested that the entire case be stayed pending resolution of all appeals in the UK proceedings, and this request was granted.

 In April 2020, Lenovo and Motorola Mobility LLC filed a complaint in the Delaware District Court against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the Company defendants violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in connection with, among other things, their licensing of 3G and 4G standards essential patents ("SEPs"). The complaint further alleged that the Company defendants have violated their commitment to the ETSI with respect to the licensing of 3G and 4G SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions. The complaint sought, among other things (i) rulings that the Company defendants have violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and are liable for breach of their ETSI FRAND commitments, (ii) a judgment that the plaintiffs are entitled to a license with respect to the Company s 3G and 4G SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions, and (iii) injunctions against any demand for allegedly excessive royalties or enforcement of the Company defendants 3G and 4G U.S. SEPs against the plaintiffs or their customers via patent infringement proceedings.

 OTHER 
 We are party to certain other disputes and legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations and legal proceedings with licensees regarding the terms of their agreements and the negotiation thereof. We do not currently believe that these matters, even if adversely adjudicated or settled, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. None of the preceding matters have met the requirements for accrual or disclosure of a potential range as of September 30, 2024, except as noted above.

 and , respectively. The change in effective tax rate is due to a decrease in the amount of Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction benefit available to the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to an increase in the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income inclusion derived from the increase in revenue in certain foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the related tax benefit. Excluding this valuation allowance, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been . During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded discrete net benefits of million and million, respectively, primarily related to share-based compensation. 
 The effective tax rate reported in any given year will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including timing differences between the recognition of book and tax revenue, the level of pre-tax income or loss, the foreign vs. domestic classification of the Company s customers, and any discrete items that may occur. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid approximately million and million, respectively, in foreign source creditable withholding tax.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in addition to our 2023 Form 10-K, other reports filed with the SEC and the Statement Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 Throughout the following discussion and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, we refer to recurring revenues and catch-up revenues. For variable and dynamic fixed-fee license agreements, catch-up revenues primarily represents revenue associated with reporting periods prior to the execution of the license agreement, while recurring revenue represents revenue associated with reporting periods beginning with the execution of the license agreement. For static fixed-fee license agreements, we typically classify the associated revenue as catch-up revenues. 
 Subsequent Events 
 In October 2024, we entered into a patent license agreement with Oppo Group. The agreement covers Oppo, realme and OnePlus branded mobile devices worldwide. As part of the agreement, both parties have agreed to dismiss all pending litigations between us. We expect to recognize revenue related to the patent license agreement beginning in fourth quarter 2024. 
 In October 2024, we entered into an arbitration agreement with Lenovo to determine the terms of a new patent license. As part of the agreement to arbitrate, both parties have agreed to dismiss all pending litigations between them. We expect to recognize revenue related to the arbitration agreement, on an estimated basis, beginning in fourth quarter 2024. 
 New Agreements 
 In September 2024, we signed new patent license agreements with TPV, a major manufacturer of a range of digital TVs under various brands. These agreements license TPV to InterDigital s extensive portfolio of HEVC patents as well as DTV patents licensed through InterDigital s joint licensing program with Sony. Additionally, in August 2024, we signed a signed a new license agreement with Panasonic. 
 Notes, Hedge, and Warrant Transactions 
 A portion of the 2024 Warrant Transaction settled during third quarter 2024 resulting in the issuance of 0.1 million shares. As of September 30, 2024, 1.1 million warrants at an initial strike price of approximately 109.43 per share, subject to adjustment, remain outstanding and will settle, on a net-share basis, during the period October 1, 2024 to December 17, 2024. Additionally, 5.9 million warrants remain outstanding related to the 2027 Warrant Transactions at a weighted average strike price of 106.31 per share, subject to adjustment, which mature on a net-share basis beginning September 2027 through April 2028. 
 During third quarter 2024, the 2027 Notes had a dilutive impact of 2.4 million shares, which are offset from an economic standpoint by the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions and would result in no incremental shares being issued upon conversion. However, under GAAP, we are required to exclude the impact of the shares received from the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions counterparties from the calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
 Assuming a share price of 150, we would issue 0.3 million and 1.7 million of common shares related to the 2024 and 2027 Warrant Transactions, respectively. Refer to " Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Convertible Notes " for further information regarding how changes in our stock price would affect the number of shares issuable related to the 2024 Warrant Transactions and the 2027 Warrant Transactions. 
 Return of Capital to Shareholders 
 During the third quarter 2024, we returned 14.5 million to shareholders, including 11.4 million, or 0.45 per share, of cash dividends declared and 3.1 million through the repurchase of shares of common stock. Additionally, we announced an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from 0.40 to 0.45 per share, beginning with the dividend paid in fourth quarter 2024. 
 As of October 31, 2024, there was 229.5 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization, which we plan to utilize to periodically repurchase additional common shares. See Part II, Item II - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Cash Short-term Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 822.9 million of cash, restricted cash, and short-term investments and over 1.1 billion of cash payments due under contracted fixed price agreements, which includes our conservative estimates of the minimum cash receipts that we expect to receive under the wireless patent license agreement with Samsung. 
 88 of our recurring revenue comes from fixed-fee royalties. Such agreements often have prescribed payment schedules that are uneven and sometimes front-loaded, resulting in timing differences between when we collect the cash payments and recognize the related revenue. 
 The following table reconciles the timing differences between cash receipts and recognized revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including the resulting operating cash flow (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Cash vs. Non-cash revenue: 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fixed fee cash receipts (a) 
 160,300 368,608 384,990 404,967 Other cash receipts (b)

 77,631 310,610 79,494 237,318 
 
 (a) Fixed fee cash receipts are comprised of cash receipts from Dynamic Fixed-Fee Agreement royalties, including the associated catch-up royalties 
 (b) Other cash receipts are primarily comprised of cash receipts related to our variable patent royalty revenue and catch-up revenues. 
 (c) The changes in other are primarily driven by customer deposits partially offset by long-term contract assets associated with revenue estimates. 
 When we collect payments on a front-loaded basis, we recognize a deferred revenue liability equal to the cash received and accounts receivable recorded which relate to revenue expected to be recognized in future periods. That liability is then reduced as we recognize revenue over the balance of the agreement. The following table shows the projected amortization of our current and long term deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Deferred Revenue Remainder of 2024 52,406 2025 138,874 2026 139,057 2027 39,596 2028 1,141 Thereafter 2,476 Total Revenue 373,550 
 Revenue 
 Total revenues of 128.7 million, which includes both recurring and catch-up revenues, decreased 8 compared to third quarter 2023 primarily due to catch-up revenues from the Lenovo HEVC agreement recognized in third quarter 2023, partially offset by revenues recognized from new agreements and the resolution of litigation. Third quarter 2024 recurring revenues were 98.6 million, compared to recurring revenues of 104.5 million in third quarter 2023. In third quarter 2024, revenues (in descending order) from Apple, Samsung, TPV, Lenovo, and Xiaomi each comprised 10 or more of our consolidated revenues. Refer to " Results of Operations --Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 " for further discussion of our 2024 revenue.

 Impact of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Factors 
 We have been actively monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic environment in the U.S. and globally characterized by inflation, supply chain issues, high interest rates, labor shortages, and the potential for a recession. These market factors, as well as the impacts of the Ukraine-Russia and Middle East conflicts, have not had a material impact on our business to date. However, if these conditions continue or worsen, they could have an adverse effect on our operating results and our financial condition. 
 Comparability of Financial Results 
 When comparing third quarter 2024 financial results against other periods, the following items should be taken into consideration: 
 Revenue 
 Our third quarter 2024 revenues include 30.0 million of catch-up revenues primarily related to new agreements and the resolution of litigation. 
 Operating Expenses 
 During third quarter 2024, we recorded a 1.2 million one-time contra expense for a net litigation fee reimbursement. See Note 6, Litigation and Legal Proceedings , to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the litigation proceedings. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, " Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Guidance ", in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. A discussion of our critical accounting policies, and the estimates related to them, are included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our existing critical accounting policies from the disclosures included in our 2023 Form 10-K. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation , in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for updates related to new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies. 
 
 FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as cash generated from operations. We believe we have the ability to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity financings. From time to time, we may engage in a variety of transactions to augment our liquidity position as our business dictates and to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions, including the incurrence or issuance of debt and the refinancing or restructuring of existing debt. Based on our past performance and current expectations, we believe our available sources of funds, including cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and cash generated from our operations, will be sufficient to finance our operations, capital requirements, debt obligations, existing stock repurchase program, dividend program, and other contractual obligations discussed below in both the short-term over the next twelve months, and the long-term beyond twelve months. 
 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the following amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase / (Decrease) 
 Cash and cash equivalents 401,090 437,076 (35,986) Restricted cash included within prepaid and other current assets 9,690 5,885 3,805 Short-term investments 412,120 569,280 (157,160) Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments 
 822,900 1,012,241 (189,341) 
 The net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments was attributable to cash used in financing activities of 251.0 million and cash used in investing activities of 33.9 million, excluding sales and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 79.5 million. Refer to the sections below for further discussion of these items.

 Cash flows provided by operating activities 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities in the first nine months 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 
 79,494 237,318 (157,824) 
 Our cash flows provided by operating activities are principally derived from cash receipts from patent license agreements, offset by cash operating expenses and income tax payments. The 157.8 million change in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased cash operating expenses primarily due to increased revenue share costs from new patent license agreements and lower cash receipts primarily due to cash receipts from new agreements signed in both periods and timing of cash receipts from existing patent license agreements. The table below sets forth the significant items comprising our cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Total Cash Receipts 420,736 442,587 (21,851) Cash Outflows: Cash operating expenses a

 79,494 237,318 (157,824) 
 ______________________________ 
 (a) Cash operating expenses include operating expenses less depreciation and disposals of fixed assets, amortization of patents, and non-cash compensation. Amount includes revenue share costs of 78.7 million and 2.4 million in first nine months 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (b) Income taxes paid include foreign withholding taxes. 
 Cash flows from investing and financing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for first nine months 2024 was 139.4 million, a 213.6 million change from 74.3 million of net cash used in investing activities in first nine months 2023. During first nine months 2024, we sold 173.2 million of short-term marketable securities, net of purchases, and capitalized 35.4 million of patent costs and property and equipment purchases. During first nine months 2023, we purchased 43.7 million of short-term marketable securities, net of sales, and capitalized 31.2 million of patent costs and property and equipment purchases. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for first nine months 2024 was 251.0 million, a change of 89.4 million from 340.5 million the first nine months 2023. This change was primarily attributable to a 236.0 million decrease in share repurchases, of which 203.4 million was related to the Company's modified "Dutch auction" tender offer in first quarter 2023. This change was partially offset by 139.1 million of payments on our long-term debt, of which 126.2 million was related to the maturity of the 2024 Notes. 
 Other 
 Our combined short-term and long-term deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 373.6 million, a net decrease of 3.9 million from December 31, 2023. This decrease in deferred revenue was primarily due amortization of deferred revenue recognized in the period, partially offset by cash receipts on new and existing patent license agreements. 
 Based on current license agreements, we expect the amortization of dynamic fixed-fee royalty payments to reduce the September 30, 2024 deferred revenue balance of 373.6 million by 156.9 million over the next twelve months.

 Convertible Notes 
 See Note 5, Obligations to the Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for definitions of capitalized terms below. 
 The 2024 Notes matured on June 1, 2024 resulting in 0.3 million of common shares being issued. This issuance was effectively offset by the settlement of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions resulting in zero net shares being issued on June 1, 2024. 
 A portion of the 2024 Warrant Transactions settled during third quarter 2024 resulting in the issuance of 0.1 million shares related to the 2024 Warrant Transactions. As of September 30, 2024, 1.1 million warrants at an initial strike price of approximately 109.43 per share, subject to adjustment, remain outstanding and will settle during the period October 1, 2024 to December 17, 2024 on a net-share basis. 
 From the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, the holders of the 2027 Notes have the right, but not the obligation, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes. 
 Our 2027 Notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, we must assume that conversion of convertible securities occurs at the beginning of the reporting period. The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount to be converted. Any remaining obligation of the 2027 Notes may be settled in cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof. As the principal amount must be paid in cash and only the conversion spread is settled in shares, we only include the net number of incremental shares that would be issued upon conversion. We must calculate the number of shares of our common stock issuable under the terms of the 2027 Notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period. 
 At the time we issued the 2027 Notes, we entered into the 2027 Call Spread Transactions that together were designed to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued in the event of conversion of the 2027 Notes by, in effect, increasing the conversion price of the 2027 Notes from our economic standpoint. However, under GAAP, since the impact of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions is anti-dilutive, we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement. 
 During periods in which the average market price of our common stock is above the applicable conversion price of the 2027 Notes (initial conversion price of approximately 77.49 per share), or above the strike price of the warrants (weighted average strike price of 106.31 per share), the impact of conversion or exercise, as applicable, would be dilutive and such dilutive effect is reflected in diluted earnings per share. As a result, in periods where the average market price of our common stock is above the conversion price or strike price, as applicable, under the if-converted method, we calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of the 2027 Notes and the 2027 Warrant Transactions based on the average market price of the stock during the period, and include that number in the total diluted shares outstanding for the period.

Table of Contents 

 Under the if-converted method, changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation. As described in Note 5, " Obligations, " the 2027 Notes are convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount to be converted and any remaining obligation may be settled in cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof ("net share settlement"). Assuming net share settlement upon conversion, the following tables illustrate how, based on the 460.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and the approximately 5.9 million warrants related to the 2027 Notes, changes in our stock price would affect (i) the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, (ii) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants subject to the 2027 Warrant Transactions, (iii) the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the 2027 Notes, after applying the if-converted method, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share ("Total If-Converted Method Incremental Shares"), (iv) the number of shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon settlement of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions and (v) the number of shares issuable upon concurrent conversion of the 2027 Notes, exercise of the warrants subject to the 2027 Warrant Transactions, and settlement of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions (in thousands):

 (a) Catch-up revenues are comprised of past patent royalties and revenues from static agreements. 
 Total revenues of 128.7 million, which includes both recurring and catch-up revenues, decreased 8 from third quarter 2023 primarily due to catch-up revenues from the Lenovo HEVC agreement recognized in third quarter 2023, partially offset by revenues recognized from new agreements and the resolution of litigation. 
 Recurring revenues decreased 6 to 98.6 million primarily due to the 2023 expiration of Huawei and other agreements, which were partially offset by increased CE, IoT/Auto revenues. 
 In third quarter 2024 and 2023, 83 and 78 , respectively, of our total revenue was attributable to licensees that individually accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue. In third quarter 2024 and 2023, the following licensees accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue:

 Operating Expenses 
 The following table summarizes the changes in operating expenses between third quarter 2024 and third quarter 2023 by category (in thousands):

 28 

Table of Contents 

 Operating expenses increased to 89.3 million in third quarter 2024 from 86.5 million in third quarter 2023. The 2.9 million increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to changes in the following items (in thousands): 
 Increase/(Decrease) Revenue share 
 6,089 Performance-based compensation 
 (1,376) Net litigation fee reimbursement (1,161) Other (668) Total increase in operating expenses 2,884 
 Operating expenses were relatively flat compared to third quarter 2023. Revenue share costs increased 6.1 million primarily due to the TPV and Samsung TV agreements signed in 2024, which are subject to the Madison revenue share arrangement. This increase was offset by a 1.4 million decrease in performance-based compensation mostly due to one-time performance-based compensation costs recognized in third quarter 2023 and 1.2 million net litigation fee reimbursements due to litigation successes. 
 Research and portfolio development expense: Research and portfolio development decreased 1.9 million primarily due to the above-noted decrease in performance-based compensation, as well as a decrease in patent amortization. 
 Licensing expense: Licensing expense increased 5.9 million primarily driven by the above-noted revenue share costs, partially offset by the one-time net litigation fee reimbursement. 
 General and administrative expense: General and administrative expense decreased by 1.1 million primarily due to the above-noted decreased performance-based compensation costs. 
 
 Non-Operating Income, net 
 The following table compares third quarter 2024 non-operating income, net to third quarter 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Interest expense (10,681) (12,683) 2,002 16 Interest and investment income 9,175 11,763 (2,588) (22) Other income, net 3,379 2,962 417 14 Total non-operating income, net 1,873 2,042 (169) (8) 
 Non-operating income, net was relatively flat with decreased interest expense mostly offsetting the decreased interest and investment income that is based on lower investment balances compared to third quarter 2023. The change in Other income, net was primarily due to a foreign currency translation net gain arising from translation of our foreign subsidiaries of 2.8 million in third quarter 2024, compared to a 2.2 million net loss in third quarter 2023 and due to fair value adjustments of our investments resulting in a 1.1 million net gain in third quarter 2024, compared to a 5.6 million net gain in third quarter 2023. 
 
 Income taxes 
 In third quarter 2024 and 2023, based on the statutory federal tax rate net of discrete federal and state taxes, we had an effective tax rate of 17.0 and 15.3 , respectively. The change in effective tax rate is due to a decrease in the amount of Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction benefit available to the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to an increase in the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income inclusion derived from the increase in revenue in certain foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the related tax benefit. Excluding this valuation allowance, our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 14.4 .

 (a) Catch-up revenues are comprised of past patent royalties and revenues from static agreements. 
 Total revenues of 615.7 million, which includes both recurring and catch-up revenues, increased 39 from the first nine months 2023 primarily due to catch-up revenues recognized from both new agreements and the resolution of litigation, partially offset by catch-up revenues related to the Lenovo UK proceedings and other previously announced agreements recognized in first nine months ended 2023. 
 Recurring revenues decreased 4 to 291.4 million, compared to 305.1 million in first nine months 2023, with increased CE, IoT/Auto revenue mostly offsetting the 2023 expiration of Huawei and other agreements. 
 In first nine months 2024 and 2023, 77 and 79 of our total revenue, respectively, was attributable to companies that individually accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue. In first nine months 2024 and 2023, the following companies accounted for 10 or more of our total revenue:

Table of Contents 

 Operating expenses increased 37 to 338.7 million in first nine months 2024 from 247.8 million in first nine months 2023. The 90.9 million increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to changes in the following items (in thousands): 
 Increase/(Decrease) Revenue share 76,280 Intellectual property enforcement 23,341 Performance-based compensation 6,033 Net litigation fee reimbursement (11,898) Other (2,808) Total increase in operating expenses 90,948 
 The 90.9 million increase in operating expenses was driven by a 76.3 million increase in revenue share costs primarily related to the TPV and Samsung TV agreements and a 6.0 million increase in performance-based compensation due to higher accrual rates driven by licensing successes. Additionally, intellectual property enforcement costs increased 23.3 million due to costs associated with the Lenovo and Oppo proceedings, as well as the Samsung arbitration. These increases were partially offset by a change in the net litigation reimbursement contra expense of 4.4 million recorded in first nine months 2024 compared to 7.5 million of expense recorded in first nine months 2023. 
 Research and portfolio development expense: Research and portfolio development expense was flat compared to first nine months 2023. 
 Licensing expense: Licensing expense increased by 89.7 million primarily driven by the above-noted increased revenue share costs and intellectual property enforcement costs, partially offset by the one-time net litigation fee reimbursement. 
 General and administrative expense: The 3.0 million increase in general and administrative expense primarily resulted from the above-noted increases in performance-based compensation costs. 
 
 Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net 
 The following table compares first nine months 2024 non-operating expense, net to first nine months 2023 non-operating income, net (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease) Interest expense (34,086) (36,911) 2,825 8 Interest and investment income 31,078 33,697 (2,619) (8) Other income, net 
 2,405 8,606 (6,201) (72) Total non-operating (expense) income, net (603) 5,392 (5,995) (111) 
 Interest expense and interest and investment income were relatively flat compared to first nine months 2023, with the decreased interest and investment income mostly offset by the decreased interest expense. Other income, net changed primarily due to fair value adjustments of our investments resulting in a 4.6 million net gain in first nine months 2024, compared to a 10.5 million net gain in first nine months 2023. 
 
 Income taxes 
 In first nine months 2024 and 2023, we had an effective tax rate of 18.4 and 14.7 , respectively. The change in effective tax rate is due to a decrease in the amount of Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction benefit available to the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to an increase in the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income inclusion derived from the increase in revenue in certain foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate in first nine months 2023 was impacted by losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the related tax benefit. Excluding this valuation allowance, our effective tax rate for nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 13.4 . In the nine months ended 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of 4.3 million and 2.9 million, respectively, primarily related to share-based compensation.
