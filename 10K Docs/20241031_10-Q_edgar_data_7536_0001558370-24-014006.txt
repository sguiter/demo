 Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (refer to Note C). The company tests these assets for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist or at least annually if indefinite-lived. Derivative Instruments The company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading. Certain derivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and assessed for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Interest Rate Swaps The company manages the risk of variability in interest rates of future expected debt issuances by entering into various forward-starting interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the shareholders equity section in the company s consolidated balance sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified into income over the life of the anticipated debt issuance or in the period the hedged forecasted cash flows are deemed no longer probable to occur. Reclassified gains and losses are recorded within the line item Interest and other financing expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of interest rate swaps are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative using observable inputs, including interest rate curves and credit spreads. In June 2023, the company terminated its outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps and received a cash payment of million, which was reported in the Cash flows from financing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. In April 2024, the forecasted bond issuance occurred, and the million gain will be amortized to "Interest and other financing expense, net" in the company's consolidated statement of operations over the -year life of the bond. The company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions, designated as fair value hedges, that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. For qualifying interest rate fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in Interest and other financing expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value and is also included in Interest and other financing expense, net . As of December 31, 2023, the company had one outstanding interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge of its notes due in March 2026, the terms of which were as follows: SOFR+ The counterparty to the interest rate swap had the option to cancel the swaps after one year, without penalty. In March 2024, the counterparty cancelled the swap and the company de-designated the fair value hedging relationship. Foreign Exchange Contracts The company s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. The company s exposures to such transactions are denominated primarily in the following currencies: Euro, Indian Rupee, and Israeli New Shekel. The company enters into foreign exchange forward, option, or swap contracts (collectively, the foreign exchange contracts to facilitate the

 billion and billion, respectively. Gains and losses related to non-designated foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in Cost of sales on the company s consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, general, and administrative, and Interest and other financing expense, net based upon the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, on the company s consolidated statements of operations.

The following foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges, hedging a portion of the company s net investments in subsidiaries with Euro-denominated net assets: April 2025 EUR EUR January 2028 EUR EUR Total EUR EUR The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded in CTA within Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the company s consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 10 Shareholders Equity in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Share-Repurchase Program The following table shows the company s share-repurchase program as of September 28, 2024: January 2023 Total The company repurchased million shares and million shares of its common stock for million and million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, under the company s share-repurchase program, excluding excise taxes. During the first nine months of 2024, the company accrued million of excise tax, which is recorded within Treasury stock on the company s consolidated balance sheets and reduces the share-repurchase authorization, as the excise tax is a part of the overall cost of acquiring treasury shares. As of September 28, 2024, approximately million remained available for repurchase under the share-repurchase program. The company s share-repurchase program does not have an expiration date. million for ongoing environmental remediation efforts at sites in Huntsville, Alabama (the Huntsville site and Norco, California (the Norco site at which contaminated soil and groundwater was identified. The contamination related to activities of certain subsidiaries which ended prior to 2000. Remediation efforts began in 2015 and 2003 at the Huntsville site and Norco site, respectively, and are progressing under action plans monitored by local environmental agencies. Costs are recorded for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities are included in Accrued expenses and Other liabilities

 million and million related to environmental costs at the Huntsville site and the Norco site, respectively. The subsequent environmental costs at the Huntsville site are estimated to be between million and million and at the Norco site they are estimated to be between million and million. The company expects the liabilities associated with such ongoing remediation to be resolved over an extended period of time with current estimates extending beyond 2040. The accruals for environmental liabilities are adjusted periodically as facts and circumstances change, assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to various unknown factors such as the timing and extent of remediation, the efficacy and long-term costs of remediation, improvements in remediation technologies, orders by administrative agencies, and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may change in the future. Accordingly, the company cannot presently estimate the ultimate potential costs related to either of the two sites. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the company recorded charges of million and million, respectively, related to increases in the environmental liabilities for the Huntsville and Norco sites. These costs are included in Restructuring, integration, and other on the company s consolidated statements of operations. To date, the company has recovered approximately million from certain insurance carriers relating to environmental clean-up matters at these sites and continues to pursue additional recoveries from one insurer related solely to the Huntsville site. The company has not recorded a receivable for any potential future insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that the company will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other During the third quarter of 2023, the company received million in settlement funds in connection with claims filed against certain manufacturers of aluminum, tantalum, and film capacitors who allegedly colluded to fix the price of capacitors from 2001 through 2014. These amounts were recorded as a reduction to Selling, general, and administrative in the company s consolidated statements of operations. From time to time, in the normal course of business, the company may become liable with respect to other pending and threatened litigation, environmental, regulatory, labor, product, and tax matters. While such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, it is not currently anticipated that any such matters will materially impact the company s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

These trends could continue throughout 2024 and the duration and severity of the current downturn remain uncertain. Within the company s global ECS reportable segment, in certain periods, changes in the mix of sales of IT solutions can impact the proportion of the company s revenue that is recorded on a net basis compared to a gross basis. This is driven by the company s responsibilities in the sale of various IT solutions, which is based on terms and conditions in place with its partners. These changes can increase or decrease sales during a period without a corresponding change in gross profit. Refer to Note 1 Sum mary of Significant Accounting Policies in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On October 31, 2024, the company announced a multi-year restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Refer to Restructuring, Integration, and Other section below.

 The sum of the components for sales by geographic region and consolidated sales may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding. During the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, the global components reportable segment continued to experience a cyclical downturn characterized by elevated customer inventory levels, and a challenging global macroeconomic environment, contributing to lower demand for the company s products. The decrease in sales compared to the year-earlier periods was primarily due to the following impacts: 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 sales declines in the Americas region primarily due to decreased demand for most major verticals, particularly industrial and communications; sales declines in the EMEA region primarily due to decreased demand for industrial and transportation verticals; sales declines in the Asia/Pacific region primarily due to decreased demand for industrial and networking communications verticals. 
 Within the global ECS reportable segment, growth in the EMEA region for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, relative to the year-earlier periods, is primarily due to increased demand for business applications, infrastructure applications, and compute. During the third quarter of 2024, sales in the Americas region were driven by relative strength in the public sector and for cloud-related solutions, largely offset by softness in data storage, cyber security and data intelligence. During the first nine months of 2024, sales in the Americas region decreased primarily due to decreased demand for storage and security. Substantially all of the company s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company s business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months. Gross Profit Following is an analysis of the company s consolidated gross profit: 

Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, (millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gross profit, as reported 785 980 (19.9) 2,489 3,159 (21.2) Impact of wind down to inventory (2) 10 Impact of changes in foreign currencies 4 (3) Non-GAAP gross profit 783 983 (20.4) 2,499 3,157 (20.8) Gross profit as a percentage of sales, as reported 11.5 12.2 (70) bps 12.1 12.5 (40) bps Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of sales 11.5 12.2 (70) bps 12.1 12.5 (40) bps 

 The sum of the components for non-GAAP gross profit may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding. The dec rease in gross profit related primarily to declining demand and gross profit margins for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024. Global components gross profit margins decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-earlier periods, due to product mix shifting toward lower margin products and regional mix shifting more towards the Asia/Pacific region. Global components supply chain services offerings continued to have a positive impact on gross margins. Global ECS gross profit margins decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-earlier periods, due to softer margins in the Americas region as the company works to optimize the customer mix and supplier line card to better serve the mid-market.

 Operating Expenses Following is an analysis of the company s consolidated operating expenses: 

Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, (millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Operating expenses, as reported 610 640 (4.7) 1,916 2,005 (4.5) Identifiable intangible asset amortization (7) (8) (22) (24) Restructuring, integration, and other (34) (31) (122) (44) Impact of changes in foreign currencies 2 (1) Non-GAAP operating expenses 568 602 (5.7) 1,771 1,936 (8.5) Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 8.9 8.0 90 bps 9.3 7.9 140 bps Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales, constant currency 8.3 7.5 80 bps 8.6 7.7 90 bps 

 The sum of the components for non-GAAP operating expenses may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding. Operating expenses decreased by 29.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the year-earlier period primarily due to the following: a decrease of 50.5 million in charges taken for allowance for credit losses; a decrease of 26.4 million in employee related costs, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and lower sales incentives; partially offset by an increase of 62.2 million due to a legal settlement benefit recognized in connection with certain legal matters in 2023 with no similar items recorded in 2024. Operating expenses decreased by 89.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the year-earlier period primarily due to the following: a decrease of 93.0 million in employee related costs, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and lower sales incentives; a decrease of 86.8 million in charges taken for allowance for credit losses; partially offset by an increase of 77.6 million due to higher restructuring, integration and other charges (see discussion below); and an increase of 62.2 million due to a legal settlement benefit recognized in connection with certain legal matters in 2023 with no similar items recorded in 2024. The changes discussed above related to the allowance for credit losses include charges of 21.9 million and 25.4 million recorded during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, related to one customer in the global ECS reportable segment, of which 20.0 million was subsequently reversed upon recovery during the second quarter of 2024.

 The sum of the components for restructuring, integration, and other may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding. On October 31, 2024, in response to evolving business needs and as part of an initiative to optimize operating expenses, the company announced a multi-year restructuring plan (the Operating Expense Efficiency Plan or the Plan ). The Plan is designed to improve operational efficiency through the following measures: (i) reorganizing and consolidating certain areas of the company s operations to centralize functions and streamline resources, with a focus on more cost-efficient regions; (ii) enhancing warehouse and logistics operations; (iii) investing in information technology to support automation and process improvements; (iv) consolidating the company s global real estate footprint; (v) reducing third-party spending; and (vi) winding down certain non-core businesses that are not aligned with the company s strategic objectives. Under the Plan, the company expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately 185.0 million, consisting of approximately 110.0 million of employee severance and other personnel cash expenditures; approximately 50.0 million of non-cash asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and inventory write-downs related to the wind-down of certain business operations; and approximately 25.0 million of other related cash expenditures. The company expects to substantially complete the Plan by the end of fiscal year 2026, subject to, among other things, local legal and consultation requirements. As a result of the Plan, the company expects to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately 90.0 million to 100.0 million by the end of fiscal year 2026. The estimate of the charges that the company expects to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local legal requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, the company may incur other charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the Plan. Other Charges For the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, other charges included the following: charges of 20.3 mil lion and 80.8 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively, related to the termination of personnel as a part of operating expense reduction initiatives not related to exit or disposal activities; consulting costs of 11.2 million and 25.3 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively, related to ongoing cost reduction initiatives; and charges of 0.3 million and 6.8 million related to early lease terminations and related asset impairments. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, other charges include 20.9 million and 23.3 million, respectively, related to an increase in environmental liabilities (refer to the heading Environmental Matters in Note L Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

 The decrease in consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 relates primarily to the changes in sales, gross profit margins and operating expenses discussed above. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales in the global components reportable segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relates primarily to lower sales, lower gross margins, and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales, when compared to the year earlier period, were partially due to 62.2 million in legal settlements recorded as a decrease to operating expense in third quarter of 2023 with no similar items recorded in 2024. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales in the global ECS reportable segment related primarily to a decrease in charges taken for the allowance for credit losses of 20.4 million and 48.1 million, respectively, primarily related to charges of 21.9 million and 25.4 million, recorded during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, related to one customer, of which 20.0 million was subsequently reversed upon recovery for aged receivables that were collected during the second quarter of 2024.

Interest and Other Financing Expense, Net The company recorded net interest and other financing expense as follows: 

Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, (millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest and other financing expense, net (63) (82) (209) (247) The decreases in interest and other financing expenses, net for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the year-earlier periods were primarily related to lower average daily borrowings on floating rate credit facilities. Refer to the section below titled Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on changes in borrowings. Income Tax Income taxes for the interim periods presented have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on the basis of an estimated annual effective tax rate. The determination of the consolidated provision for income taxes requires management to make certain judgments and estimates. Changes in the estimated level of annual pre-tax earnings, tax laws, and changes resulting from tax audits can affect the overall effective income tax rate, which impacts the level of income tax expense and net income. Judgments and estimates related to the company s projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain, therefore, actual results could differ from projections.

 Following is an analysis of the company s consolidated effective income tax rate: 

Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Effective income tax rate 13.1 20.7 18.6 22.0 Identifiable intangible asset amortization 0.6 0.1 0.3 0.1 Restructuring, integration, and other 2.7 0.3 1.6 0.1 (Gain) loss on investments, net (0.3) 0.1 Impact of wind down to inventory (0.1) 0.1 Impact of tax legislation changes (0.1) Non-GAAP effective income tax rate 15.9 21.2 20.6 22.1 

 The sum of the components for non-GAAP effective income tax rate may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding. The company s effective tax rate deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate mainly due to the mix of foreign taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates and where its foreign subsidiaries generate taxable income, among other things. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, compared to the year-earlier periods, is primarily driven by the level of taxable income and mix of tax jurisdictions where earnings are generated, decreases to uncertain tax positions, including a favorable tax audit settlement, taxation of stock-based compensation, and tax law changes. Net Income Attributable to Shareholders Following is an analysis of the company s consolidated net income attributable to shareholders: 

Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, September 30, September 28, September 30, (millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to shareholders, as reported 101 199 293 709 Identifiable intangible asset amortization 7 8 22 23 Restructuring, integration, and other 34 31 122 44 (Gain) loss on investments, net (4) 6 1 (5) Impact of wind down to inventory (2) 10 Loss on extinguishment of debt 2 Tax effect of adjustments above (9) (11) (39) (15) Impact of tax legislation changes 1 Non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders 128 233 410 757 

 The sum of the components for non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding. Identifiable intangible asset amortization excludes amortization attributable to the noncontrolling interest. The decrease in net income attributable to shareholders in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 compared to the year-earlier periods, relates primarily to changes in sales, gross margins, interest and other financing expenses, net and income tax as discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management believes that the company s current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and asset securitization programs, and its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its projected cash flow needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. The company s current committed and undrawn liquidity stands at over 2.7 billion in addition to 248.0 million of cash on hand at September 28, 2024. The company also may issue debt or equity securities in the future and management believes the company will have adequate access to the capital markets, if needed. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.

 The company s principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and cash provided by its revolving credit facilities and debt. The company s principal uses of liquidity include cash used in operations, investments to grow working capital, scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings, and the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. The following table presents selected financial information related to liquidity: 

September 28, December 31, (millions) 2024 2023 Change Working capital 6,864 7,355 (491) Cash and cash equivalents 248 218 30 Short-term debt 910 1,654 744 Long-term debt 2,363 2,154 (209) Working Capital The company maintains a significant investment in working capital which the company defines as accounts receivable, net, plus inventories less accounts payable. The change in working capital during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily attributable to decreases in inventory. Working capital as a percentage of sales, which is defined as working capital divided by annualized quarterly sales, increased to 25.1 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.0 in the year-earlier period. The increase was primarily due to lower sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash, with original maturities of three months or less. At September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 248.0 million and 218.1 million, respectively, of which 200.1 million and 160.0 million, respectively, were held outside the United States. The company has 5.3 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which it deems indefinitely reinvested, and recognizes that it may be subject to additional foreign taxes and U.S. state income taxes, if it reverses its indefinite reinvestment assertion on these foreign earnings. The company also has 2.2 billion of foreign earnings that are not deemed permanently reinvested and are available for distribution in future periods as of September 28, 2024. Revolving Credit Facilities and Debt The following tables summarize the company s credit facilities: 

Outstanding Borrowings Borrowing September 28, December 31, (millions) Capacity 2024 2023 North American asset securitization program 1,500 251 198 Revolving credit facility 2,000 Commercial paper program (a) 1,200 539 1,122 Uncommitted lines of credit 500 

 (a) Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are backstopped by available commitments under the company s revolving credit facility.

Receivables sold under the program are excluded from Accounts receivable, net and no corresponding liability is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the average daily balance outstanding under the EMEA asset securitization program was 408.9 million and 644.6 million, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, and the date of issuance of the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the company was out of compliance with certain operational covenants in its EMEA asset securitization program due to an administrative error. As a result, the participating banks have the right to declare the occurrence of an early amortization event, which would result in the cessation of further amounts being sold under the program. All participating banks have agreed to waivers and the parties are in the process of formalizing an amendment to the program which would return the company to compliance. Refer to Note E Accounts Receivable of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The change in cash provided by operating activities during 2024, compared to the year-earlier period, relates primarily to the company s historical counter-cyclical cash flow as the company generates cash flow in periods of lower demand due to reduced investments in working capital.

Table of Contents 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities The net amount of cash used for investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 53.0 million and 46.8 million, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities The net amount of cash used for financing activities was 755.4 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 214.7 million used for financing activities in the year-earlier period. The change in cash used for financing activities relates primarily to the repayment of debt and lower share repurchases during 2024. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 70.2 million and 57.8 million, respectively. The company expects capital expenditures to be approximately 100.0 million for the fiscal year 2024. Share-Repurchase Program The company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock for 200.0 million and 5.7 million shares of its common stock for 700.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, under its share-repurchase program, excluding excise taxes. As of September 28, 2024, approximately 374.6 million remained available for repurchase under the share-repurchase program. The share-repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of the repurchase activity will depend on factors such as the company s working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions, debt repayment obligations or repurchases of debt, share price, and economic and market conditions. The share-repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed, or discontinued at any time subject to the approval of the company s Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations The company has contractual obligations for short-term and long-term debt, interest on short-term and long-term debt, purchase obligations, operating leases, and other sources and uses of capital that are summarized in the sections titled Contractual Obligations and Additional Capital Requirements and Sources in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Refer to Note H Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on hedging activities. As of September 28, 2024, there were no other material changes to the contractual obligations of the company. Critical Accounting Estimates The company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant changes to the company s critical accounting estimates for the first nine months of 2024.
