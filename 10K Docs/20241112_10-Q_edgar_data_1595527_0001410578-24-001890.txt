 properties consisting of million rentable square feet. On December 30, 2022, the Company announced that it was changing its business strategy by expanding the scope of the assets and businesses it may own and operate. The Company may now seek to acquire assets such as hotels, expand its co-working office space business and seek to invest in and operate businesses such as hotel or parking lot management companies. By investing in other asset types, the Company may generate income that does not otherwise constitute income that qualifies for purposes of qualifying as a real estate investment trust for United States U.S. federal income tax purposes REIT ). Excluding hotels, these additional assets do not generate REIT-qualifying income and are operating businesses. As a result, on January 9, 2023, the Company s board of directors authorized the termination of the Company s REIT election which became effective on January 1, 2023. Historically, the Company filed an election to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014, which remained in effect with respect to each taxable year ending on or before December 31, 2022. As a consequence of the Company s decision to terminate its election to be taxed as a REIT, the ownership limitations set forth in Section 5.7 of its charter, including, without limitation, the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit, as defined therein, no longer apply. The Company filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland a Certificate of Notice reflecting the board s determination that it is no longer in its best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT and that therefore the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit will no longer be in effect. On January 11, 2023 the Company effected a 1-for-8 reverse stock split that was previously approved by the Company s board of directors, resulting in each outstanding share of Class A common stock. par value per share (the Class A common stock being converted into shares of common stock, with no fractional shares being issued (the Reverse Stock Split ). All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. Additionally, effective January 19, 2023, the Company amended its charter to change its name to American Strategic Investment Co. from New York City REIT, Inc. Trading of the Company s Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the new name began on January 20, 2023 under the existing trading symbol NYC. Shares of the Company s Class A common stock were first listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE on August 18, 2020. Also, on February 22, 2023, the Company completed a non-transferable rights offering raising gross proceeds of million (the Rights Offering ). As a result, the Company issued shares of its Class A common stock subscribed for in the Rights Offering on February 27, 2023. Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through the OP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company s advisor, New York City Advisors, LLC (the Advisor ), manages the Company s day-to-day business with the assistance of the Company s property manager, New York City Properties, LLC (the Property Manager ). The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC AR Global and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to the Company. The Company also reimburses these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services.

 years. Because many of the Company s leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires that the Company record a receivable for, and include in revenue from tenants, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. When the Company acquires a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease modification is executed. The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. Pursuant to certain of the Company s lease agreements, tenants are required to reimburse the Company for certain property operating expenses (recorded in total revenue from tenants), in addition to paying base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties. To the extent such costs exceed the applicable tenant s base year, many but not all of the Company s leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of increases in operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. Under ASC 842, the Company has elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line Revenue from tenants. For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under both ASC 842 and 840, the Company has reflected them on a net basis.

Also, there were dispositions of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had asset that has been moved to held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet, and thus no further depreciation or amortization through the date of sale is expected. The Company expects the sale to be consummated no later than January 2025.

Assets Held for Sale During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell its 9 Times Square property for a contract sales price of million. The sale is expected to be consummated no later than January 2025. As of September 30, 2024, this asset is classified as held for sale on the Company s balance sheet. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell its 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property for million. On October 12, 2023 the Company sold the property for million and realized net proceeds of million. When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company stops recognizing depreciation and amortization expense on the identified assets and estimates the sales price, net of costs to sell, of those assets. If the carrying amount of the assets classified as held for sale exceeds the estimated net sales price, the Company records an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the Company s estimate of the net sales price of the assets.

 million and million for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for its 9 Times Square property as it was determined that the carrying value exceeded the Company s expected sales price of the asset, less the costs to sell the property as of September 30, 2024. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of million and million for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for its 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property as it was determined that the carrying value exceeded the Company s sales price of the asset, less the costs to sell the property as of September 30, 2023. The following table details the major classes of the assets associated with the property that the Company determined to be classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and 2023: Buildings, fixtures and improvements Acquired Intangible Total real estate investments held for sale, at cost Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ) ) Total real estate investments held for sale, net Impairment charges related to properties reclassified as held for sale ) Assets held for sale Assets Held for Use When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property classified as held for use may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the property for impairment. For the Company, the most common triggering events are (i) concerns regarding the tenant (i.e., credit or expirations) in the Company s single-tenant properties or significant vacancy in the Company s multi-tenant properties and (ii) changes to the Company s expected holding period as a result of business decisions or non-recourse debt maturities. If a triggering event is identified, the Company considers the projected cash flows due to various performance indicators, and where appropriate, the Company evaluates the impact on its ability to recover the carrying value of the properties based on the expected cash flows on an undiscounted basis over its intended holding period. The Company makes certain assumptions in this approach including, among others, the market and economic conditions, expected cash flow projections, intended holding periods and assessments of terminal values. Where more than one possible scenario exists, the Company uses a probability weighted approach in estimating cash flows. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analysis may not be achieved, and actual losses for impairment may be realized in the future. If the undiscounted cash flows over the expected hold period are less than the carrying value, the Company reflects an impairment charge to write the asset down to its fair value. Impairment Charges The Company recorded million and million of impairment charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, on its 9 Times Square property. The impairment charge that was recorded through June 30, 2024 was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value as determined by the letter of intent signed in June of 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company classified the property as held for sale and an additional impairment charge

 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 on its 400 E. 67th Street property. The impairment was triggered as a result of leasing activity at the property. One major tenant s lease expired and they signed a month to month lease with us, which is set to expire in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company had an additional tenant vacate its current space in this property. Per their agreement with the Company, the tenant is required to pay rent for the remainder of term of their existing lease which is set to expire in the third quarter of 2025 but the tenant has continued to pay monthly rent. The Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset as of September 30, 2024 based on the Company s discounted cash flow model for the property. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of million and million, respectively, related to our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property. We recorded impairment charges for this property because we determined that the carrying value exceeded our estimate of the net sale price of the property as of September 30, 2023.

 (1) On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the loan agreement that extended the maturity of the loan to October 31, 2024, which the Company further extended to January 31, 2025, pursuant to an option contained in such agreement, at an effective variable interest rate of one-month SOFR plus a spread of per annum. Debt Covenant Non-Compliance and Cash Sweep Events Debt Covenant Non-Compliance 1140 Avenue of the Americas The Company has breached both a debt service coverage provision and a reserve fund provision under its non-recourse mortgage secured by the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property in each of the last 17 quarters ended September 30, 2024. The principal amount of the loan was million as of September 30, 2024. These breaches are not events of default, rather they require excess cash, if any, generated at the property (after paying operating costs, debt service and capital/tenant replacement reserves) to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants for this loan may be cured if the Company satisfies the required debt service coverage ratio for consecutive quarters, whereupon the additional collateral will be released. The Company can remain subject to this reserve requirement through maturity of the loan without further penalty or ramifications.

 consecutive calendar quarters and the lender reasonably determines that such breach is due to the property being imprudently managed by the current manager, the lender has the right, but not the obligation, to require that the Company replace the current manager with a third party manager chosen by the Company. Cash Sweep Events 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. The Company entered a lease sweep period under the non-recourse mortgage secured by 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from a near-maturity lease with a major tenant at the property set to expire in the third quarter of 2024. The principal amount for the loan was million as of September 30, 2024. Under the loan agreement, a lease sweep period is triggered, when (i) the date that is prior to the end of the term of the major lease, (ii) the date required by the major tenant to give notice of its exercise of a renewal option, (iii) any major tenant lease is surrendered or terminated prior to the expiration date, (iv) if the major tenant discontinues its operations and the major tenants long term debt is not rated lower than investment grade, (v) any material default under the major tenant s lease, (vi) any major tenant insolvency proceeding.

 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the floor strike rate on the contract. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt. In connection with the modification and partial pay down of the Company s mortgage loan on its 9 Times Square property in March 2022, the Company terminated a million notional, LIBOR based pay-fixed interest rate swap and replaced it with a million notional, SOFR based pay-fixed interest rate swap. At the time of the modification a net carrying amount reflecting the amount paid and the off market value rolled into the new swap and remained in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amount was amortized into interest expense over the term of the hedged item. This interest rate swap expired in April 2024 and as a result, there was unamortized balance remaining as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not have any derivatives as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had the following derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.

 restricted shares as part of the annual award by the Company to the Company s board of directors. These restricted shares issued to the board of directors will vest in increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the respective grant dates. The following table displays restricted share award activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: Granted Vested ) Forfeitures ) Unvested, September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted share awards granted and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. Restricted share awards are expensed in accordance with the service period required. Compensation expense related to restricted share awards was approximately million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted share awards is recorded as equity-based compensation in the accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Multi-Year Outperformance Award 2020 OPP On the Listing Date, the Company, the OP and the Advisor entered into the 2020 OPP pursuant to which a performance-based equity award was granted to the Advisor. The award was based on the recommendation of the Company s compensation consultant, and approved by the Company s independent directors, acting as a group. Initially, the award under the 2020 OPP was in the form of a single LTIP Unit. On September 30, 2020, the th trading day following the Listing Date, in accordance with its terms, the single LTIP Unit automatically converted into LTIP Units (adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split), the quotient of million divided by (adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split), representing the average closing price of one share of Class A common stock over the consecutive trading days immediately prior to September 30, 2020. This number of LTIP Units represented the maximum number of LTIP Units that could have been earned by the Advisor during a performance period which ended on August 18, 2023. The compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company determined that none of the of the LTIP Units subject to the 2020 OPP had been earned under the performance measures. For accounting purposes, July 19, 2020 was treated as the grant date (the Grant Date ), because the Company s independent directors approved the 2020 OPP and the award made thereunder on that date. The Company engaged third party specialists, who used a Monte Carlo simulation, to calculate the fair value as of the date the single LTIP Unit converted (September 30, 2020), on which date the fair value was also fixed. The total fair value of the LTIP Units of million was recorded over the requisite service period of years beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Listing Date (August 18, 2023). As a result, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t record any equity-based compensation expense related to the LTIP Units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company recorded equity-based compensation expense related to the LTIP Units of million. As of August 18, 2023, the total fair value of the LTIP Units has been amortized to expense and no future expense remains. Equity-based compensation expense related to the LTIP Units was recorded in equity-based compensation in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The LTIP Units issued pursuant to the 2020 OPP could potentially have been earned by the Advisor during a performance period which ended on August 18, 2023. The compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company determined that none of 

 31 

Table of Contents AMERICAN STRATEGIC INVESTMENT CO. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) 
 of the LTIP Units subject to the 2020 OPP had been earned under the performance measures. These LTIP Units were thus automatically forfeited effective as of August 18, 2023, without the payment of any consideration by the Company or the OP. On that date, the Company reclassified amounts reflected in non-controlling interest for these LTIP Units to additional paid in capital on its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of equity. LTIP Units/Distributions/Redemption The rights of the Advisor as the holder of the LTIP Units were governed by the terms of the LTIP Units set forth in the agreement of limited partnership of the OP. Holders of LTIP Units were entitled to distributions on the LTIP Units equal to of the distributions made per Class A Unit (other than distributions of sale proceeds) until if, and when, the LTIP Units were earned. Distributions paid on a Class A Unit were equal to dividends paid on a share of Class A common stock and were not subject to forfeiture, even though the LTIP Units were not earned and have been forfeited. If the LTIP Units had been earned, the Advisor would have been entitled to a priority catch-up distribution on each earned LTIP Unit equal to of the aggregate distributions paid on Class A Units during the applicable performance period. Any LTIP Units that were earned would have become entitled to receive the same distributions paid on the Class A Units. If the Advisor s capital account with respect to an earned LTIP Unit had been equal to the capital account balance of a Class A Unit, the Advisor, as the holder of the earned LTIP Unit, in its sole discretion, would have been entitled to convert the LTIP Unit into a Class A Unit, which would have in turn been redeemed on a -for-one basis for, at the Company s election, a share of Class A common stock or the cash equivalent thereof. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company has not paid any dividends to their common stockholders. Subsequently, the board decided not to declare any further dividends. There is no assurance as to when or if the board will declare future dividends or the amount of any future dividends that may be declared. Because the LTIP Units only receive distributions when the Class A common stock receives dividends, distributions have been paid since the quarter ended March 31, 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did t pay distributions on the LTIP Units. As discussed above, the LTIP Units were automatically forfeited effective as of August 18, 2023, without the payment of any consideration by the Company or the OP. valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. If and when the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will recover its deferred tax assets, the Company will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The effective tax rate was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company expects to have a taxable loss for federal, state and local income taxes for the year ending December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has recorded income tax expense or benefit (after considering changes in the valuation allowance) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company remains in a net deferred tax asset position with a full valuation allowance as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no material uncertain tax positions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited)) ) ) ) Adjustments to net loss attributable to common stockholders Adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders ) ) ) ) Weighted average shares outstanding Basic and Diluted Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders Basic and Diluted Under current authoritative guidance for determining earnings per share, all unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions are considered to be participating securities and therefore are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common shares and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company s unvested restricted shares, Class A Units and unearned LTIP Units contain rights to receive distributions considered to be non-forfeitable, except in certain limited circumstances, and therefore the Company applies the two-class method of computing earnings per share. The calculation of earnings per share above adjusts net loss to exclude the distributions to the unvested restricted shares, Class A Units and the unearned LTIP Units that were issued under the 2020 OPP from the numerator. On July 1, 2022, the Company announced that it suspended its policy regarding dividends paid on its Class A common stock, beginning with the dividend that would have been payable for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Accordingly, there is no adjustment for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 relating to distributions to LTIP Units which are paid in arrears. Accordingly, since the LTIP Units only receive distributions when the Class A common stock receives dividends there were no distributions to the LTIP Units beginning with the distribution that would have been payable for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and quarterly periods thereafter. Diluted net loss per share assumes the conversion of all Class A common stock share equivalents into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock, unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The Company considers unvested restricted shares, Class A Units and unvested LTIP Units to be common share equivalents. The following table shows common share equivalents on a weighted average basis that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been antidilutive for the periods presented.

Overview We are an externally managed company that owns a portfolio of commercial real estate located within the five boroughs of New York City, primarily Manhattan. Our real estate assets consist of office properties and certain real estate assets that accompany office properties, including retail spaces and amenities and parking garages that do not accompany office spaces. As of September 30, 2024, we owned seven properties consisting of 1.2 million rentable square feet, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of 783.5 million with an overall occupancy of 85.8 . On December 30, 2022, we announced that we were changing our business strategy by expanding the scope of the assets and businesses we may own and operate. By investing in other asset types, we may generate income that does not otherwise constitute income that qualifies for purposes of qualifying as a REIT. As a result, on January 9, 2023, our board of directors authorized termination of our REIT election which became effective as of January 1, 2023. Historically, we had filed an election to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014, which remained in effect with respect to each subsequent taxable year ending on or before the year ended December 31, 2022. On January 11, 2023 we effected a 1-for-8 reverse stock split that was previously approved by our board, resulting in each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value 0.01 per share, (the Class A common stock being converted into 0.125 shares of common stock, with no fractional shares being issued (the Reverse Stock Split ). For additional information, see Note 7 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Also, effective January 19, 2023, we amended our charter to change our name to American Strategic Investment Co. from New York City REIT, Inc. Trading of our Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the new name began on January 20, 2023

 under the existing trading symbol NYC. Shares of our Class A common stock were first listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE on August 18, 2020. Also, on February 22, 2023, we completed a non-transferable rights offering raising gross proceeds of 5.0 million (the Rights Offering ). As a result, we issued 386,100 shares of our Class A common stock subscribed for in the Rights Offering on February 27, 2023. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP and its wholly owned subsidiaries. New York City Advisors, LLC (our Advisor manages our day-to-day business with the assistance of New York City Properties, LLC (our Property Manager ). Our Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC AR Global and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to us. We also reimburse these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to us. Management Update on the Continuing Adverse Economic Impacts Since the COVID-19 Pandemic New York City, where all of our properties are located, was among the hardest hit locations in the country and fully reopened from relevant restrictions and lockdowns on March 7, 2022. The pace of recovery in the New York City office market from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be challenged as leasing and occupancy trends for the broader market have slowed, leading political, community, and business leaders to propose repositioning plans for many New York City office assets that are experiencing high vacancy rates. The adverse economic impacts since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to experience challenges in leasing up available space and maintaining occupancy in our properties. These challenges with leasing activity have negatively impacted, and continue to impact, our results of operations, cash flows, and ability to comply with certain mortgage debt covenants. For additional information on our leasing activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, please see Results of Operations Leasing Activity below. In addition, beginning in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the operating results at (i) 1140 Avenue of the Americas, (ii) 9 Times Square, (iii) 400 E. 67th Street - Laurel Condominium/200 Riverside Boulevard Garage and (iv) 8713 Fifth Avenue properties were negatively impacted, causing covenant non-compliance or cash trap events under the respective non-recourse mortgages for those properties to be triggered. Thus, we have not been able to use excess cash flows, if any, from these properties while the cash trap events are active to fund operating expenses at our other properties and other capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024 two of our mortgages aggregating 109.0 million in principal amount remained in a cash trap events, as described in detail further below in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

Our total overall portfolio occupancy improved as of September 30, 2024 to 85.8 from a total portfolio occupancy of 85.1 as of September 30, 2023 from the following: Occupancy at 9 Times Square improved to 70.6 for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 68.0 for period ended September 30, 2023. This improvement can be attributed to new leases signed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Occupancy at 1140 Avenue of the Americas increased to 79.3 for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 74.6 for period ended September 30, 2023. This improvement can be attributed to new leases signed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.. Occupancy at 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd was at 94.2 for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 100 for the period ended September 30, 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a tenant located at our 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd vacated its current space, however, per their agreement with us, the tenant is required to pay rent for the remainder of term of their existing lease which is set to expire in the third quarter of 2025.

Occupancy at 123 William Street decreased to 89.3 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 92.0 as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in occupancy was due to a lease amendment and a tenant occupying less space and an early termination with a tenant during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 As of September 30, 2024, we owned seven properties, all of which were acquired prior to January 1, 2023. Our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflect changes due to leasing activity and occupancy.

Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses decreased to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expenses is primarily related to a decrease in maintenance expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024. I mpairments of Real Estate Investments During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment charges of 1.9 million related to our 9 Times Square property.

 October 2024 but has been extended to January 2025. The 1.9 million impairment, which represents the reduction of the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value as determined by a purchase and sale agreement less selling costs, executed in August 2024, to sell the property pursuant to the terms of the amended mortgage agreement which encumbers the property (as further discussed in Note 3 Real Estate Investments . We estimate the sale to be consummated no later than January 2025, although there can be no assurance that the sale of this property will occur on its contemplated terms, or at all. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of 25.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on its 400 E. 67th Street property. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset as of September 30, 2024 as a result of a near-maturity lease with a major tenant at the property set to expire in the third quarter of 2024. For more information please see Note 4 Mortgage Notes Payable, Net. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 0.4 million related to our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property. We recorded impairment charges for this property because we determined that the carrying value exceeded our estimate of the net sale price of the property as of September 30, 2023. This property was sold in October 2023. We are currently actively marketing certain properties for sale, and as a part of that process, we continue to monitor the properties for potential impairment. Equity-Based Compensation Equity-based compensation decreased to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts are comprised of restricted share amortization expense and the amortization of our multi-year outperformance award granted to the Advisor in August 2020 (the 2020 OPP ). The 2020 OPP expired on August 18, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2023 contained 1.1 million of equity-based compensation expenses related to the 2020 OPP, whereas the three months ended September 30, 2024 did not contain any amortization related to the 2020 OPP. See Note 11 Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on the 2020 OPP and restricted shares of common stock. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.9 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to lower legal fees of approximately 0.1 million.

Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a lower depreciable asset base between periods primarily relating to an impairment charge in the second quarter 2024 related to our 9 Times Square property. For more information please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

 Interest Expense Interest expense increased to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense can partially be attributed to the maturity of our 49.5 million notional, SOFR based pay-fixed interest rate swap in April 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our weighted-average outstanding debt balance was 399.5 million, and had a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.90 in each period. All of our mortgage debt was either fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate until the maturity of our interest rate swap secured by our 9 Times Square mortgage loan in April 2024. Upon maturity of the interest rate swap in April 2024, the interest rate on the loan secured by that property reverted to a floating variable interest rate. Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 As of September 30, 2024, we owned seven properties, all of which were acquired prior to January 1, 2021. Changes in our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in occupancy which increased rental revenue for previously vacant spaces. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell our 9 Times Square property for a contract sales price of 63.5 million. The sale is expected to be consummated no later than January 2025, and the property is classified as held-for-sale on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. On October 12, 2023 we sold the Hit Factory for a contract sales price of 4.5 million. This property was classified as held-for-sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The sole tenant terminated its lease early and vacated the space during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. The sale of this vacant property eliminated annual carrying costs of approximately 0.3 million associated with owning the property. Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders Net loss attributable to common stockholders was 133.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 32.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net loss income attributable to common stockholders is discussed in detail for each line item of the consolidated statements of operations in the sections that follow.

 Revenue from Tenants Revenue from tenants decreased to 46.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 47.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of lower reimbursable operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Asset and Property Management Fees to Related Parties Fees for asset and property management services paid to our Advisor and Property Manager were 5.8 million and 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on fees incurred from our Advisor and Property Manager. The Advisor was paid in cash for the January, February, June, July, August and September 2024 base management fee, however, the Advisor elected to receive shares in lieu of cash for the March and May 2024 base management fee. Additionally, the Advisor elected to receive shares in lieu of cash for the April property management fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Advisor elected to receive shares in lieu of cash for the January 2023 base management fee, however the remainder of the management fees in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were paid in cash. For accounting purposes these shares are issued using the closing price on date of issuance and the related expense was 1.6 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses decreased 0.2 million to 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease can be attributed to lower repairs and maintenance and utility expenses for the nine months September 30, 2024. Impairments of Real Estate Investments During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of 86.6 million related to our 9 Times Square property. This property is encumbered by a mortgage with a principal balance of 49.5 million that was set to expire in April 2024 but has been extended to January 2025. The 86.6 million impairment, which represents the reduction of the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value as determined by a purchase and sale agreement less selling costs, executed in August 2024, to sell the property, pursuant to the terms of the amended mortgage agreement which encumbers the property (as further discussed in Note 4 Mortgage Notes Payable, Net ). We estimate the sale to be consummated no later than January 2025, although there can be no assurance that the sale of this property will occur on its contemplated terms, or at all. In addition, we recorded impairment charges of 25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on its 400 E. 67th Street property. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset as of September 30, 2024 as a result of a near-maturity lease with a major tenant at the property set to expire in the third quarter of 2024. For more information please see Note 4 Mortgage Notes Payable, Net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 0.4 million related to our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property. We recorded impairment charges for this property because we determined that the carrying value exceeded our estimate of the net sale price of the property as of September 30, 2023. This property was sold in October of 2023. We are currently actively marketing certain properties for sale, and as a part of that process, we continue to monitor the properties for potential impairment.

 Equity-Based Compensation Equity-based compensation decreased to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts are comprised of restricted share amortization expense and the amortization of our multi-year outperformance award granted under the 2020 OPP. The 2020 OPP expired on August 18, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 contained 5.3 million of equity-based compensation expenses related to the 2020 OPP, whereas the nine months ended September 30, 2023 did not contain any amortization related to the 2020 OPP. See Note 11 Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on the 2020 OPP and restricted shares of common stock. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased 1.0 million to 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to (i) lower legal fees of approximately 0.7 million, (ii) a decrease of 0.3 million in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total reimbursement expenses for administrative and personnel services provided by the Advisor were 2.9 million 2.5 million were for salaries, wages, and benefits and 0.4 million related to administrative and overhead expenses) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were 2.7 million 2.3 million were for salaries, wages, and benefits and 0.4 million related to administrative and overhead expenses) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Pursuant to our Advisory Agreement, reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses and reimbursements for salaries, wages, and benefits are subject to annual limits of 3.0 million 2.6 million before the three months ended March 31, 2024) related to salaries, wages, and benefits and 0.4 million related to administrative and overhead expenses. See Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a lower depreciable asset base between periods primarily relating to impairment charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to our 9 Times Square property. For more information please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense can partially be attributed to the maturity of our 49.5 million notional, SOFR based pay-fixed interest rate swap in April 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our weighted average outstanding debt balance was 399.5 million, respectively, and had a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.90 in each period. All of our mortgage debt was either fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate until the maturity of our interest rate swap secured by our 9 Times Square mortgage loan in April 2024. Upon maturity of the interest rate swap in April 2024, the interest rate on the loan secured by that property reverted to a floating variable interest rate.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities The following table represents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from notes payable to related parties 725 725 Repayments of notes payable to related parties (150) (150) Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net Proceeds from Rights Offering, net (see Note 7) 4,059 (4,059) Redemption of fractional shares of common stock and restricted shares (24) 24 Common stock shares withheld upon vesting of restricted shares (10) 10 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 575 4,025 (3,450) Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal demands for cash are to fund operating and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs related to our properties, our debt service obligations and, subject to capital availability, acquisitions. We did not make any new acquisitions or investments in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash As of September 30, 2024 we had cash and cash equivalents of 5.2 million as compared to 5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Under the guarantee of certain enumerated recourse liabilities of the borrower under one of our mortgage loans, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth in excess of 175.0 million and minimum liquid assets (i.e. cash and cash equivalents) of 10.0 million, which includes cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which totaled 15.8 million as of September 30, 2024. We had restricted cash of 10.5 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Our restricted cash balance includes cash sweeps for 1140 Avenue of the Americas of 3.1 million and 2.5 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the remaining balance of restricted cash is comprised of various escrow accounts and other cash accounts with restricted uses. We are able to use a portion of our restricted cash for certain property operating expenses and capital expenditures. For certain property operating expenses and capital expenditures specifically related to our 1140 Avenue of the Americas property, lender approval is required to use any of the cash that is held in restricted cash accounts resulting from the breach of covenants on the loan secured by that property (see below). As a result, some of the property operating expenses and capital expenditures that will be paid with restricted cash may reside in accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Segregated Cash Accounts - Loan Covenant Breaches The continuing adverse economic impacts since the COVID-19 pandemic have caused and may continue to cause certain of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the amount of cash we receive from our operations and therefore our ability to fund operating expenses and other capital requirements. Beginning in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the operating results at some of our properties, including our 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 8713 Fifth Avenue properties, were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic causing cash trap events under the non-recourse mortgages, where excess operating cash flow from the property, if any, after debt service was held in restricted cash as additional collateral for the loan, for those properties to be triggered. Thus, we were not able to use excess cash flow, if any, from these properties to fund operating expenses at our other properties and other capital requirements during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we are operating under two cash traps at both 1140 Avenue of the Americas and 8713 Fifth Avenue, which together, represent 23 of the rentable square feet in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 3.1 million and 2.5 million, respectively, of cash maintained in a segregated and restricted cash account resulting from the breach of covenants on the loan secured by our 1140 Avenue of the Americas property. The remaining cash that is

Table of Contents 
 classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet are held in escrow accounts. As of September 30, 2024 our 8713 Fifth Avenue property has not generated excess cash after debt service and there is no related cash maintained in a segregated and restricted cash account for that property. We may not access the cash from the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property without lender approval unless and until the various breaches have been cured. Excess cash generated by the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property continues to be deposited in a separate cash management account until the borrower under the loan is able to comply with all of the applicable covenants. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we are operating under two cash sweeps at our 9 Times Square and 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. properties. Under these lease sweep periods, any excess cash generated, if any, is to be held in a segregated reserve account controlled by the lender as additional collateral. This swept cash is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024 we had 3.1 million retained by the lender in a restricted cash account for our 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. property. For additional information please see Note 4 Mortgage Notes Payable to our consolidated financials statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Financings We define our leverage as the ratio between our net debt, which is calculated as our gross debt of 399.5 million less cash and cash equivalents of 5.2 million divided by our gross asset value, which is calculated as the carrying value of our total assets of 567.9 million plus our accumulated depreciation and amortization of 87.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, our net debt was 394.3 million, our gross asset value was 655.8 million and our leverage was 60.1 . As of September 30, 2024 our gross borrowings totaled 399.5 million, which bore interest at a weighted-average annual rate of 4.90 and had a weighted-average maturity of 2.5 years. All of our properties are encumbered under mortgage notes payable, and are not available to satisfy other debts and obligations, or to serve as collateral with respect to new indebtedness, as applicable, unless the existing indebtedness associated with the property is satisfied. We do not currently have a commitment for a corporate-level revolving credit facility or any other corporate-level indebtedness, and there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain corporate-level financing on favorable terms, or at all. Mortgage Notes Payable We had six mortgage loans secured by our seven properties with an aggregate balance of 399.5 million as of September 30, 2024 with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.90 . All our mortgage loans bear interest at a fixed rate, except for our 9 Times Square mortgage note payable which bears interest at an annual variable interest rate of 30-day SOFR plus 2.60 . The 9 Times Square mortgage note was effectively fixed at 3.73 by an interest rate swap derivative instrument prior to its maturity in April 2024. There are no future scheduled principal payments on our mortgage notes payable for the remainder of 2024. In October 2024 we exercised the option in the 9 Times Square mortgage note to extend the maturity of this mortgage note payable to January 2025. This loan had a principal balance of 49.5 million. Unless the 9 Times Square mortgage note payable is further extended, we would not have any future scheduled principal payments for the year ended December 31, 2025. Debt Covenant Non-Compliance 1140 Avenue of the Americas We have breached both a debt service coverage provision and a reserve fund provision under our non-recourse mortgage secured by the 1140 Avenue of the Americas property in each of the last 17 quarters ended September 30, 2024. The principal amount of the loan was 99.0 million as of September 30, 2024. These breaches are not events of default, rather they require excess cash, if any, generated at the property (after paying operating costs, debt service and capital/tenant replacement reserves) to be held in a segregated account as additional collateral under the loan. The covenants for this loan may be cured if we satisfy the required debt service coverage ratio for two consecutive quarters, whereupon the additional collateral will be released. We can remain subject to this reserve requirement through maturity of the loan without further penalty or ramifications. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had 3.1 million and 2.5 million in cash that is retained by the lender and maintained in restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of those dates.

Table of Contents 
 8713 Fifth Avenue We have breached a debt service coverage ratio covenant under the non-recourse mortgage secured by 8713 Fifth Avenue in each of the last 17 quarters ended September 30, 2024. The principal amount for the loan was 10.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The breach of this covenant did not result in an event of default but rather triggered an excess cash flow sweep period. The excess cash flow sweep period will continue until the covenant breaches are cured in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. This property has not generated any excess cash since the breach occurred and thus no cash has ever been trapped related to this property. Additionally, in the event that the debt service coverage ratio covenant remains in breach at or below the current level for two consecutive calendar quarters and the lender reasonably determines that such breach is due to the property being imprudently managed by the current manager, the lender has the right, but not the obligation, to require that we replace the current manager with a third party manager chosen by us. Cash Sweep Events 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. We entered a lease sweep period under the non-recourse mortgage secured by 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from a near-maturity lease with a major tenant at the property set to expire in the third quarter of 2024. The principal amount for the loan was 50.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Under the loan agreement, a lease sweep period is triggered when (i) the date that is twelve months prior to the end of the term of the major lease, (ii) the date required by the major tenant to give notice of its exercise of a renewal option, (iii) any major tenant lease is surrendered or terminated prior to the expiration date, (iv) if the major tenant discontinues its operations and the major tenants long term debt is not rated lower than investment grade, (v) any material default under the major tenant s lease, (vi) any major tenant insolvency proceeding. Under the lease sweep period, any excess cash generated, if any, is to be held in a segregated reserve account controlled by the lender as additional collateral. As of September 30, 2024 we had 3.1 million retained by the lender in a restricted cash account on our consolidated balance sheet. We may exit the lease sweep period when the major tenant executes a renewal or extension option beyond the terms described above. 9 Times Square On April 29, 2024, we entered a cash sweep period under the non-recourse mortgage secured by the 9 Times Square asset pursuant to an amendment which, among other things, extends the maturity of the loan from April 2024 to October 2024. The amendment provides that Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Amendment) shall be deposited to an account maintained by the Administrative Agent within ten (10) calendar days of the end of each month. As of September 30, 2024, we had 25,000 cash retained by the lender in a restricted cash account on our consolidated balance sheet. Other Debt Covenants We were in compliance with the remaining covenants under our other mortgage notes payable as of September 30, 2024, and we continue to monitor compliance with those provisions. If we experience additional lease terminations, due to tenant bankruptcies or otherwise, or tenants placed on a cash basis revenue recognition continue to not pay rent, it is possible that certain of the covenants on other loans may be breached and we may also become restricted from accessing excess cash flows from those properties. Similar to the loans discussed above, our other mortgages also contain cash management provisions that are not considered events of default, and as such, acceleration of principal would only occur upon an event of default. Note Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to the terms of a promissory note executed during the three months ended June 30, 2024 between us and the Advisor, we borrowed 0.15 million from the Advisor for working capital needs, which was recorded as a note payable to related parties as of June 30, 2024 on our consolidated balance sheet. The promissory note bore interest at an annual rate of 9.39 and would have been callable on or after September 26, 2024. In July 2024, we fully repaid all amounts outstanding under the promissory note. Amounts repaid under the promissory note may not be reborrowed.

Assets Held For Sale During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell our 9 Times Square property for a contract sales price of 63.5 million. The sale is expected to be consummated no later than January 2025 and is classified as held for sale on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

Related Party Payments Made with Common Stock Issuances in Lieu of Cash During the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were also able to preserve cash through an arrangement with our Advisor. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor has the option to elect to receive shares of our common stock in lieu of cash for the asset management, property management, and administrative services it provides us with. For the months described below, the Company paid related party fees in shares in lieu of cash.

The changes in occupancy were as follows: Occupancy at 9 Times Square decreased to 70.6 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 71.2 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a lease amendment and relocation of a tenant to a smaller suite. Occupancy at 123 William Street decreased to 89.3 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 91.4 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in occupancy was due to a lease amendment and a tenant occupying less space during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Occupancy at 1140 Avenue of the Americas increased to 79.3 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 77.1 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in occupancy was the result of a new lease signed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Occupancy at 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd. was at 94.2 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 100 as of December 31, 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a tenant located at our 400 E. 67th Street/200 Riverside Blvd property vacated its current space, however, per their agreement with us, the tenant is required to pay rent for the remainder of term of their existing lease which is set to expire in the third quarter of 2025. Occupancy at our property located at 196 Orchard Street remained the same at 100 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Occupancy at 8713 Fifth Avenue remained the same at 88.6 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We continue to focus on increasing occupancy of the portfolio by seeking new and replacement tenants for leases that expired or otherwise have been terminated. We believe that certain market tenant incentives we have used and expect to continue to use, including free rent periods and tenant improvements, will support our occupancy rate and extend the average duration of our leases upon commencement of executed leases. These incentives have delayed, and may delay or reduce cash flow in the future for some period. Our ability to generate net cash from our property operations depends, in part on the amount of additional cash we can generate through new or renewal leases, which is not assured, and on our ability to access any excess cash we are able to generate from properties that are encumbered by mortgages where a cash trap event has occurred (see below for more details), which also is not assured. Capital Expenditures For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded an aggregate of 0.9 million of capital expenditures primarily for tenant and building improvements at 123 William Street, 9 Times Square, 1140 Avenue of the Americas, and 8713 Fifth Avenue. We may invest in additional capital expenditures to further enhance the value of our properties. Additionally, many of our lease agreements with tenants include provisions for tenant improvement allowances. We expect the amount we invest in capital expenditures during the full year ending December 31, 2024, including amounts we expect to fund under new or replacement leases, will be lower when compared to the amount invested during the year ended December 31, 2023. However, this could change if management deems necessary. We funded our capital expenditures during the three months ended September 30, 2024 with cash on hand consisting of proceeds from previous offerings/financings and, cash retained from the Advisor by electing to receive shares of our Class A common stock in lieu of cash for its base management fee for March 2024.

 Acquisitions and Dispositions To further augment our liquidity, we may also further dispose of properties. We had no acquisitions or dispositions during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, other than the activity described below. We have executed one purchase and sale agreement, pursuant to the terms of an amendment to the mortgage note payable which encumbers the property, to dispose of our 9 Times Square property for a contract purchase price of 63.5 million, which we expect to occur no later than January 2025. We evaluated this asset for held for sale classification and determined that it qualified for held for sale treatment based on our accounting policies. As a result, the asset is presented on the assets held for sale line item on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to sell our 421 W. 54th Street - Hit Factory property for 4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We closed the sale on October 12, 2023. We evaluated this asset for held for sale classification and determined that it qualified for held for sale treatment based on our accounting policies, therefore, it is presented on the assets held for sale line item on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The sole tenant terminated its lease early and vacated the space during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This section discusses the non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA as well as adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are both non-GAAP metrics and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than other metrics calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, including net loss, in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than non-GAAP metrics. We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA useful indicators of our performance. Because these metrics calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, interest expense, impairment charges, equity-based compensation, gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), these metrics presentations facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other companies that use these measures. As a result, we believe that the use of these non-GAAP metrics together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance, including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. However, these non-GAAP metrics are not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to pay cash dividends and capital expenditures. Investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP metrics should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as they exclude certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) impairment charges, (v) interest income and other income or expense, (vi) gains or losses on debt extinguishment, (vii) equity-based compensation expense, (vii) acquisition and transaction costs, (viii) gain or loss on asset sales and (ix) and expenses paid with issuances of our common stock in lieu of cash.

 The below table presents a reconciliation of our EBITDA and our adjusted EBITDA from net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss and net loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) (34,482) (9,390) (133,941) (32,047) Interest expense 5,279 4,739 15,177 14,109 Tax expense (benefit) Depreciation and amortization 4,414 6,499 14,826 20,200 EBITDA (24,789) 1,848 (103,938) 2,262 Impairment of real estate investments 27,817 362 112,541 513 Equity-based compensation 76 1,208 316 5,712 Other income (9) (8) (27) (27) Management fees paid in common stock to the Advisor in lieu of cash 1,610 485 Adjusted EBITDA 3,095 3,410 10,502 8,945 Dividends As noted above, we have not paid dividends to stockholders since those that were declared and paid through the six months ended June 30, 2022. Decisions regarding the frequency and amount of any future dividends we pay on our Class A common stock are entirely at the discretion of our board of directors. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on our ability to operate profitably and to generate sufficient cash flows from the operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular basis on our Class A common stock or any other class or series of stock we may issue in the future. There is no assurance we will reinstitute the payment dividends at the previous rate, or at all. The amount of dividends we may pay to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors based on several factors, including funds available for dividends, our financial condition, provisions in our loans and any agreement we are party to that may restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, and requirements of Maryland law. Previous Election as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT, effective commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Our board subsequently authorized the termination of our REIT election which became effective on January 1, 2023. We believe that during the taxable year ended December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2022, we were organized and operated in a manner so that we qualified as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT during that period, we were required to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and comply with several other organizational and operational requirements. As a REIT, we were generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distributed to our stockholders. A tax loss for a particular year eliminated the need to distribute REIT taxable income to meet the 90 distribution requirement for that year and minimized or eliminated the need to pay distributions to meet the distribution requirement in one or more subsequent years. We had a loss for tax purposes in the year ending December 31, 2022 and therefore there was no REIT taxable income requiring distribution to maintain our qualification as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Inflation We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions, or those leases which have escalations at rates which do not exceed or approximate current inflation rates. As of September 30, 2024, the increase to the 12-month CPI for all items, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 2.4 . To help mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, approximately 82 of our leases with our tenants contain rent escalation provisions which increase the cash rent that is due under these leases over time by an average cumulative increase of 2.1 per year. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or other measures. As of September 30, 2024, based on straight-line rent, approximately 82 are fixed rate, scheduled escalation increases recorded on a straight-line basis, and 18 do not contain any escalation provisions. In addition, we may be required to pay costs for maintenance and operation of properties which may adversely impact our results of operations due to potential increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. Currently, the impact of inflation has had an immaterial impact to operating costs. However, to the extent such costs exceed the tenants base year, certain but not all of our leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. As the costs of general goods and services continue to rise, we may be adversely impacted by increases in general and administrative costs due to overall inflation. Related-Party Transactions and Agreements Please see Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There has been no material change in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Any of the terms of any class or series of Shares set or changed pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 5.4 may be made dependent upon facts or events ascertainable outside the Charter (including determinations by the Board or other facts or events 

 within the control of the Company) and may vary among holders thereof, provided that the manner in which such facts, events or variations shall operate upon the terms of such class or series of Shares is clearly and expressly set forth in the articles supplementary or other Charter document.

The terms Beneficial Owner, Beneficially Owns and Beneficially Owned shall have the correlative meanings.

(A)(1) Except as set forth in any articles supplementary creating any class or series of Shares, no Person, other than an Excepted Holder, shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and (2) no Excepted Holder shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Shares in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder. (B) No Person shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares to the extent that such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares would result in the Company being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership that would result in the Company actually owning or Constructively Owning an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Company from such tenant would cause the Company to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code). 

 (C) Any Transfer of Shares that, if effective, would result in the Shares being Beneficially Owned by fewer than 100 Persons (as determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. (II) TRANSFER IN TRUST . If any Transfer of Shares occurs which, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning Shares in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B), (A) then that number of Shares the Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 5.7(iii), effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such Person shall acquire no rights in such Shares; or (B) if the transfer to the Trust described in this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) then the transfer of that number of Shares that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares. To the extent that, upon a transfer of Shares pursuant to this Section 5.7(iii)(a)(II), a violation of any provision of this Section 5.7 would nonetheless be continuing (for example where the ownership of Shares by a single Trust would violate the 100 stockholder requirement applicable to REITs), then Shares shall be transferred to the number of Trusts, each having a distinct Trustee and one or more Charitable Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each other Trust, such that there is no violation of any provision of this Section 5.7. (b) REMEDIES FOR BREACH . If the Board shall at any time determine that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any Shares in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem Shares, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) shall automatically result in the 

 transfer to the Trust described above, and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event) shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board. (c) NOTICE OF RESTRICTED TRANSFER . Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares that will or may violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) or any Person who would have owned Shares that resulted in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II), shall immediately give written notice to the Company of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice to the Company, and shall provide to the Company such other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer on the Company s status as a REIT. (d) OWNERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION . Prior to the Restriction Termination Date: (I) every owner of more than five percent (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of the outstanding Shares, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of Shares Beneficially Owned and a description of the manner in which such Shares are held. Each such owner shall provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the Company s status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit; and (II) each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Shares and each Person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding Shares for a Beneficial Owner or a Constructive Owner shall provide to the Company such information as the Company may request, in good faith, in order to determine the Company s status as a REIT and to comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance. (e) REMEDIES NOT LIMITED . Subject to Section 7.4 hereof, nothing contained in this Section 5.7(ii)(e) shall limit the authority of the Board to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Company and the interests of its Stockholders in preserving the Company s status as a REIT. (f) AMBIGUITY . In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 5.7(ii), Section 5.7(iii), or any definition contained in Section 5.7(i), the Board shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 5.7(ii) or 

 Section 5.7(iii) or any such definition with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it. In the event Section 5.7(ii) or (iii) requires an action by the Board and the Charter fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 5.7. Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board (which the Board may make in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 5.7(ii)(b)) acquired Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a), such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the Shares which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who actually own such Shares based upon the relative number of the Shares held by each such Person. (g) EXCEPTIONS . (I) Subject to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B), the Board, in its sole discretion, may (prospectively or retroactively) exempt a Person from the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and may establish or increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such Person if: (A) the Board obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain that no individual s Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of such Shares will violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B); (B) such Person does not, and represents that it will not, actually own or Constructively Own an interest in a tenant of the Company (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by the Company) that would cause the Company to actually own or Constructively Own more than a 9.9 interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant and the Board obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain this fact (for this purpose, a tenant from whom the Company (or an entity owned or controlled by the Company) derives (and is expected to continue to derive) a sufficiently small amount of revenue such that, in the opinion of the Board, rent from such tenant would not adversely affect the Company s ability to qualify as a REIT, shall not be treated as a tenant of the Company); and (C) such Person agrees that any violation or attempted violation of such representations or undertakings (or other action which is contrary to the restrictions contained in Section 5.7(ii)(a) through Section 5.7(ii)(f)) will result in such Shares being automatically Transferred to a Trust in accordance with Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II) and Section 5.7(iii). 

 (II) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(g)(I), the Board may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board in its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Company s status as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exception. (III) Subject to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B), an underwriter which participates in an offering or a private placement of Shares (or Securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares (or Securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such offering or private placement. (IV) The Board may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder: (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any time, or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No Excepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit. (h) INCREASE OR DECREASE IN AGGREGATE SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMIT . Subject to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B), the Board may from time to time increase the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit for one or more Persons and decrease the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit for all other Persons; provided, however, that the decreased Aggregate Share Ownership Limit will not be effective for any Person whose percentage ownership of Shares is in excess of such decreased Aggregate Share Ownership Limit until such time as such Person s percentage of Shares equals or falls below the decreased Aggregate Share Ownership Limit, but any further acquisition of Shares in excess of such percentage ownership of Shares will be in violation of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and, provided further, that the new Aggregate Share Ownership Limit would not allow five or fewer Persons to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own more than 49.9 in value of the outstanding Shares. (i) NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS UPON ISSUANCE OR TRANSFER . Upon issuance or Transfer of Shares prior to the Restriction Termination Date, the Company shall provide the recipient with a notice containing information about the Shares purchased or otherwise Transferred, in lieu of issuance of a share certificate, in a form substantially similar to the following:

Any Person who Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns or attempts to Beneficially or Constructively Own Shares which causes or will cause a Person to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares in excess or in violation of the above limitations must immediately give written notice (or, in the case of an attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice) to the Company. If any of the restrictions on Transfer or ownership as set forth in (i) and (ii) above are violated, the Shares in excess or in violation of the above limitations will be automatically transferred to a Trustee of a Trust for the benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries.

AMERICAN STRATEGIC INVESTMENT CO. ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY FOR SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK (Pursuant to Sections 2-105, 2-201(c) and 2-208 of the Maryland General Corporation Law) American Strategic Investment Co., a Maryland corporation (the Company ), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland that: FIRST: Under a power contained in Section 5.1 of the charter of the Company (the Charter ), the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board ), by duly adopted resolutions, reclassified and designated fifteen thousand (15,000) authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Company as shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share, with the following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, which, upon any restatement of the Charter, shall become part of Article V of the Charter, with any necessary or appropriate renumbering or relettering of the sections or subsections hereof. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Charter. 

 Section 1. Number of Shares and Designation . A series of preferred stock of the Company designated as Series A Preferred Stock is hereby established, and the number shares constituting such series shall be fifteen thousand (15,000). Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors and by the filing of Articles Supplementary in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law and the acceptance for record thereof by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland; provided , that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Company convertible into Series A Preferred Stock. Section 2. Dividends and other Distributions . (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any class or series of preferred stock (or any other stock of the Company) ranking senior to or on a parity with the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of any class or series of stock of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in respect thereof, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Company out of funds legally available therefor, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which quarter ended January, April, July and October in each year (each such date a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date ), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount (if any) per share (rounded to the nearest cent), subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 multiplied by the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 multiplied by the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Class A Common Stock ), of the Company or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Class A Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Class A Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) The Company shall declare a dividend or other distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section 2 immediately after it declares a 

 dividend or other distribution on the Class A Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock). (C) Dividends due pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section 2 shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. (D) In determining whether a dividend or other distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise, is permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend or other distribution, to satisfy the preferential right upon dissolution of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Company s total liabilities. Section 3. Voting Rights . The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Class A Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the terms of any other class or series of preferred stock or any similar stock or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Company 

 having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company. (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise required by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Class A Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. Section 4. Certain Restrictions . (A) Whenever one or more quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not authorized or declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Company shall not: (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or (iii) except pursuant to provisions of the Charter or Bylaws of the Company providing for limitations or restrictions on ownership of securities of the Company which are, expressly or by implication, included to protect the status of the Corporation as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Company ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company ranking junior (as to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock. (B) The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Company unless the Company could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. Section 5. Reacquired Shares . All shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall constitute authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be classified, reclassified or issued as any series or class of preferred stock. Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up . 

 (A) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, voluntary or otherwise, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received an amount per share (the Series A Liquidation Preference ), subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 multiplied by the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Class A Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) If there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other classes and series of stock of the Company, if any, that rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in respect thereof, then the assets available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. (C) Neither the merger or consolidation of the Company into or with another entity nor the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the Company shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company within the meaning of this Section 6. Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, Etc. If the Company shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Class A Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 multiplied by the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Class A Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Class A Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such 

 event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Section 8. Amendment . At any time that any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Charter shall not be amended in any manner, including in a merger, consolidation or otherwise, which would materially and adversely alter, change or repeal the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications or terms and conditions of redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class. Section 9. Rank . The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up, junior to all other classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Company, unless the terms of any such other class or series shall provide otherwise, and shall rank senior to the Class A Common Stock as to such matters. Section 10. Ownership Restrictions . The Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in Section 5.7 of the Charter. Section 11. Permissible Distributions . In determining whether a distribution (other than upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), whether by dividend, or upon redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise, is permitted under Maryland law, amounts that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of any class or series of stock whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior or prior to those receiving the distribution shall not be added to the Company s total liabilities. SECOND: The Series A Preferred Stock has been classified and designated by the Board under the authority contained in the Charter. THIRD: These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the manner and by the vote required by law. FOURTH: The undersigned acknowledges these Articles Supplementary to be the corporate act of the Company and, as to all matters or facts required to be verified under oath, the undersigned acknowledges that, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, these matters and facts are true in all material respects and that this statement is made under the penalties for perjury.
