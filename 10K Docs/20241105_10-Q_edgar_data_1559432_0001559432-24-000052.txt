 November 2021 Credit Facility 
 On August 30, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 4 and Borrowing Base Agreement Amendment No. 4 on our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility with certain commercial banks, as the lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent. We use the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. Amendment No. 4 extended the maturity date of the Credit Facility to August 30, 2028, increased the borrowing base from million to million and joined certain new Lenders to the Credit Facility. In connection with the Credit Facility, we incurred financing fees and expenses, which are included in other assets on the balance sheets, of approximately million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023 before accumulated amortization of million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. We incurred million of financing fees and expenses in conjunction with Amendment No. 4. These costs are being amortized over the life of the credit facility. Such amortized expenses are recorded as interest expense on the statements of operations. 
 Redeterminations of the borrowing base under the Credit Facility, are based primarily on reserve reports that reflect commodity prices at such time, and occur semi-annually, in March and September, as well as upon request by the lenders at their sole discretion, no more than once per period. We also have the right to request up to additional borrowing base redeterminations each year at our discretion. Significant declines in commodity prices may result in a decrease in the borrowing base. These borrowing base declines can be offset by any commodity price hedges we enter. Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Partnership, including, without limitation, (i) our interest in the joint venture, (ii) all our deposit accounts, securities accounts, and commodities accounts, (iii) any

 to 1.0 and current assets shall include availability under the Credit Facility but shall exclude the fair value of derivative instruments and current liabilities shall exclude the fair value of derivative instruments and any advances under the Credit Facility and (ii) a ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDAX of not greater than to 1.0. For purposes of the total net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio Leverage Ratio ), total net debt includes total debt for borrowed money (including capital leases and purchase money debt), minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand at such time (not exceeding million in the aggregate), minus the unpaid balance of the FAM Loan. EBITDAX means sum of (i) net income plus interest expense; income taxes paid; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expenses, including workover expenses; non-cash charges including unrealized losses on derivative instruments; and, any extraordinary or non-recurring charges, minus (ii) any extraordinary or non-recurring income and any non-cash income including unrealized gains on derivative instruments. Effective with the Second Amendment, our hedge requirements are based on availability under the Credit Facility and the Leverage Ratio. If the Leverage Ratio is greater than to 1.00, we are required to hedge at l east of reasonably anticipated projected production of proved developed producing reserves for the months following the end of the most recent quarter. If the Leverage Ratio is less than to 1.00 and availability under the Credit Facility is greater than of the then current borrowing base, the minimum required hedge volume would be for the months following the end of the most recent quarter. If the Leverage Ratio is less than to 1.00 and availability under the Credit Facility is greater than of the then current borrowing base, there would be no minimum required hedge volume. Our Credit Facility prohibits us from hedging more than of our reasonably projected production for any fiscal year. Under the terms of the Credit Facility as amended, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, we believe we have adequate liquidity to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the date of this report. 
 At our election, interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is determined by reference to either the secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus an applicable margin between and per annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowings under the Credit Facility) or the alternate base rate ABR plus an applicable margin between and per annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowings under the Credit Facility). Interest is generally payable quarterly for loans bearing interest based on the ABR and at the end of the applicable interest period (either one, three or six months) for loans bearing interest at SOFR. We are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility, which accrues at a rate per annum of on the average daily unused amount of the lesser of: (i) the maximum commitment amount of the lenders and (ii) the then-effective borrowing base. 
 September 2016 Loan 
 On September 30, 2016, TXO Partners entered into an unsecured loan agreement with Cross Timbers Energy (the FAM Loan ). The proceeds for the loan were taken from the cash held by the offshore subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation and the loan was assigned to the offshore subsidiary (Note 6). The loan matures on November 29, 2028, but is automatically extended should the maturity date of the Credit Facility be extended. In all instances, this loan will mature after the maturity of the Credit Facility. Interest on the loan is the lesser of (a) London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus three and one-quarter of one percent per annum, adjusted monthly or (b) the highest rate permitted by applicable law. Though the note is unsecured, we are required to stay in compliance with terms of the Credit Facility.

 ownership interest in investment assets at Cross Timbers Energy, had a note receivable totaling million outstanding with a highly-rated, offshore subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, there is no stated maturity date and Cross Timbers Energy may demand repayment of all or any portion of the outstanding balance on business days notice. Interest is earned based on the one-month SOFR rate and is paid monthly. Interest income totaled million in the first nine months of 2024 and million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 The note receivable is treated as a non-current asset, since Cross Timbers Energy does not have any intention of demanding repayment of all or any portion of the outstanding balance at this time. Repayment would require the approval of the Cross Timbers Energy MMC.

 The fair value of our note receivable from related party approximates the carrying amount because the interest rate is based on current market interest rates and can be called upon business days notice (Note 6). The fair value of our long-term debt approximates the carrying amount because the interest rate is reset periodically at then current market rates (Note 5). 
 The fair value of our note receivable from related party (Note 6), derivative asset/(liability) (Note 10) and our long-term debt (Note 5) is measured using Level 2 inputs, and are determined by either market prices on an active market for

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable and are based upon Level 3 inputs. These assets and liabilities can include assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligations and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired. Such fair value estimates require assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities, the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability, what constitutes adequate restoration, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, and consideration of changes in legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. 
 We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. We review our oil and natural gas properties by asset group. The estimated future net cash flows are based upon the underlying reserves and anticipated future pricing. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of a particular asset, the Partnership recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of such assets. The fair value of the proved properties is measured based on the income approach, which incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future product prices, which the Partnership bases on the forward-price curves, estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and capital costs and a risk adjusted discount rate of . These inputs are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Commodity Price Hedging Instruments 
 We periodically enter into futures contracts, energy swaps, swaptions, costless collars and basis swaps to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales. When actual commodity prices exceed the fixed price provided by these contracts we pay this excess to the counterparty, and when the commodity prices are below the contractually provided fixed price, we receive this difference from the counterparty. See Note 10.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies, pipeline companies, marketing companies, local distribution companies and end-users in various industries. Letters of credit or other appropriate security are obtained as considered necessary to limit risk of loss from the other companies. Including the bank that issued the letter of credit, we currently have greater concentrations of credit with several investment-grade (BBB- or better) rated companies.

 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Some of the information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, words such as may, assume, forecast, could, should, will, plan, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect, project, budget and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events at the time such statement was made. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Risk Factors included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL. We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations as discussed under Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statement include: 
 
 commodity price volatility; 
 
 the impact of epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events, and the related effects on financial markets, worldwide economic activity and our operations; 
 
 uncertainties about our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, including the impact of commodity price declines on the economic producibility of such reserves, and in projecting future rates of production; 
 
 risks related to the Williston Acquisitions, including the risk that we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the Williston Acquisitions; 
 
 the concentration of our operations in the Permian Basin, the San Juan Basin and the Williston Basin; 
 
 difficult and adverse conditions in the domestic and global capital and credit markets; 
 
 lack of transportation and storage capacity as a result of oversupply, government regulations or other factors; 
 
 lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services; 
 
 potential financial losses or earnings reductions resulting from our commodity price risk management program or any inability to manage our commodity risks; 
 
 failure to realize expected value creation from property acquisitions and trades;

access to capital and the timing of development expenditures; 
 
 environmental, weather, drilling and other operating risks; 
 
 regulatory changes, including potential shut-ins or production curtailments mandated by the Railroad Commission of Texas; 
 
 competition in the oil and natural gas industry; 
 
 loss of production and leasehold rights due to mechanical failure or depletion of wells and our inability to re-establish their production; 
 
 our ability to service our indebtedness; 
 
 cost inflation; 
 
 political and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing countries, including embargoes, the Israel-Hamas war, attacks in the Red Sea and other continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, the armed conflict in Ukraine and associated economic sanctions on Russia, conditions in South America, Central America, China and Russia, and acts of terrorism or sabotage; 
 
 evolving cybersecurity risks such as those involving unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees, insider or other with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks, ransomware, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions; and 
 
 risks related to our ability to expand our business, including through the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. 
 
 Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reservoir engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, our reserve and PV-10 estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. 
 
 Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q occur, or should underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. 
 
 All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. 
 
 Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, optimization and exploitation of conventional oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves in North America. Our properties are predominately located in the Permian Basin of New Mexico and Texas, the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado and the Williston Basin of Montana and North Dakota .

 Recent Developments 
 
 Williston Basin Acquisitions 
 In August 2024, we completed the acquisition of producing properties from Eagle Mountain Energy Partners and VR 4-ELM,LP, located in the Elm Coulee field in Montana and the Russian Creek field in North Dakota which are part of the Greater Williston Basin, for cash consideration of 241.8 million and 2.5 million common units of TXO valued at 50.0 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was funded by a combination of cash on hand from the Offering and borrowings under our Credit Facility 
 
 Additionally, in August 2024, we completed the acquisition of producing properties from Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in the Russian Creek field in North Dakota for cash consideration of 18.2 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The KFOC Acquisition was funded by cash on hand from the Offering. 
 
 Equity Offering 
 On June 28, 2024, we completed the Offering for the sale of 6.5 million common units at a price of 20.00 per common unit, which resulted in proceeds of 122.5 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other costs. On July 2, 2024, we completed the sale of an additional 975,000 common units at a price of 20.00 per common unit pursuant to the underwriter s exercise in full of its option to purchase additional common units in the Offering, resulting in additional proceeds of 18.7 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other costs . We used the net proceeds from the Offering to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Williston Acquisitions. 
 
 Market Outlook 
 The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices are highly volatile. For example, during the period from January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, NYMEX prices for crude oil and natural gas reached a high of 93.68 per Bbl and 4.17 per MMBtu, respectively, and a low of 65.75 per Bbl and 1.58 per MMBtu, respectively. Oil prices were relatively stable over the first half of 2023 before initially increasing in the second half of 2023 as a result of expected supply constraints and hostilities in the Middle East. Since these concerns did not materialize, oil prices declined in December 2023 but continuing hostilities and higher global consumption pushed prices higher in the first half of 2024. However, increased supply led to lower prices in the third quarter of 2024. WTI crude oil prices have been volatile reaching a high of 93.68 per Bbl in September 2023 before declining to 69.22 per Bbl as of October 18, 2024. Natural gas prices reached a high of 4.17 per MMbtu in January 2023 before declining to 2.26 per MMbtu as of October 18, 2024. 
 We expect the crude oil and natural gas markets will continue to be volatile in the future. Our revenue, profitability and future growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Please see Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Industry and Our Business--Commodity prices are volatile--A sustained decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. 
 
 With our anticipated cash flows from our long-lived property base, we intend to provide allocation of funds to prudently meet our goals. These goals include the highest projected economic returns on our capital budget, acquisition opportunities that fulfill our strategy, and cash distributions for the life of our legacy assets. From time to time, we may choose to amortize repayment of debt incurred to support the longer-term financial stewardship of our business. At other times, given fluctuations in industry costs and commodity prices, we may modify our capital budget or cash balances to shift funds towards cash distributions. We will use all of these tools to support our underlying strategy as a production and distribution enterprise. 
 
 Concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, supply chain disruptions, increased demand, labor shortages associated with a fully employed U.S. labor force, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and the United States financial market and other factors have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the U.S. economy experienced the highest rate of inflation in the past 40 years. Rising inflation has been pervasive since 2022, increasing the cost of salaries, wages, supplies, material, freight, and energy. While we have seen inflation moderate in 2024, inflation continues to run higher 
 18

 than the Federal Reserve target, resulting in higher costs. We continue to undertake actions and implement plans to address these pressures and protect the requisite access to commodities and services, however, these mitigation efforts may not succeed or be insufficient. Nevertheless, we expect for the foreseeable future to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure. Principally, commodity costs for steel and chemicals required for drilling, higher transportation and fuel costs and wage increases have increased our operating costs. We do not expect these cost increases to reverse in the short term. Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase, so do associated costs. Conversely, in a period of declining prices, associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion to prices. We cannot predict the future inflation rate but to the extent these higher costs do not begin to reverse or start to increase again, we may experience a higher cost environment going forward. If we are unable to recover higher costs through higher commodity prices, our current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations, impairment assessments of oil and natural gas properties, and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions would all be significantly impacted. 
 
 Prior to our completion of the EMEP Acquisition in August 2024, EMEP incurred approximately 40 million of development capital on their planned program. At the time of the acquisition, there were several incomplete EMEP projects we expect to complete during the balance of the year. While it is too early to determine the full success of the EMEP capital program, we expect the average daily production on the Williston assets to consist of approximately 78 oil, 12 NGLs and 10 gas. We have hedged a portion of our underlying production to protect our distributions and the balance sheet. 
 
 Our borrowings under our Credit Facility of 148 million were incurred to partially fund the EMEP Acquisition. This has resulted in an increase to our net-debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAX ratio to approximately one times, which is in compliance with our debt covenants. 
 
 As a result of the Williston Acquisitions, we increased our total leasehold and mineral acreage from approximately 846,000 gross (372,000 net) to approximately 1,120,000 gross (550,000 net). 
 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our operations, including: 
 production volumes; 
 realized prices on the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas; 
 production expenses; 
 acquisition and development expenditures; 
 Adjusted EBITDAX; and 
 Cash Available for Distribution. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAX 
 
 We include in this Quarterly Report the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDAX and provide our calculation of Adjusted EBITDAX and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to net income (loss), our most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (4) impairment expenses, (5) accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations, (6) exploration expenses, (7) unrealized (gains) losses on commodity derivative contracts, (8) non-cash incentive compensation, (9) non-cash (gain) loss on forgiveness of debt and (10) certain other non-cash expenses. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAX is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies and others, to more effectively evaluate 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 our operating performance and our results of operation from period to period and against our peers without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or as indicators of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax burden, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDAX. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Cash Available for Distribution 
 
 Cash available for distribution is not a measure of net income or net cash flow provided by or used in operating activities as determined by GAAP. Cash available for distribution is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, lenders and others (including industry analysts and rating agencies who will be using such measure), to assess our ability to internally fund our exploration and development activities, pay distributions, and to service or incur additional debt. We define cash available for distribution as Adjusted EBITDAX less net cash interest expense, exploration expense, non-recurring (gain) / loss and development costs. Development costs include all of our capital expenditures made for oil and gas properties, other than acquisitions. Cash available for distribution will not reflect changes in working capital balances. Cash available for distribution is not a measurement of our financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net cash provided by or used in operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as indicators of our financial performance and liquidity. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to cash available for distribution are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or net cash provided by operating activities. 
 
 You should not infer from our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX that its results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDAX or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDAX and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

 _________________________________ 
 (1) Oil and condensate prices include both realized losses and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives. Unrealized gains were 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and unrealized losses were 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Realized losses were 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (2) Natural gas liquids prices include both realized losses and unrealized losses from derivatives. Unrealized losses were 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Realized losses were 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (3) Natural gas prices include both realized losses and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives. Unrealized losses were 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and unrealized gains were 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Realized losses were 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenues 
 Revenues decreased 1.1 million, or 2 , from 69.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 68.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue decreased 8.7 million as a result of a decrease in the average selling price, excluding the effects of derivatives, on natural gas of 40 and 5.1 million as a result of a decrease in the average selling price, excluding the effects of derivatives, on oil of 11 . These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 7.4 million due to an increase in production of 1 MBoe primarily as a result of increased oil production of 116 MBbls and increased NGL production of 16 MBbls due to production from the Williston Basin Acquisitions partially offset by natural declines and downtime. This increased production was partially offset by decreased natural gas production of 788 MMcf primarily due to natural declines. Additionally, gains on our hedging activity of 4.5 million, of which 1.0 million were unrealized gains and 3.5 million were realized gains and an increase in the average selling price, excluding the effects of derivatives, on NGLs of 12 resulted in an increase in revenue of 0.7 million. 
 Production expenses 
 Production expenses increased 3.8 million, or 11 , from 35.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 39.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to costs from the Williston Basin Acquisitions. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 On a per unit basis, production expenses increased from 16.95 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 18.73 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to having a higher percentage of oil production, which is more expensive on a Boe basis than natural gas production. 
 Taxes, transportation, and other 
 Taxes, transportation, and other decreased 0.8 million, or 5 , from 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower natural gas and oil prices partially offset by increased NGL prices and the increase in production. 
 On a per unit basis, taxes, transportation, and other decreased from 7.25 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.87 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily related to the lower natural gas and oil prices. 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased 3.0 million, or 28 , from 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to the Williston Basin production. 
 On a per unit basis, depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased from 5.05 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.45 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to the Williston Basin production which has a higher rate than the historical properties. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative G A expenses increased 1.5 million, or 87 , from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of 0.9 million due, in part, to amortization of unit awards and increased acquisition costs. 
 On a per unit basis, G A expense increased from 0.83 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.56 per Boe sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to increased costs partially offset by increased production. 
 Other income 
 Other income increased 1.1 million, or 22 , from 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to higher CO 2 and plant income of 1.1 million. The CO 2 and plant income is ancillary to the operations of the gas processing plant in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and CO 2 assets in Colorado. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 0.7 million, or 55 , from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowings and a higher interest rate.

Unrealized losses were 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and unrealized gains were 83.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Realized gains were 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and realized losses were 76.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenues 
 Revenues decreased 95.3 million, or 33 , from 288.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 193.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 67 decrease in the average selling price of natural gas, excluding the effects of derivatives, resulting in a decrease in revenue of 86.0 million, on oil of less than 1 resulting in a decrease in revenue of 0.5 million and on NGLs of 1 resulting in a decrease in revenue of 0.3 million. Additionally, revenue decreased 3.9 million due to a decrease in production of 145 MBoe primarily as a result of natural production declines and downtime partially offset by production from the Williston Basin Acquisitions. Finally, we incurred net losses on our hedging activity of 4.5 million, of which 88.4 million were unrealized losses and 83.9 million were realized gains. 
 Production expenses 
 Production expenses decreased 1.4 million, or 1 , from 110.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 109.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease is primarily due to decreased maintenance and energy costs partially offset by costs related to the Williston Basin Acquisitions. 
 On a per unit basis, production expenses increased from 17.64 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.84 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to costs related to the Williston Basin Acquisitions and the decrease in production partially offset by decreased maintenance and energy costs.

 Taxes, transportation, and other 
 Taxes, transportation, and other decreased 16.0 million, or 27 , from 59.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the decrease in production. 
 On a per unit basis, taxes, transportation, and other decreased from 9.47 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.07 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily related to the lower natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased 1.3 million, or 4 , from 33.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 34.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher rate, primarily due to Williston Basin production which has a higher rate than the historical properties, partially offset by decreased production. 
 On a per unit basis, depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased from 5.29 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.63 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to the Williston Basin production which has a higher rate than the historical properties. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative G A expenses increased 5.5 million, or 108 , from 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of 4.3 million due in part to amortization of unit awards and additional expenses related to being a public company. 
 On a per unit basis, G A expense increased from 0.81 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.72 per Boe sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to increased costs and decreased production. 
 Other income 
 Other income increased 10.4 million, or 57 , from 18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to 7.0 million in bonus payments on term assignment of leases, higher CO 2 and plant income of 2.6 million and a 0.8 million increase in marketing income. The CO 2 and plant income is ancillary to the operations of the gas processing plant in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and CO 2 assets in Colorado. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 0.6 million, or 19 , from 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to the increased borrowings and a higher interest rate. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital will be cash flows generated by operating activities and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility were 148.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 21.0 million at December 31, 2023, and the remaining availability under our Credit Facility was 127.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 144.0 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, we had negative net working capital (including cash and excluding the effects of derivative instruments) of 1.5 million at September 30, 2024 and positive net working capital (including cash and excluding the effects of derivative instruments) 14.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 On June 28, 2024, we completed the Offering, which resulted in proceeds of 122.5 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other costs. On July 2, 2024, we completed the sale of an additional 975,000 common units at 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 a price of 20.00 per common unit pursuant to the underwriter s exercise in full of its option to purchase additional common units in the Offering, resulting in additional proceeds of 18.7 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other costs . We used the net proceeds from the Offering to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Williston Acquisitions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 148.0 million outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and cash on hand of 3.8 million. These borrowings under our Credit Facility , which increased our net-debt-to-EBITDAX ratio to approximately one times, were incurred to fund the remainder of the Williston Basin Acquisitions. We expect to carry this level of debt moving forward. 
 Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement) to our unitholders. Our quarterly cash distributions may vary from quarter to quarter as a direct result of variations in the performance of our business, including those caused by fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas. Such variations may be significant and quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders may be zero. Our third quarter distribution of 0.58 per unit with respect to cash available for distribution for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was declared on November 5, 2024 and will be paid on November 22, 2024 to unitholders of record on November 15, 2024. 
 
 The fourth quarter distribution of 0.58 per unit with respect to cash available for distribution for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was paid on March 28, 2024 . The first quarter distribution of 0.65 per unit with respect to cash available for distribution for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was paid May 29, 2024 . The second quarter distribution of 0.57 per unit with respect to cash available for distribution for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was paid August 27, 2024. 
 Our acquisition and development expenditures consist of acquisitions of proved, unproved and other property and development expenditures. Our capital expenditures including acquisitions were 273.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In order to mitigate volatility in oil and natural gas prices, we have entered into commodity derivative contracts. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk. 
 We incurred costs of approximately 15.7 million for drilling, completion and recompletion activities and facilities costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we have budgeted approximately 20.0 million for such costs in 2024. 
 The amount and timing of these capital expenditures is substantially within our control and subject to management s discretion. We retain the flexibility to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to the prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, seasonal conditions and drilling and acquisition costs. Any postponement or elimination of our development program could result in a reduction of proved reserve volumes, production and cash flow, including distributions to unitholders. 
 Based on current commodity prices and our drilling success rate to date, we expect to be able to fund our distributions, meet our debt obligations and fund our 2024 capital development program and acquisitions from cash flow from operations, the Offering and borrowings under our Credit Facility. 
 If cash flow from operations does not meet our expectations, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures and/or distributions to unitholders. Alternatively, we may fund these expenditures using borrowings under our Credit Facility, issuances of debt and equity securities or from other sources, such as asset sales. We cannot assure you that necessary capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness could be limited by covenants in our debt arrangements. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us, finance the capital expenditures necessary to maintain our production or proved reserves, or make distributions to unitholders.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in net cash paid on our derivatives, partially offset by a decline in operating results, excluding the effects of derivatives, primarily due to lower production and lower natural gas, NGL and oil realizations partially offset by decreased costs. 
 Net cash used by investing activities 
 Net cash used by investing activities increased 232.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in proved property acquisitions of 252.2 million partially offset by decreased development costs of 19.7 million.

 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 226.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in net borrowings under our Credit Facility of 222.0 million and increased net proceeds from public offering of 35.0 million partially offset by increased distributions to unitholders of 27.9 million and increased debt offering costs of 3.0 million. 
 Revolving credit agreement 
 On August 30, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 4 and Borrowing Base Agreement Amendment No. 4 on our senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility with certain commercial banks, as the lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent. We use the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. Amendment No. 4 extended the maturity date of the Credit Facility to August 30, 2028, increased the borrowing base from 165 million to 275 million and joined certain new Lenders to the Credit Facility. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Our Credit Facility contains certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on incurring debt and liens, limitations on merging or consolidating with another company, limitations on making certain restricted payments, limitations on investments, limitations on paying distributions on, redeeming, or repurchasing common units, limitations on entering into transactions with affiliates, and limitations on asset sales. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. 
 At our election, interest on borrowings under the credit facility is determined by reference to either the secured overnight financing rate plus an applicable margin between 3.00 and 4.00 per annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowings under the Credit Facility) or the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin between 2.00 and 3.00 per annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowings under the Credit Facility). The weighted average interest rate on Credit Facility borrowings was 8.80 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We are required to maintain (i) a current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) greater than 1.0 to 1.0 , which for purposes of this definition includes availability under the Credit Facility but excludes the fair value of derivative instruments, and (ii) a ratio of total net debt-to-EBITDAX of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0 . For purposes of the total net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio, total net debt is total debt for borrowed money (including capital leases and purchase money debt) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand at such time (not exceeding 15.0 million in the aggregate), minus the unpaid balance of the FAM Loan. EBITDAX means the sum of (i) net income plus interest expense; income taxes paid; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expenses, including workover expenses; non-cash charges including unrealized losses on derivative instruments; and, any extraordinary or non-recurring charges, minus (ii) any extraordinary or non-recurring income and any non-cash income including unrealized gains on derivative instruments. 
 We had 148 million of debt outstanding and 127 million available under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Contractual obligations and commitments 
 We have not guaranteed the debt or obligations of any other party, nor do we have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in consolidated debt or losses. 
 Derivative contracts 
 We have entered into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. If market prices are higher than the contract prices when the cash settlement amount is calculated, we are required to pay the contract counterparties. As of September 30, 2024 , the current liability related to such contracts was 1.3 million. Such payments will generally be funded by higher prices received from the sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas. For further information on derivative contracts, see Note 10 in the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Asset Retirement Obligation 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had asset retirement obligations of 179.8 million inclusive of a current portion of 1.8 million. For further information on asset retirement obligations, see Note 7 in the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 There has been no change in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk, including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as described below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 other than speculative trading. Also, gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by losses and gains on the offsetting expenses. 
 Commodity price risk 
 Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing that we receive for our oil, NGL and natural gas production. Pricing for oil, NGLs, and natural gas has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and this volatility is expected to continue in the future. The prices we receive for our oil, NGL, and natural gas production depend on many factors outside of our control, such as the strength of the global economy and global supply and demand for the commodities we produce. 
 To reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices on our revenues, we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts with respect to certain of our oil, NGL and natural gas production through various transactions that limit the risks of fluctuations of future prices. We plan to continue our practice of entering into such transactions to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Future transactions may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty. Additionally, we may enter into collars, whereby we receive the excess, if any, of the fixed floor over the floating rate or pay the excess, if any, of the floating rate over the fixed ceiling. These hedging activities are intended to limit our exposure to product price volatility and to maintain stable cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the fair market value of our oil, NGL and natural gas derivative contracts was a net liability of 1.5 million. Based upon our open commodity derivative positions at September 30, 2024 , a hypothetical 10 change in the NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub prices, OPIS prices and basis prices would change our net oil, NGL and natural gas derivative liability by approximately 21.4 million. 
 (in thousands) Fair Value at 
 September 30, 2024 
 Hypothetical Price Increase or Decrease of 10 Derivative asset (liability) Crude Oil 
 5,694 (9,721) Derivative asset (liability) Natural Gas Liquids 
 Derivative asset (liability) Natural Gas 
 (7,234) (11,643) Net derivative liability 
 (1,540) (21,364) 
 The hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease. 
 Counterparty and customer credit risk 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We manage and control this risk by investing these funds in major financial institutions. We often have balances in excess of the federally insured limits. 
 We sell oil, NGL and natural gas production to various types of customers. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and historical payment record. The future availability of a ready market for our production depends on numerous factors outside of our control, none of which can be predicted with certainty. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , we had two customers, that each accounted for more than 10 of total revenues. We do not believe the loss of any single purchaser would materially impact our operating results because oil, NGLs and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had commodity derivative contracts with counterparties. We are currently not required to provide collateral or other security to counterparties to support derivative instruments; however, to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments, it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, we use master netting arrangements to minimize credit risk exposure. The creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review.

 Interest rate risk 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had 148 million of variable rate debt outstanding. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding, the impact on interest expense of a 1 increase or decrease in the average interest rate would be approximately 1.5 million per year . See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Revolving credit agreement. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are party to lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict the outcome of any such lawsuits with certainty, but management believes it is remote that pending or threatened legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in other routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities, including workers compensation claims and employment-related disputes. In the opinion of our management, none of these other pending litigation matters, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Other than the risks set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risks Related to the Williston Acquisitions 
 
 We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the EMEP Acquisition and our assessment and estimates of the Williston Assets may prove to be incorrect. 
 
 We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the EMEP Acquisition. There can be no assurance that the EMEP Acquisition will be beneficial to us. We may not be able to integrate the Williston Assets without increases in costs or other difficulties. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with the integration of the EMEP Acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the market price of our common units. 
 
 Our assessment and estimates of the properties in the EMEP Acquisition to date has been limited and may prove to be incorrect. Our assessment of these properties may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, any inspection that we do may not reveal all title issues or other problems. We may be required to assume the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. Our ability to make specified claims against the seller generally expires over time and we may be left with no recourse for liabilities and other problems associated with the Williston Acquisitions that we do not discover prior to the expiration date related to such matters arising under the Williston Acquisitions. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the EMEP 2024 development program will increase production or enable us to achieve a three-year average annual decline rate on the Williston Assets of approximately 14 . 
 
 The market price of our common units may decline as a result of the Williston Acquisitions if, among other things, the integration of the properties acquired in the Williston Acquisitions is unsuccessful or if the properties are not successfully developed by working interest owners or if the liabilities, expenses, title and other defects, or transaction costs related to the Williston Acquisitions is greater than expected. The market price of our common units may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Williston Acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by us or by securities market participants or if the effect of the Williston Acquisitions on our business, results of operations or financial condition or prospects is not consistent with our expectations or those of securities market participants. 
 
 As a result of the completion of the EMEP Acquisition, we are required to prepare and disclose historical and pro forma financial statements with the SEC, which such financial statements have not been prepared or filed as of the date of this report . 
 
 As a result of the completion of the EMEP Acquisition, we are required to file audited financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and pro forma financial statements in connection with the Williston Acquisitions no later than 75 calendar days after the date on which the EMEP Acquisition closes. You will not have the benefit of the financial statements or pro forma information relating to the Williston Acquisitions until such financial statements are filed, and the pro forma financial statements of the Company, pro forma for the Williston Acquisitions, may differ significantly from the historical financial statements of the Company.

 Any acquisitions we complete, including the Williston Acquisitions, are subject to substantial risks that could reduce our ability to make distributions to our common unitholders. 
 
 Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders, these acquisitions, including the Williston Acquisitions, may nevertheless result in a decrease in the amount of cash available for distribution. Any acquisition, including the Williston Acquisitions, involves potential risks, including, among other things: 
 
 the validity of our assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, drilling locations, prices, revenues, capital expenditures and production costs; 
 
 the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate; 
 
 our inability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire; and 
 
 the occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges. 
 
 We incurred significant indebtedness to finance the EMEP Acquisition . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have 148.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. This resulted in an increase to our net-debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAX ratio to approximately one times. 
 
 This indebtedness will increase our borrowing costs and may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Furthermore, our borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate, and such indebtedness will expose us to interest rate risk, as our debt service obligations could increase if interest rates increase. As a result, this indebtedness will require that an increased portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on such indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 
 
 The Williston Acquisitions may have liabilities that are not known to us, and the indemnities in the applicable Purchase Agreement may not offer adequate protection. 
 
 In connection with the Williston Acquisitions, we have agreed to assume certain liabilities. In addition, there may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into the Williston Acquisitions, or we may not have correctly assessed the significance of certain liabilities identified in the course of our due diligence. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may learn additional information as we integrate the entities and their businesses into our operations, such as unknown or contingent liabilities or issues relating to compliance with applicable laws, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
