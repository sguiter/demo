as of September
30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue
as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, to identify new business opportunities and raise additional capital resources.
The Company is significantly dependent upon its ability and will continue to attempt to secure additional equity and/or debt financing.
There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing, it would be unlikely for the Company to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue
in existence. Such adjustments could be material.

ITEM
 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
interim financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition to historical financial information,
the following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and our current views with respect
to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate,
anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue
certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Except as required by applicable law,
including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these
statements to actual results. 

New
Business 

The
Company has no active business at the present time. We are actively seeking business opportunities to engage in. 

Funding 

All
of our ongoing operations have continued to be funded by monies advanced to us by LSG, our largest shareholder. We do not currently have
enough funds to carry out our entire plan of operations, so we intend to meet the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months
through a combination of debt financing and equity financing through private placements. There is no assurance that we will be successful
in completing any such financings. 

If
we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising efforts, we may review other financing options, although
we cannot provide any assurance that any such options will be available to us or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. Further, if we
are unable to secure any additional financing then we plan to reduce the amount that we spend on our operations, including our management-related
consulting fees and other general expenses, so as not to exceed the capital resources available to us. Regardless, our current cash reserves
and working capital will not be sufficient for us to sustain our business for the next 12 months, even if we decide to scale back our
operations.

ITEM
 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Intellectual
Property 

We
do not have any intellectual property. 

Personnel 

We
have no employees. Our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Director and Secretary Mark Walmesley,
receives no compensation for his services. We expect to continue to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary. 

Going
Concern 

There
is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay
our expenses. This is because we have not generated any revenues to-date and we cannot currently estimate the timing of any possible
future revenues. Our only source of cash at this time is from loans or investments by others in our common stock. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements for the
period ended September 30, 2024 which are included above in Part I, Item 1.

ITEM
 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

The
decrease in expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to a decrease in office expenses from foreign exchange calculation,
lower professional expenses for accounting and filing fees offset by an increase in corporate support and services. 

Balance
Sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 

Items
with notable period-end differences are as follows:

 (9,171 
 -62 
 
 Due to related parties and accrued interest 
 122,059 
 77,235 
 44,824 
 58 

The
decrease in accrued liabilities is due to the audit fees accrual for 2023 at December 31, 2023. The increase in due to related party
is due to the additional funding provided by Company s majority shareholder to cover operating expenses. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, our total assets were 3,575 and our total liabilities were 127,577. Our working capital deficiency at September
30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and the changes between those dates were as follows:

 (124,002 
 (89,450 
 (34,552 
 39 

The
increase in our working capital deficiency from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was due to cash outflow from operating activities
which were funded by loans from related parties.

We
have yet to generate any revenues from our business operation and our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs
is entirely dependent on the issuance of shares or loans, which have been our principal sources of working capital so far. For the foreseeable
future, we will have to continue to rely on those sources for funding. We have no assurance that we can successfully engage in any further
private sales of our securities or that we can obtain any additional loans.

ITEM
 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

ITEM
 4. 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures
of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the size and nature
of the existing business operation. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement disclosure
control procedures is limited. Until the organization can increase sufficiently in size to warrant an increase in personnel required
to effectively execute and monitor formal disclosure control procedures, those formal procedures will not be implemented. Given the current
size of the organization, there are not significant levels of supervision, review, independent directors or a formal audit committee. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
 1A. 
 RISK
 FACTORS 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide information
under this item. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including, without limitation,
the items listed in Item 1A RISK FACTORS in our report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM
 1 C. 
 CYBERSECURITY 

At
present the Company has minimal risk related to Cybersecurity as no operational business is conducted on the internet or available through
the internet. 

Cybersecurity
risk management will be an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management efforts once the Company has determined how and
what security measures will need to be deployed. No enterprise risk can be eliminated entirely. We will seek to mitigate as much risk
as possible and manage the remaining financial risk through a cyber insurance policy. The Company has chosen the National Institute of
Standards (NIST) for its base framework because it is compatible with certain risk management business functions required by customers
and US Government oversight. Controls in the SP 800-53 catalog will be tailored-in based on governance found in SP 800-171, internally
determined IT General Controls, and industry best practices to create a balanced approach protecting confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. 

Governance 

Our
Board of Directors has primary responsibility for evaluating cybersecurity risk management, overseeing our major cybersecurity risk exposures
and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including policies and procedures for assessing and managing
risk, as well as oversight of compliance related to legal and regulatory exposure. 

The
 to be newly formed management positions responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks will be a Director of
Cybersecurity and a Chief Information Officer CIO ), who will report directly to our CFO. Presently our CFO is undertaking
the actions of both the Director of Cybersecurity and CIO. The CIO will be responsible for ensuring that we have a cybersecurity risk
management program in place that is fully aligned with business requirements and strategy. 

ITEM
 2. 
 UNREGISTERED
 SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

We
had no unregistered sales of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Other
than as disclosed above and in previous reports filed with the SEC, we have not issued any equity securities that were not registered
under the Securities Act within the past three years.
