units Units at per Unit generating gross proceeds
of , which is discussed in Note 3. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of units Private Placement Units at a price of
 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian private limited company, a related
party generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. 

Additionally
with the closing of the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to Units to cover over-allotment.
On December 13, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the option and purchased additional Units (the Over-allotment
Units ), generating additional gross proceeds of . 

Simultaneously
with the exercise of the over-allotment, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional Private Placement Units to Public
Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd. at a price of per Private Placement Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of . Since the
underwriters over-allotment was exercised in full, the sponsor did not forfeit any Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5). 

Offering
costs for the IPO and the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option amounted to , consisting of 
of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account (defined below)) and 
of other costs. As described in Note 6, the of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent upon the consummation of a
Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Following
the closing of the IPO, per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement
Units were placed in a trust account Trust Account and were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning
set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting
the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act. 

To
mitigate the risk of being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), in July 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company,
the trustee of the Trust Account (the Trustee or Continental ), to liquidate the U.S. government securities
or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (which may include demand
deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of our Business Combination or liquidation. Furthermore, such cash is held in bank
accounts, which exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale
of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. 

The
Company will provide the holders (the Public Stockholders of the outstanding shares of common stock included in the Units,
or the Public Shares with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination
either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The
decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by
the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the
Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes
payable). There will be no redemption rights with respect to the Company s warrants. 

All
of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature, which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s
liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s Business Combination and in connection
with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended and restated and may be
further amended and restated from time to time, the Certificate of Incorporation ). In accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely
within the control of a company require the Public Shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that
the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants and rights), the initial carrying value of
common stock classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The Public Shares
are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either
(i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that
the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption
value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting
period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. While redemptions cannot cause the Company s net tangible
assets to fall below , the Public Shares are redeemable and are classified as such on the consolidated balance sheets until
such date that a redemption event takes place. 

Redemptions
of the Company s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to
an agreement relating to the Company s Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination,
or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange
listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant
to its Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder
approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder
approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to
the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination,
the sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor
of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and
if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or
any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of or more of the shares of common stock sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
Company originally had until March 9, 2023, 15 months from the closing of the IPO to complete a Business Combination. On March 6, 2023,
the Company held a special meeting (the March 2023 Special Meeting ), during which the stockholders of the Company approved
a proposal to amend the Company s amended and restated certified articles of incorporation which included extending the time in
which the Company must complete a Business Combination (the Extension Amendment Proposal and a proposal to amend the Company s
investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 6, 2021 (the Trust Agreement ), by and between the Company and
Continental (the Trust Amendment Proposal ). The Company had the option of two (2) three-months extensions, followed by
three (3) one-month extensions, or until December 9, 2023, if all extensions are exercised. The Company exercised the option for two
three-month extensions and as a result the Company has deposited a total of , or for each three-month extension, into
the Trust Account and had until September 9, 2023 to complete its Business Combination, which was funded by a promissory note with Public
Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd. which has a current balance of . On September 9, 2023, October 4, 2023, and October 31, 2023, the
Company deposited each time into the Trust Account, representing per public share, which further extended the period
of time it has to consummate its initial business combination to December 9, 2023 Combination Period ). The September 9,
2023, October 9, 2023 and November 1, 2023 payments were funded by the advance of provided by an affiliate of GL Sponsor, LLC,
the Company s sponsor (the sponsor ). 

On
March 6, 2023, in connection with the approval of the proposals presented at the March 2023 Special Meeting which extended the time in
which the Company must complete a Business Combination, holders of of the Company s shares of common stock exercised
their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of per share, for an aggregate of approximately million. 

On
October 16, 2023, the Company received a written notice (the Notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department
of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2),
which requires the Company to maintain at least 400 total holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Minimum
Total Holders Rule ). The Notice is only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on
the listing or trading of the Company s securities on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Notice stated that the Company had 45 calendar
days, or until November 30, 2023, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Rule. On January 29, 2024, the
Company submitted an application to phase-down from The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market. On March 6, 2024, the Company
received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff granting the Company s request for transfer to The Nasdaq Capital
Market. The Company s securities were transferred to The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on March 12, 2024. In
connection with the approval of the phase-down application, the staff indicated that the Company s deficiency with the Minimum
Total Holders Rule was cured and the matter was closed. 

On
November 28, 2023, 

On
November 28, 2023, the stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, allowing
the Company to the Extended Deadline from December 9, 2023 to up to December 9, 2024 through monthly Extensions. To obtain each Extension,
the Company, its sponsor or any of their affiliates or designees must deposit into the Company s trust account with Continental
by the deadline applicable prior to such Extension, for each Extension. On November 28, 2023, the stockholders of the Company
also approved a proposal to amend the Company s Trust Agreement (as defined above), by and between the Company and Continental.
In connection with the approval of the proposals presented at the special meeting held on November 28, 2023, holders of shares
of the Company s common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of per share,
for an aggregate of approximately million. 

On
April 3, 2024, Globalink Merger Sub (Cayman), was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Globalink. 

As
of the date of this report, the Company has extended the Termination Date twelve times under its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended
(or seventeen times since the IPO), and has until December 9, 2024 to complete its initial business combination. 

On
October 3, 2024, the Company deposited an aggregate of into the trust account of the Company for its public stockholders, which
enables the Company to further extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination by one month from October
9, 2024 to November 9, 2024. This extension is the sixteenth extension since the consummation of the Company s initial public offering
on December 9, 2021, and the eleventh of up to twelve extensions permitted under the Certificate of Incorporation currently in effect. 

On
November 7, 2024, the Company deposited an aggregate of into the trust account of the Company for its public stockholders, which
enables the Company to further extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial business combination by one month from November
9, 2024 to December 9, 2024. This extension is the twelfth extension since the consummation of the Company s initial public
offering on December 9, 2021, and the final of up to twelve extensions permitted under the Certificate of Incorporation currently in
effect. 

The
Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete
a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Stockholders should acquire any Public Shares in or after
the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company
fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to deferred
underwriting discounts (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be
available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of
the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only per share held in the Trust
Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the
extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the
Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not
apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the
event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the sponsor will not be responsible to the extent
of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the sponsor will have to indemnify
the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Risks
and Uncertainties 

The
Company continues to evaluate the impact of increases in inflation and rising interest rates, financial market instability, including
the recent bank failures, the potential government shutdown, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain geopolitical
events, including the wars in Ukraine and the surrounding region and between Israel and Hamas. The Company has concluded that while it
is reasonably possible that the risks and uncertainties related to or resulting from these events could have a negative effect on its
financial position, results of operations and/or ability to complete an initial Business Combination, the Company cannot at this time
fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively
impact the Company s business and its ability to complete an initial Business Combination. 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and
certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed
on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally
 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise
tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value
of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the
Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the
abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. 

Any
redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise,
may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business
Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions
and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii)
the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued
not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content
of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the
redeeming holder. The foregoing could cause a reduction
in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 

During
the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the Excise
Tax. These regulations provided that the filing and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023
to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024. 

The
Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to this obligation. . 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had of cash available to meet working capital needs and a working capital deficit of approximately
 million. 

Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The Company will need to raise
additional capital through loans or additional investments from its sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The
Company s officers, directors and the sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any
time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly,
the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. 

If
the Business Combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments
from its sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and its sponsor may, but
are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole
discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing.
If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could
include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead
expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at
all. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company currently has until November 9, 2024
to consummate a business combination, or up to December 9, 2024 if the time to complete the initial business combination is extended
as described herein. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a business combination by this time. If a business combination
is not consummated by this date and an extension is not requested by the sponsor, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent
dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and an
extension is not requested by the sponsor, and potential subsequent dissolution as well as liquidity condition noted above raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets
or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after November 9, 2024 (or up to December 9, 2024 if the time to complete
the initial business combination is extended as described herein). The Company intends to complete a business combination before the
mandatory liquidation date. 

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the
statutory tax rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily due to changes in the fair value
in warrant liabilities, valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets, non-deductible M A costs and penalties and prior year true
up. 

FASB
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than
not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 or December
31, 2023. No amounts were paid for interest and penalties for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company is currently not
aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company
is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. 

Excise
Tax 

In
connection with the vote to approve the charter amendment proposal presented at the March 2023 Special Meeting, holders of 
shares of common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares of common stock for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately
 million. In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal at the Special Meeting
on November 28, 2023, holders of shares of the Company s common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for
cash at an approximate price of per share, for an aggregate of approximately million. Immediately following the payment
of the redemptions, the Trust Account had a balance of approximately million before the Extension Payment. As such, the Company
has recorded a Excise Tax liability in the amount of on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September
30, 2024. The liability does not impact the consolidated statements of operations and is offset against additional paid-in capital or
accumulated deficit if additional paid-in capital is not available. 

During the second quarter of 2024, the Internal Revenue
Service issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the Excise Tax. These regulations provided that the filing
and payment deadline for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 would be October 31, 2024. 

The Company is currently
evaluating its options with respect to this obligation. . 

Franchise
Tax 

The
Company calculates Franchise Tax liability on a quarterly basis using the estimate calculator on the Delaware Franchise Tax website.
At December 31, 2023, the Company had over accrued the amount due by approximately and made an adjustment in the period ended
September 30, 2024 to true up the amount due. 

shares of common stock subject to possible redemption were presented

shares of common stock of the Company at per share were
issued on December 9, 2021. For the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants had been
exercised. The potential shares of common stock underlying the outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants to
purchase the Company s shares of common stock were excluded from diluted earnings per share for the periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 because they are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. Additionally, the rights are able
to be demanded on or any time after the Business Combination, and as the contingency has not been met, the rights are excluded from diluted
earnings per share for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As a result, diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock
is the same as basic net income (loss) per share of common stock for the periods. The table below presents a reconciliation of the numerator

Capital Loans ). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company will repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds
of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the

shares of common stock with a par value of per share. As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, there were (excluding shares of common stock subject to possible redemption) shares of common
stock issued and outstanding. 

Warrants: 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants outstanding. 

The
Public Warrants are accounted for as equity instruments in the Company s consolidated financial statements. Public Warrants may
only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public
Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the
completion of an initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption. No Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the
Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public
Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement
covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within a specified period following
the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and
during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that
exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public
Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

Redemption
of warrants when the price per common stock equals or exceeds 

Once
the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private
placement warrants): 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of per warrant; 

upon
 a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, which the Company refers to as the 30-day redemption period 
 and 

if,
 and only if, the last reported sale price (the closing price of the Company s common stock equals or exceeds
 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant
 as described under the heading Description of Securities Warrants for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading
 day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

The
Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering
the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common
stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may
exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable
state securities laws. 

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. 

The
Private Placement Warrants are substantially in the same form as the Public Warrants, except they (i) will be exercisable either for
cash or on a cashless basis at the holder s option pursuant and (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in either case as long
as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees (as prescribed in the Subscription
Agreement, dated December 6, 2021, by and between the Company and Public Gold Marketing Sdn. Bhd.). Once a Private Placement Warrant
is transferred to a holder other than a permitted transferee, it shall be treated as a Public Warrant for all purposes. Due to these
terms the Private Warrants are required to be liability classified. 

The
exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including
in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants
will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of common stock at a price below their respective exercise prices. Additionally, in no event
will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of the warrants will not receive any of such
funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust
Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 

In
addition, if the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share of common stock (with
such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors, and in the case of
any such issuance to the initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by them prior
to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest
thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions),
and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the
trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below
 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of (i)
the Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the additional common stock or equity-linked securities. 

Rights 

Except
in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a Public Right will automatically receive
one-tenth of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of a Public Right converted all
shares held by him, her or it in connection with a Business Combination or an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation
with respect to its pre-business combination activities. In the event that the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion
of a Business Combination, each holder of a Public Right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to
receive the one-tenth of a share underlying each Public Right upon consummation of the Business Combination. 

The
Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of Public Rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down
to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
As a result, the holders of the Public Rights must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of the holders 
rights upon closing of a Business Combination.

Overview 

We
were formed on March 24, 2021 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target
business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses
in in North America, Europe, South East Asia, and Asia (excluding mainland China and the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions),
in the medical technology and green energy industry. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its
principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). We intend to complete the business acquisition in a combination
of cash (whether cash from the trust account or cash from a debt or equity financing transaction that closes concurrently with the business
combination) or our equity securities. 

The
issuance of additional shares of common stock in connection with an initial business combination: 

may
 significantly dilute the equity interest of our investors who would not have pre-emption rights in respect of any such issuance; 

may
 subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded
 to our shares of common stock; 

could
 cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things,
 our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
 and directors; 

may
 have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person
 seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may
 adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock, rights and/or warrants. 

19 

Similarly,
 if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in: 

default
 and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt
 obligations; 

acceleration
 of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
 that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our
 immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our
 inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such
 financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

using
 a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
 on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general
 corporate purposes; 

limitations
 on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased
 vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations
 on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution
 of our strategy; and 

other
 purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
a Business Combination will be successful.

of 40,200,000, in a private placement (the PIPE Investment ). 

The
purpose of the PIPE Investment is to raise additional capital for use by PubCo following the closing of the Business Combination (the
 Closing ). The PIPE Subscription Agreements contain customary representations and warranties of each of Globalink, Alps
Holdco, PubCo and the PIPE Investors, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Business Combination. Under
the terms of the PIPE Subscription Agreements, PubCo is obligated to file a registration statement to register for the resale of all

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

The
registration statement on Form S-1 for the Company s IPO was declared effective on December 6, 2021. On December 9, 2021, we consummated
our IPO of 10,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, 0.001 par value, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10)
of a share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder thereof
to purchase one-half (1/2) of a share of common stock at a price of 11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at an offering price
of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private
placement of 517,500 private units at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating total proceeds of 5,175,000. 

On
December 9, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 units in full (the Over-Allotment
Units ), and the closing of the Over-Allotment Units occurred on December 13, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company
of 1,500,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of 15,000,000. On December 13, 2021, simultaneously
with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the private sale of an additional 52,500 private units, generating gross proceeds
of 525,000. Since the underwriter s over-allotment was exercised in full, the Sponsor did not forfeit any insider shares. 

Offering
costs for the IPO and the exercise of the underwriters Over-allotment Option amounted to 6,887,896, consisting of 2,300,000
of underwriting fees, 4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in the Trust Account) and 562,896 of other costs.
The 4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent upon the consummation of an initial business combination by December 9, subject to the terms of the underwriting
agreement. 

Following
the closing of the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units), 116,725,000 10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the
units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Units), and the private units was placed in the Trust Account and was initially invested
in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
 Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself
out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the
Investment Company Act. 

To
mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test
of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), on July 27, 2023, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company,
as trustee of our Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter
to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash (which may include demand deposit accounts) until the earlier of consummation of our initial
business combination or liquidation. Furthermore, such cash is held in bank accounts, which exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1,757,620. Net loss of 709,239 was affected by interest
earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 1,036,806 and change in fair value of warrants liabilities of 12,369. Changes in operating
assets and liabilities used 23,944 of cash for operating activities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 1,174,478. Net income of 1,224,868 was affected by
interest earned on cash and investments held in the Trust Account of 2,550,909 and change in fair value of warrants liabilities of 4,446.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced 147,117 of cash from operating activities. 

21 

We
had cash held in the Trust Account of 29,811,256 and 28,668,218 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest
income on the balance in the Trust Account of 1,036,806 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 may be used by us to pay taxes.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 433,768 was withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay for taxes. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust
Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole
or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses or make other acquisitions. 

We
had 65,221 and 79,073 of cash held outside of the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We intend
to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete initial business combination. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or
certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If the
Company completes an initial business combination, the Company will repay the working capital loans out of the proceeds of the Trust
Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the working capital loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account.
In the event that our initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account
to repay the working capital loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the working capital loans. Except
for the foregoing, the terms of such working capital loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. The working capital loans would either be repaid upon consummation of an initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into units of the post initial
business combination entity at a price of 10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the private units. As of September 30, 2024,
there were no working capital loans outstanding.

If
our initial business combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments
from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are
not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion,
to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but
not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses.
The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 

22 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company currently has until December 9, 2024 to complete the initial business combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a business combination by this time. If a business combination
is not consummated by this date and an extension is not requested by the Sponsor, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent
dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and an
extension is not requested by the Sponsor, and potential subsequent dissolution as well as liquidity condition noted above raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets
or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after December 9, 2024. The Company intends to complete a business combination before the
mandatory liquidation date. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with entities or financial partnerships, often referred to
as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the insider shares, the private units and any units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans or extension
loans (and any securities underlying the private units or units issued upon conversion of the working capital loans or extension loans)
will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement requiring us to register such securities for resale.
The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities.
In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent
to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act. 

Underwriting
Agreement 

The
underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discounts of 0.35 per unit, or 4,025,000 from the closing of the IPO and the Over-Allotment
Units. The deferred discounts will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if the Company
completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Right
of First Refusal 

Subject
to certain conditions, we granted Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters in the IPO, for a period of 18
months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, a right of first refusal to act as book-running manager,
with at least 30 of the economics, for any and all future public and private equity and debt offerings. In accordance with FINRA Rule
5110(f)(2)(E)(i), such right of first refusal shall not have a duration of more than three years from the effective date of the registration
statement for the IPO. 

Promissory
Notes 

As
of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amounted owed in connection with the promissory notes was 3,736,066, which includes interest accrued
as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are
electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our consolidated
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required
of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement
that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of executive compensation
to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until
we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

Critical
Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial information. We describe
our significant accounting policies in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included
in this report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require
that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis,
management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented
fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and
information available from outside sources, as appropriate. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Accounting
for Warrants 

The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB, ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are
freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants
meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s
own shares of common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional
judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with our IPO in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 under which
the public warrants meet the criteria for equity treatment and the private warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and
must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies the private warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust
the private warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until
exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was
estimated using a binomial lattice model. 

In
determining the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants assumptions related to exercise price, market price of the public stock,
expected life and risk-free interest rate are utilized. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical
volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, due
to the material weakness identified in the controls related to the events that led to the Company s restatement of its financial
statements to reclassify the Company s private warrants (complex financial instruments), the Company s internal control over
financial reporting related to our compliance control of timely tax return filings, and due to the revisions to our earnings per share,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. We plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements
to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents
and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications.
The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately
have the intended effects.
