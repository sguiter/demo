reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock; and change the name of the Company to NovAccess Global Inc. After completing the acquisition of StemVax LLC in September 2020, we exited the solar business and focused all our efforts on our biopharmaceutical business. 

Line of Business 

 NovAccess Global Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing novel immunotherapies to treat brain tumor patients in the United States with plans to expand globally. We specialize in cutting-edge research related to utilizing a patient s own immune system to attack the cancer. We are filing an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain approval for human clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of our drug product for brain cancer patients. Once we have successfully completed the clinical trials and proven that the new therapy is safe and efficacious, we plan to commercialize the product. We also have expertise in successfully executing clinical trials, bringing products to market and increasing the market size of products through our advisory board. Our scientists are well versed in immunology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, molecular biology, imaging, small molecules development, gene therapy and other technical assays needed for protein and genetic analysis of cancer cells. 

NovAccess operates as a research and development (R D) company out of Ohio and California, and our executive management and scientific advisory board provide over 15 years of extensive experience in all aspects of biopharmaceutical R D and commercialization of drug candidates. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company does not generate significant revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusions. The Company has obtained funds from its shareholders and from lenders since its inception through the period ended June 30, 2024. Management believes the existing shareholders, prospective new investors and lenders will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company s obligations as they become due and will allow the development of its business.

Evaluation of Financing Transactions 

We evaluated the financing transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the conversion feature of the convertible promissory notes was not afforded the exemption for conventional convertible instruments due to thier variable conversion rates. The notes have no explicit limit on the number of shares issuable so they did not meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. The Company elected to recognize the notes under paragraph 815-15-25-4, whereby, there would be a separation into a host contract and derivative instrument. The Company elected to initially and subsequently measure the notes in their entirety at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Company recorded a derivative liability representing the imputed interest associated with the embedded derivative. The derivative liability is adjusted periodically according to the stock price fluctuations based upon the Binomial lattice model calculation.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Cautionary and Forward-Looking Statements 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in this Quarterly Report and under Item 1A: Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report. Readers should carefully review the factors described in other documents that the Company files from time to time with the SEC. 

Organization 

NovAccess Global Inc. is a Colorado corporation that was formerly known as XsunX, Inc. and Sun River Mining Inc. 

Business Plan 

In 2020, we transitioned our operations from solar contracting operations to the commercialization of developmental healthcare solutions in the biotechnology, medical, and health and wellness markets. On June 2, 2020, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Innovest Global, Inc. to acquire StemVax, LLC StemVax for 7.5 million shares of our unregistered common stock. The acquisition was completed on September 8, 2020. 

StemVax is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for brain tumor patients that holds an exclusive patent license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California (Cedars-Sinai) known as StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB/TLR-AD1). TLR-AD1 specifically targets glioblastoma, the most common and lethal type of adult brain tumor. Christopher Wheeler, President of StemVax, has been involved in the pre-clinical research and development of the drug candidate at Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurosurgery since 1997. Dr. Wheeler began preparing the pre-IND application to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval to start human clinical trials. In 2021, Dr. Wheeler led pre-IND interactions with the FDA and obtained a recommended roadmap from the FDA to facilitate the filing of an IND application for a Phase I application or a Phase IIa application. We currently plan to submit an IND application in 2024 if funding is available. In August 2022, we filed an application with the FDA for orphan drug designation ODD for TLR-AD1, which was granted in October 2022. Receiving ODD status represents a milestone in the development of TLR-AD1 and provides us with multiple incentives, including seven-year marketing exclusivity and federal tax credits, among other benefits. 

We believe that investing in the biotechnology industry will significantly increase value for our shareholders. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this endeavor or that we can obtain the funding necessary to commercialize StemVax Glioblast or locate, acquire and finance the acquisition of additional biotechnology companies. 

Recent Events 

On April 22, 2024, we procured a new intellectual property license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to further advance the Company s immunotherapy platform. The license pertains to the use of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), a protein previously known to impact cell metabolism, to predict responsiveness to vaccine immunotherapy in treating highly malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). IDH1 is commonly mutated in brain and other tumors, but research published by the president of StemVax shows that it surprisingly predicts antitumor responses after vaccine therapy through a unique molecular mechanism. Because of this, IDH1 expression discerns long from short survivors after vaccine therapy in patients with brain tumors such as GBM.

Results of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to three months ended June 30, 2023 

Revenue and Cost of Sales 

The Company generated no revenue or cost of goods sold in the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses decreased by 166,433 during the three months ended June 30, 2024, to 278,048 as compared to 444,481 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2024, was related primarily to lower expense on warrants issued in connection with loans which accounted for 173,424 of the reduction. All other selling general and administrative expenses netted to an increase of 6,991. 

Research and development expenses 

The research and development expense marginally decreased by 2,863 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, to 37,301 as compared to 40,164 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of lower expenses for consulting services. 

Other Income/(Expenses) 

Other expenses increased by 325,990 from other expense of 294,994 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, to other expense of 620,984 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The change in derivative liability was a loss of 445,500 compared to a gain of 78,871 in the prior year s three months. This increase in loss of 524,421 was partially offset by lower interest expense of 109,344 resulting from less discount amortization and a reduction in the expense for the commitment fee guarantee of 129,790 since there was little change in the stock price during the 2024 quarter. The estimates of fair market value are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price, volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on managements estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. 

Net Income/(Loss) 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, our net loss increased by 156,694, to 936,333 as compared to a net loss of 779,639 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as a result of the changes discussed above. 

Results of Operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023 

Revenue and Cost of Sales 

The Company generated no revenue or cost of goods sold in the in the nine months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses decreased by 1,258,410 during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, to 682,177 as compared to 1,940,587 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, was related primarily to a reduction in stock-based compensation of 563,314 for options granted in the prior year, a reduction in warrants issued for a value of 386,912 in the prior year period compared to 93,988 in the current period, a reduction in investor relations expenses of 250,872, and a reduction in the commitment fee expense for shares issued in connection with new loans of 68,750.

Research and development Expenses 

The research and development expense increased by 7,109 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, to 123,273 as compared to 116,164 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023. 5,000 of the increase relates to a new license fee. 

Other Income/(Expenses) 

Other income increased by 1,508,646 from other expense of 900,530 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023, to other income of 680,116 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to the Company recording an increase in gain on change in derivative liability of 1,326,206 and a reduction in interest expense of 493,728 due to lower debt amortization cost. These gains were partially offset by an increase in the commitment fee guarantee of 198,585. The estimates of fair market value are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price, volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on managements estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. 

Net Income/(Loss) 

For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our net loss decreased by 2,876,188, to 125,334 as compared to a net loss of 3,001,522 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of the changes discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had a working capital deficit at June 30, 2024, of 7,647,154 as compared to a working capital deficit of 7,798,484, as of September 30, 2023. The decrease of 151,330 in the working capital deficit was the result of a decrease in the derivative liability amounting to 1,080,647 offset by increases of 224,050 in accounts payable and 800,003 in accrued expenses and other liabilities. 

For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our cash flow used by operating activities was 159,975 as compared to cash flow used by operating activities of 469,786 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in cash flow used by operating activities was due to reduced payments as a result of the difficulties in obtaining funding. 

Cash flow used by investing activities was 0 during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023. 

Cash flow provided by financing activities was 139,354 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 467,000 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities reflects the difficulty in raising funds due to the delays in the proposed Sumner financing. 

The Company will need to raise additional funds to finance its ongoing operations, complete its IND application to the FDA and to make payments under its loan agreements. We expect this will require at least 3.0 million through December 31, 2025. We plan to raise this capital through the issuance of additional common stock as well as obtaining additional debt as needed. On December 29, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Sumner Global LLC, an affiliate of Sumner Investment Group Inc. Sumner ), pursuant to which Sumner agreed to purchase 33.0 million newly issued shares of our unregistered common stock for 0.11 a share, or 3.63 million in total, and to loan us 7.05 million. The transaction is subject to a number of contingencies, including Sumner completing its planned capital raise and there having been no material adverse effect on our business, operations, assets, financial condition or prospects. As a result, we cannot guarantee that the transaction will be completed when we expect, or whether the transaction will close at all. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these consolidated financial statements include the estimate of useful lives of property and equipment, the deferred tax valuation allowance, the fair value of stock options, and derivative liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Because NovAccess is a smaller reporting company as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are not required to provide additional market risk disclosure. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management team, with the participation of our chief executive officer and acting CFO, Dwain K. Irvin evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of NovAccess disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, Dr. Irvin concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our senior management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, defined under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board, senior management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 

There was a change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act that occurred during our third fiscal quarter as we established enhanced review procedures to eliminate adjustments to our financial statements identified by our independent auditors.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we issued 208,752 unregistered shares of our common stock for accounting and investor relations services. 108,750 of these shares were issued to a related party. The issuances of shares to our service providers were exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

Although we have negotiated extensions for the payment dates of many of our loans, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and subsequent to quarter-end, the Company failed to make payments when required and to otherwise comply with the covenants of several of the company s debts. For example, we are filing this Quarterly Report after its due date, which is a breach under several of our loan agreements. Although we are pursuing financing that would allow us to pay our debts when due, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary financing in a timely manner, or at all. For additional information concerning defaults under our loan agreements and extension of the due dates for our loans, please see Notes 5, Convertible Promissory Notes, and 13, Subsequent Events, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included with this Quarterly Report.
