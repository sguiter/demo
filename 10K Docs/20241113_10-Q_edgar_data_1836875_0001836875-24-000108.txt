Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our financial condition, our products, our business strategy, our beliefs and our management s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words like anticipates, estimates, projects, expects, plans, believes, intends, will, could, may, assumes and other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on management s beliefs, assumptions, estimates and observations of future events based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made and include any statements that do not relate to any historical or current fact. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements due in part to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC. 
 
 Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, (i) risks related to the rollout of Nuvve's business and the timing of expected business milestones; (ii) Nuvve's dependence on widespread acceptance and adoption of electric vehicles and increased installation of charging stations; (iii) Nuvve's ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, including the remediation of identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting relating to segregation of duties with respect to, and access controls to, its financial record keeping system, and Nuvve's accounting staffing levels; (iv) Nuvve's current dependence on sales of charging stations for most of its revenues; (v) overall demand for electric vehicle charging and the potential for reduced demand if governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives are reduced, modified or eliminated or governmental mandates to increase the use of electric vehicles or decrease the use of vehicles powered by fossil fuels, either directly or indirectly through mandated limits on carbon emissions, are reduced, modified or eliminated; (vi) potential adverse effects on Nuvve's backlog, revenue and gross margins if customers increasingly claim clean energy credits and, as a result, they are no longer available to be claimed by Nuvve; (vii) the effects of competition on Nuvve's future business; (viii) risks related to Nuvve's dependence on its intellectual property and the risk that Nuvve's technology could have undetected defects or errors; (ix) the risk that we conduct a portion of our operations through a joint venture exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control; (x) that our joint venture with Levo Mobility LLC may fail to generate the expected financial results, and the return may be insufficient to justify our investment of effort and/or funds; (xi) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (xii) the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect directly on Nuvve and the economy generally; (xiii) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to our joint ventures; (xiv) risks relating to privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the loss of data; (xv) the possibility that Nuvve may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (xvi) risks related to the benefits expected from the 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R. 3684), as well as other risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the SEC. 
 
 Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any other public statement made by us, including by our management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise, except as required under federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Nuvve Norway, a company registered in Norway is a branch of Nuvve Denmark. Nuvve CPO Inc., or Nuvve Charge Point Operator, was established in August 2024 to support the deployment and ongoing support of the Company's customers charging station networks. 
 On August 4, 2021, the Company formed Levo Mobility LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Levo"), with Stonepeak Rocket Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Stonepeak"), and Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Evolve").

 Levo 
 Levo is a sustainable infrastructure company focused on rapidly advancing the electrification of transportation by funding vehicle-to-grid ("V2G") enabled Electric Vehicle ("EV") fleet deployments. Levo utilizes Nuvve s V2G technology and conditional capital contribution commitments from Stonepeak and Evolve to offer Fleet-as-a-Service ("FaaS") for school buses, last-mile delivery, ride hailing and ride sharing, municipal services, and more to eliminate the primary barriers to EV fleet adoption including large upfront capital investments and lack of expertise in securing and managing EVs and associated charging infrastructure. 
 
 Levo's turnkey solution simplifies and streamlines electrification, can lower the total cost of EV operation for fleet owners, and supports the grid when the EVs are not in use. For a fixed monthly payment with no upfront cost, Levo will provide the EVs,

 membership interest in Levo to the Company for a de minimis price.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company incurred operating losses of approximately million as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company's cash used in operations were million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance, working capital, and total equity of million, million and million, respectively. The Company continues to expect to generate operating losses and negative cash flows and will need additional funding to support its planned operating activities through profitability. The transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful expanded commercialization of the Company's GIVe platform and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure. 
 Management plans to fund current operations through increased revenues and raising additional capital. Management's expectations with respect to the Company s ability to fund current planned operations is based on estimates that are subject to risks and uncertainties. There is an inherent risk that the Company may not achieve such financial projections and if so, cash outflows could be higher than currently anticipated. However, as such, plans are not solely within management s control, management cannot conclude as of the date of this filing that the plans are probable of being successfully implemented and as such has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the date of issuance of our financial statements. 
 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The resulting lower forecast of capital deployments reduced the probabilities of the future vesting of the unvested warrants. Therefore, at September 30, 2024, the Company has determined that it is unlikely that the unvested warrants will vest. 
 
 The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs and valuation methodologies used for the Company s fair value measurements of non-recurring (level 3) Stonepeak and Evolve unvested warrants at December 31, 2023:

Levo Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock 
 
 Levo is authorized to issue shares of Series B Preferred Stock at no par value. 
 
 The Series B Preferred Stock (a) pays a dividend, when, as and if declared by Levo's Board of Directors, of per annum of the stated value per share, payable quarterly in arrears, (b) has an initial stated value of per share, and dividends are paid in cash. Levo accrues for undeclared and unpaid dividends as they are payable in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. At September 30, 2024, Levo had accumulated unpaid accrued preferred dividends of , included in accrued liabilities, on issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Series B Preferred Stock is not a participating or convertible securities. Series B Preferred Stock is not currently redeemable but it could be redeemable with the passage of time at the election of Levo or the preferred shareholders or upon the occurrence of a trigger event as defined in the preferred stock agreement. Since the redeemable preferred stock may be redeemed by the preferred shareholders or upon the occurrence of a trigger event that is not solely within the control of Levo, but is not mandatorily redeemable; therefore, based on its characteristics, Levo has classified the Series B Preferred Stock as mezzanine equity. 

The Company has determined that the redemption features embedded in the non-controlling redeemable preferred stock is required to be accounted for separately from the redeemable preferred stock as a derivative liability. See Note 5 for detail disclosure of the derivative liability. 
 
 The redeemable preferred stock has been initially recognized at fair value of , the proceeds on the date of issuance. This amount has been further reduced by , the fair value of the embedded derivative liability at date of issuance, resulting in an adjusted initial value of . Levo is accreting the difference between the adjusted carrying initial value and the redemption price value over the period from date of issuance of August 4, 2021 through July 4, 2028 (the date at which the preferred shareholders have the unconditional right to redeem the shares, deemed to be the earliest likely redemption date) using the effective interest method. The accretion to the carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock is treated as a deemed dividend, recorded as a charge to retained earnings of Levo. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Levo accreted resulting in the carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock of . 
 In connection with, and pursuant to Stonepeak and Evolve's sale of their combined interest in Levo to the Company See Note 1 ), the Company became the owner of Levo. As result, the redeemable preferred stock, including the accumulated unpaid accrued preferred dividends, were cancelled. See the tables below.

Profits Interests Units (Class D Incentive Units) 
 
 In April 2022, Levo issued Class D Incentive Units to certain key employees in the form of profits interests within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Service Profits Interests ). Any future distributions under the Profits Interests will only occur once distributions made to all other member units exceed a threshold amount. The Company performed an analysis of the key features of the Profits Interests to determine whether the nature of the Profits Interests are (a) an equity award which should be accounted for under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation or (b) a bonus arrangement which should be accounted for under ASC 710, Compensation General . Based on the features of the Profits Interests, the awards are considered stock compensation to be accounted for as equity. Accordingly, compensation expense for the Profits Interests will be recognized over the vesting period of the awards. 
 
 Subject to the grantee not incurring a termination prior to the applicable vesting date, the Incentive Units will vest as follows: (i) of the Incentive Units will vest in equal installments on each of the first (4) anniversaries of the grant date (such that of the total number of Incentive Units issued to the grantee hereunder will be vested on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date) and (ii) the remaining of the Incentive Units will vest upon a Change of Control. Therefore, the expenses recorded will only reflect the vesting portion. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded compensation expenses, included in selling, general, and administrative, under the Profits Interests of and , respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded compensation expenses, included in selling, general, and administrative, under the Profits Interests of and , respectively.

 References in this Quarterly Report to we, us and our and to Nuvve and the Company are to Nuvve Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Overview 
 We are a green energy technology company that provides, directly and through business ventures with our partners, a globally-available, commercial V2G technology platform that enables EV batteries to store and resell unused energy back to the local electric grid and provide other grid services. Our proprietary V2G technology Grid Integrated Vehicle ("GIVe") platform has the potential to refuel the next generation of EV fleets through cutting-edge, bi-directional charging solutions. 
 Our proprietary V2G technology enables us to link multiple EV batteries into a virtual power plant to provide bi-directional services to the electrical grid. Our GIVe software platform was created to harness capacity from loads at the edge of the distribution grid (i.e., aggregation of EVs and small stationary batteries) in a qualified, controlled and secure manner to provide many of the grid services offered by conventional generation sources (i.e., coal and natural gas plants). Our current addressable energy and capacity markets include grid services such as frequency regulation, demand charge management, demand response, energy optimization, distribution grid services and energy arbitrage. 
 Our customers and partners include owner/operators of light duty fleets, heavy duty fleets (including school buses), automotive manufacturers, charge point operators, and strategic partners (via joint ventures, other business ventures and special purpose financial vehicles). We also operate a small number of company-owned charging stations serving as demonstration projects funded by government grants. We expect growth in company-owned charging stations and the related government grant funding to continue, but for such projects to constitute a declining percentage of our future business as our commercial operations expand. 
 We offer our customers networked charging stations, infrastructure, software, professional services, support, monitoring and parts and labor warranties required to run electric vehicle fleets, as well as low and in some cases free energy costs. We expect to generate revenue primarily from the provision of services to the grid via our GIVe software platform and sales of V2G-enabled charging stations. In the case of light duty fleet and heavy duty fleet customers, we also may receive a mobility fee, which is a recurring fixed payment made by fleet customers per fleet vehicle. In addition, we may generate non-recurring engineering services revenue derived from the integration of our technology with automotive OEMs and charge point operators. In the case of recurring grid services revenue generated via automotive OEM and charge point operator customer integrations, we may also share the recurring grid services revenue with the customer.

Levo 
 On August 4, 2021, we formed Levo Mobility LLC ("Levo"), a Delaware limited liability company, with Stonepeak Rocket Holdings LP ("Stonepeak"), a Delaware limited partnership and Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP ("Evolve"), a Delaware limited partnership. Levo is our consolidated subsidiary. 
 Levo is a sustainable infrastructure company focused on rapidly advancing the electrification of transportation by funding V2G-enabled EV fleet deployments. Levo utilizes our V2G technology and committed capital from Stonepeak and Evolve to offer Fleet-as-a-Service for school buses, last-mile delivery, ride hailing and ride sharing, municipal services, and more to eliminate the primary barriers to EV fleet adoption including large upfront capital investments and lack of expertise in securing and managing EVs and associated charging infrastructure. 
 Levo's turnkey solution simplifies and streamlines electrification, can lower the total cost of EV operation for fleet owners, and support the grid when the EVs are not in use. For a fixed monthly payment with no upfront cost, Levo will provide the EVs, such as electric school buses, charging infrastructure powered by our V2G platform, EV and charging station maintenance, energy management, and technical advice. 
 
 Levo focuses on electrifying school buses, providing associated charging infrastructure, and delivering V2G services to enable safer and healthier transportation for children while supporting carbon dioxide emission reduction, renewable energy integration, and improved grid resiliency. 
 Stonepeak and Evolve conditional capital contribution commitments expired on August 4, 2024. On October 15, 2024 (the Closing Date or Closing ), we, Stonepeak, and Evolve entered into a Limited Liability Company Interest Sale Agreement (the Sale Agreement ), pursuant to which Stonepeak and Evolve sold their combined 49 membership interest in Levo to us for a de minimis price. 
 
 As a result of the Closing, we became the 100 owner of Levo. The Sale Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. 
 
 Deep Impact 
 
 On August 16, 2024, we formed Deep Impact 1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Deep Impact ), with Nuvve CPO Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary Nuvve CPO ), and WISE EV-LLC WISE ). We hold a 51 equity interest by way of Nuvve CPO, and WISE holds a 49 equity interest. Deep Impact is an entity formed for the principal purpose of operation, installation, maintenance of electric vehicle chargers and other related activities and services created as a business venture between us, Nuvve CPO and WISE. Nuvve CPO Inc., or Nuvve Charge Point Operator, was established in August 2024 to support the deployment and ongoing support of our customers charging station networks. 
 
 In connection with Deep Impact, Nuvve CPO, WISE and Deep Impact entered into a Contribution and Unit Purchase Agreement (the Contribution Agreement ), pursuant to which Nuvve CPO and WISE agreed to contribute 51 and 49, respectively, to Deep Impact, and to provide certain services pursuant to separate services agreements with Deep Impact. For such contributions and the services, Nuvve CPO received 51 membership units in Deep Impact, equal to a 51 equity interest, and WISE received 49 membership units in Deep Impact, equal to a 49 equity interest. 
 
 We have determined that Deep Impact is a VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidate Deep Impact and record a non-controlling interest for the share of the entity owned by WISE. 

Backlog 
 Our total backlog represents the estimated future transaction price values for unsatisfied and partially satisfied estimated product and service deliveries to our customers. Backlog is generally determine based upon customer issued purchased orders or contracts with customers. Backlog does not include agreements we have with customers to earn future grid service revenues. Backlog is converted into revenue in future periods as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers for our products and services, primarily based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable accounting method. 
 Our estimated backlog on September 30, 2024, was 17.5 million, which we expect to be earned in future periods. We anticipate recognizing revenue from this backlog from 2024 through 2026.

The decrease in net loss was primarily due to an increase in other income of 0.1 million, and a decrease in operating expenses of 7.4 million, which includes a decrease in cost of product and services of 1.5 million, and a decrease in revenue of 0.8 million, for the above aforementioned reasons. 
 Net loss decreased by 11.6 million, or 48.6 , from 24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to an increase in other income of 1.8 million, and a decrease in operating expenses of 13.0 million, which includes a decrease in cost of product and services of 3.8 million, and a decrease in revenue of 3.2 million, for the above aforementioned reasons. 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to n et income attributable to non-controlling interest of 0.01 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was 0.00 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to n et income attributable to non-controlling interest of 0.02 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net income (loss) was allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to the relative ownership interests of the holders of non-controlling interests in Levo, an entity formed by us with Stonepeak and Evolve. We owned 51 of Levo's common units and Stonepeak and Evolve owned 49 of Levo's common units. We had determined that Levo was a variable interest entity VIE in which we were the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we had consolidated Levo and recorded a non-controlling interest for the share of Levo owned by Stonepeak and Evolve during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Stonepeak and Evolve conditional capital contribution commitments expired on August 4, 2024. On October 15, 2024, we, Stonepeak, and Evolve entered into Sale Agreement, pursuant to which Stonepeak and Evolve sold their combined 49 membership interest in Levo to us for a de minimis price. As a result of the Closing, we became the 100 owner of Levo.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We are still an early-stage business enterprise. We have not yet demonstrated a sustained ability to generate sufficient revenue from sales of our technology and services or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for the successful commercialization of our GIVe platform. We have not yet achieved profitability and have experienced substantial net losses, and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We have incurred operating losses of approximately 14.8 million as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 32.1 million and 36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our cash used in operations were 12.2 million as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 21.3 million and 34.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance, working capital, and total equity of 0.3 million, 1.3 million and 3.0 million, respectively. 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. We have funded our business operations primarily with the issuance of equity, debt obligations and cash from operations. We plan to fund current operations through debt obligations, increased revenues and raising additional capital. Please see below for details. However, there can be no assurance we will be successful in raising necessary funds in the future, on acceptable terms or at all.

The combined price per share of Common Stock and the accompanying Series A Warrant, Series B Warrant and Series C Warrant was 20.00. The combined price per share of each Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Series A Warrant, Series B Warrant, and Series C Warrant was equal to 19.9990, and the exercise price of each Pre-Funded warrant is 0.0010 per share. The Series C Warrants may only be exercised to the extent and in proportion to a holder of the Series C Warrants exercising its Series B Warrants, and are subject to an early expiration of nine months, in proportion and only to the extent any Series C Warrants expire unexercised.

 Shelf Registration 
 On April 25, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us, subject to limitations under the baby shelf rules discussed below, to issue unspecified amounts of common stock, preferred stock, warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock or preferred stock, debt securities, and units consisting of any combination of any of the foregoing securities, in one or more series, from time to time and in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of 100.0 million. The shelf registration statement was declared effective on May 5, 2022. Our ability to utilize the full capacity of our shelf registration, or any future shelf registration on Form S-3, is limited by our compliance with the baby shelf rules. Pursuant to the baby shelf rules promulgated by the SEC, if our public float is less than 75.0 million as of specified measurement periods, the number of 
 42 

securities that may be offered and sold by us under a Form S-3 registration statement, including pursuant to our shelf registration statement, in any twelve-month period is limited to an aggregate amount that does not exceed one-third of our public float. As a result, we will be limited by the baby shelf rules until such time our public float exceeds 75 million, which means we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of our public float under shelf registration statements in any twelve-month period. 
 Fresno Economic Opportunities Commission ("Fresno EOC")

 Levo 
 On August 4, 2021, we formed Levo with Stonepeak and Evolve to rapidly accelerate the deployment of electric fleets, including zero-emission electric school buses for school districts in the United States through V2G hubs and Transportation as a service ("TaaS"). Levo utilized our proprietary V2G technology, and the conditional capital contribution commitments from Stonepeak and Evolve of 750 million, subject to project approval process as outlined under the terms of the definitive agreements, to fund acquisition of electric fleets, and construction of EV infrastructure. Stonepeak and Evolve had the option to increase their conditional capital contribution commitments to 1.0 billion when Levo had entered into contracts with third parties for 500 million in aggregate capital expenditures.

Working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by, among other items, lower net loss of 12.3 million, resulting from decrease in operating expenses and lower revenue.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on its historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of our 2023 Form 10-K. For a summary of our critical accounting estimates, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Accounting Election 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(A) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 The Company expects to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public business entities and non-public business entities until the earlier of the date the Company (a) is no longer an emerging growth company or (b) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare the Company s financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. See Note 2 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Nuvve included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for the recent accounting pronouncements adopted and the recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the Company intends to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, the Company intends to rely on such exemptions, the Company is not required to, among other things: (a) provide an auditor s attestation report on the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (b) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (c) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); or (d) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 
 The Company will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2025, which the last day of the Company s first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of Newborn s IPO, (b) the last date of the Company s fiscal year in which the Company has total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (c) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC with at least 700.0 million of outstanding securities held by non-affiliates or (d) the date on which the Company has issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The information required to be set forth under this Part II, Item 1 is incorporated by reference to Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. In addition, regardless of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Below we are providing, in supplemental form, changes to our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 provide additional discussion regarding these supplemental risks and we encourage you to read and carefully consider all of the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, together with the below, for a more complete understanding of the risks and uncertainties material to our business. 
 
 We received notice from Nasdaq that our stockholders equity is below 2,500,000. Our failure to meet Nasdaq s continued listing standards could result in the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, negatively impact the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell their shares. We are not in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market the minimum stockholders equity requirement and our failure to meet Nasdaq s continued listing standards could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital. 
 
 On May 22, 2024, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that we are not currently in compliance with the requirement of maintaining stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders Equity Rule ). In each of the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company reported stockholders equity of less than 2,500,000. On July 5, 2024, we provided Nasdaq a plan regarding how we expect to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule. Following discussions with Nasdaq, we submitted additional information relating to our plan to regain compliance on August 23, 2024. Nasdaq subsequently granted us an extension to November 18, 2024 to evidence compliance with the rule. There may be no assurances that our plan of compliance will be successful or that we will be able to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule. If we fail to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule we may be subject to the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 
 Additionally, if we fail to comply with any other continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock will also be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our common stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. This would significantly and negatively affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly and negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. 

48 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 In July 2024, the Company granted pre-funded warrants (the Consulting Warrant to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 shares of Common Stock to a consultant of the Company as compensation for certain consulting services rendered. The Consulting Warrant is exercisable, in part or in full, for shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of 0.001 per share. On September 26, 2024, the Company issued 30,000 shares of Common Stock upon the partial exercise of the Consulting Warrant. 
 
 The issuance of the securities described herein were made pursuant to the exemption from the registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The securities issued have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 
 
 Other than the foregoing, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were not previously included in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information.
