 Senior Credit Facility 
 We maintain a million senior credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) which includes a senior term loan facility with aggregate commitments of million (Term Loan Facility) and a senior revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of million (Senior Revolving Credit Facility). The Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on the closing date with the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility used to refinance the loans and commitments outstanding under the existing facility. The Term Loan Facility requires principal amortization payments which began on March 31, 2023, at a rate of per quarter through the end of 2024, increasing to per quarter thereafter until maturity. The maturity date for the Senior Credit Facility is October 11, 2027. 
 The Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility. At September 30, 2024, we had million available under our million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had million borrowed under the facility and issued million of letters of credit. During the second quarter of 2024, we utilized our Senior Revolving Credit Facility to repay million of Go Zone and million of Recovery Zone tax-exempt variable-rate bonds. 
 We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of September 30, 2024, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As a result of our restrictive covenant related to the net leverage ratio, the maximum additional borrowings available to us could be limited in the future. The limitation, if an amendment or waiver from our lenders is not obtained, could restrict our ability to borrow the maximum amounts available under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Financing Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow.

 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA") was enacted and provides various beneficial credits for energy efficient related manufacturing, transportation and fuels, hydrogen/carbon recapture and renewable energy, which we are evaluating in regard to planned projects. We will continue to monitor the expected impacts of any new guidance on our filing positions and will record the impacts as discrete income tax expense adjustments in the period the guidance is finalized or becomes effective.

 As of September 30, 2024, we believe it is reasonably possible that our total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million over the next twelve months. The anticipated reduction primarily relates to expected settlements with tax authorities and the expiration of federal, state and foreign statutes of limitation. 
 We operate globally and file income tax returns in numerous jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to examination by various federal, state and local tax authorities. Additionally, examinations are ongoing in various states and foreign jurisdictions. We believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions; however, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position.

 Dividend yield was based on our current dividend yield as of the option grant date. Risk-free interest rate was based on zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities rates for the expected life of the options. Expected volatility was based on our historical stock price movements, as we believe that historical experience is the best available indicator of the expected volatility. Expected life of the option grant was based on historical exercise and cancellation patterns, as we believe that historical experience is the best estimate for future exercise patterns. 
 Performance Shares 
 Performance share awards are denominated in shares of our stock and are paid half in cash and half in stock. Payouts for performance share awards are based on two criteria: (1) of the award is based on Olin s total shareholder returns (TSR) over the applicable -year performance cycle in relation to the TSR over the same period among a portfolio of public companies which are selected in concert with outside compensation consultants and (2) of the award is based on Olin s net income over the applicable -year performance cycle in relation to the net income goal for such period as set by the Compensation Committee of Olin s Board of Directors. The expense associated with performance shares is recorded based on our estimate of our performance relative to the respective target. If an employee leaves the company before the end of the performance cycle, the performance shares may be prorated based on the number of months of the performance cycle worked and are settled in cash instead of half in cash and half in stock when the three-year performance cycle is completed.

 Environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 million, million and million, respectively. These liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation. Based on our analysis, and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
 During the ordinary course of our business, contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency. In certain instances, such as environmental projects, we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site. There exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties. We account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450 Contingencies and, therefore, do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable.

 Ethane Metals Total notional 
 As of September 30, 2024, the counterparties to these commodity contracts were Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Toronto Dominion Bank and Bank of America Corporation, all of which are major financial institutions. 
 We use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper, zinc, lead, ethane, electricity and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy used in our manufacturing process. At September 30, 2024, we had open derivative contract positions through 2028. If all open futures contracts had been settled on September 30, 2024, we would have recognized a pretax gain of million. 
 If commodity prices were to remain at September 30, 2024 levels, approximately million of deferred gains, net of tax, would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. The actual effect on earnings will be dependent on actual commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 We use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) in the same line item, interest expense, as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps. There were no outstanding interest rate swaps at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. 
 Financial Statement Impacts 
 We present our derivative assets and liabilities in our condensed balance sheets on a net basis whenever we have a legally enforceable master netting agreement with the counterparty to our derivative contracts. We use these agreements to manage and substantially reduce our potential counterparty credit risk.

 Credit Risk and Collateral 
 By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, our credit risk will equal the fair value gain in a derivative. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this indicates that the counterparty owes us, thus creating a repayment risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, assume no repayment risk. We minimize the credit (or repayment) risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. We monitor our positions and the credit ratings of our counterparties, and we do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. 
 Based on the agreements with our various counterparties, cash collateral is required to be provided when the net fair value of the derivatives, with the counterparty, exceeds a specific threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, cash is either provided by the counterparty to us if the value of the derivatives is our asset, or cash is provided by us to the counterparty if the value of the derivatives is our liability. As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, this threshold was not exceeded. In all instances where we are party to a master netting agreement, we offset the receivable or payable recognized upon payment of cash collateral against the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have also been offset under such master netting agreements.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 BUSINESS BACKGROUND 
 Olin Corporation (Olin) is a Virginia corporation, incorporated in 1892, having its principal executive offices in Clayton, MO. We are a leading vertically integrated global manufacturer and distributor of chemical products and a leading U.S. manufacturer of ammunition. Our operations are concentrated in three business segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 Epoxy and Winchester. All of our business segments are capital-intensive manufacturing businesses. The Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment manufactures and sells chlorine and caustic soda, ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer, methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen, bleach products and potassium hydroxide. The Epoxy segment produces and sells a full range of epoxy materials and precursors, including aromatics (acetone and phenol), allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, liquid epoxy resins, solid epoxy resins and systems and growth products such as converted epoxy resins and additives. The Winchester segment produces and sells sporting ammunition, reloading components, small caliber military ammunition and components, industrial cartridges and clay targets. 
 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Overview 
 Net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was (24.9) million and 97.9 million, respectively, compared to 104.1 million and 407.3 million, for the prior year periods, respectively. The decrease of 129.0 million and 309.4 million, respectively, in net (loss) income from the prior year periods was primarily due to a decline in operating results across our Chemicals businesses. The operating results from our Winchester segment were lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 but were higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also reflects a gain of 27.0 million for the sale of our domestic private trucking fleet and operations. Diluted net (loss) income per share was (0.21) and 0.81 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.82 and 3.12 in the prior year periods, respectively, a decrease of 1.03 and 2.31 per share. 
 Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls reported segment income was 45.3 million and 221.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results were lower than the comparable prior year periods due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl and lower pricing, primarily caustic soda. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from lower raw material and operating costs, and costs associated with products purchased from other parties, compared to last year. The Chlor Alkali and Vinyls segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by higher costs and reduced profit from lost sales of 25.3 million and 104.2 million, respectively, associated with operating issues related to a 2023 second quarter maintenance turnaround at our vinyl chloride monomer plant at the Freeport, TX facility. 
 Epoxy reported a segment loss of 42.8 million and 57.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Epoxy segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the comparable prior year period primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl, partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs. Epoxy segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the comparable prior year period primarily due to lower product pricing and the impact of Hurricane Beryl, partially offset by increased volumes and lower raw material and operating costs. 
 Winchester reported segment income of 53.4 million and 195.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Winchester segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the comparable prior year period due to higher commodity and operating costs, including propellant costs. Winchester segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the comparable prior year period due to higher sales volumes, which included White Flyer results, partially offset by higher commodity and operating costs, including propellant costs. Higher international military sales, military project revenue, and White Flyer sales were partially offset by lower commercial ammunition sales. 
 Liquidity and Share Repurchases 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired 4.9 million shares of common stock at a total value of 256.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 742.0 million of remaining authorized common stock to be repurchased under our 2022 Repurchase Authorization Program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net borrowings of 216.7 million with 282.0 million borrowed under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which was partially utilized to repay 70.0 million of tax-exempt variable-rate bonds, and 11.3 million under our Receivables Financing Agreement.

 Other Items 
 On July 10, 2024, we announced a temporary disruption of operations at our Freeport, TX, facility as a result of Hurricane Beryl. In response to this disruption, we declared a system-wide force majeure for our Chlor Alkali Products Vinyls products and aromatics shipments for our Epoxy segment. This disruption was a result of hurricane-related damage to Olin facilities in Freeport, TX, impacting Olin s normal production and logistics capabilities including access to power, raw materials, and other essential feedstocks and services. During the third quarter, we safely returned many Freeport, TX plants to operation and on August 28, 2024, we lifted the system wide force majeure on Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls products. However, persistent operating limitations necessitated an additional outage, w hich we commenced in late September and successfully completed during October. 
 The third quarter 2024 results included a negative pretax impact of 109.4 million associated with Hurricane Beryl for incremental costs to restore operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs, and reduced profit from lost sales. The Hurricane Beryl impact included in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segment results was 76.7 million and 32.7 million, respectively. We expect a residual fourth quarter Hurricane Beryl impact of approximately 25 million in our Chemicals businesses results. 
 Epoxy segment results in 2024 continue to be impacted by significant exports out of Asia into the European and North American markets, negatively impacting pricing and volumes. On April 3, 2024, we announced the filing of anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions against China, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission relating to certain epoxy resins, as part of the U.S. Epoxy Resin Producers Ad Hoc Coalition. The petitions were filed in response to large volumes of low-priced imports of epoxy resins into the U.S. from the subject countries over the past three years that have injured U.S. domestic epoxy resin producers. 
 On July 1, 2024, we announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding by the European Commission against China, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand concerning low-priced imports of epoxy resins into the European Union (EU), as a result of a complaint lodged by the Ad Hoc Coalition of Epoxy Resin Producers. The complaint alleges that exporting producers in the four targeted countries have injured the European epoxy resin producers by selling their products on the EU market at unfairly low prices that significantly undercut the prices of European producers. 
 During 2024, the U.S. Army awarded Winchester a contract for the construction of the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) manufacturing facility at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. The project will be the first new manufacturing plant built at the Lake City facility in decades. The new manufacturing facility will provide safe, reliable, and advanced NGSW ammunition to the U.S. warfighter. Winchester will manage all aspects of the government-funded construction project, which commenced in the second quarter of 2024.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,589.5 million compared to 1,671.4 million in the same period last year, a decrease of 81.9 million, or 5 . Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales decreased by 98.0 million primarily due to lower pricing, primarily caustic soda. Epoxy sales decreased by 36.5 million, primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily as a result of Hurricane Beryl. Winchester sales increased by 52.6 million, primarily due to third quarter 2024 sales from White Flyer and increased sales to international military customers and military project revenue, partially offset by lower commercial ammunition sales. 
 Gross margin decreased 134.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by 117.7 million primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl and lower pricing, primarily caustic soda. Epoxy gross margin decreased by 11.0 million primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl, partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs. Winchester gross margin decreased by 6.9 million primarily due to higher commodity and operating costs, including propellant costs. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 8 in 2024 from 16 in 2023, across all segments. 
 Selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 111.7 million, an increase of 20.8 million from the prior year. The increase was primar ily due to higher legal and legal-related settlement expense of 11.9 million, consulting and contract services of 2.3 million, and stock-based compensation expense of 2.2 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 7 in 2024 from 5 in 2023. 
 Restructuring charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7.9 million and 11.9 million, respectively. Restructuring charges were primarily associated with our 2023 actions to reconfigure our global Epoxy asset footprint to optimize the most productive and cost effective assets to support our strategic operating model, which resulted in pretax restructuring charges of 6.3 million and 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense increased by 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the prior year, primarily due to higher average interest rates.

 Non-operating pension income includes all components of pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit (income) cost, other than service costs. Non-operating pension income was higher for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine interest costs, partially offset by higher actuarial losses recognized to income. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a net 2.9 million tax expense, primarily associated with a change in tax contingencies and remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in our state effective tax rates, partially offset by a benefit from prior year tax positions. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 11.5 was lower than the 21.0 U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income tax, foreign income inclusions and an increase in the estimated annual effective tax rate, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a net 7.2 million tax benefit, primarily associated with stock-based compensation and prior year tax positions, partially offset by an expense from a change in tax contingencies. Excluding these items, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 23.2 was higher than the 21.0 U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income tax and an increase in the valuation allowance related to losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by favorable permanent salt depletion deductions and foreign income taxes.

Epoxy sales decreased by 72.0 million, primarily due to lower product pricing, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Winchester sales increased by 134.9 million, primarily due to 2024 sales from White Flyer and increased sales to international military customers and military project revenue. 
 Gross margin decreased 402.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls gross margin decreased by 360.9 million primarily due to lower pricing, primarily caustic soda, partially offset by lower costs. Epoxy gross margin decreased by 50.9 million primarily due to lower product pricing, partially offset by increased volumes. Winchester gross margin increased by 4.1 million primarily due to higher sales volume, including White Flyer, partially offset by higher commodity and operating costs, including propellant costs. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 12 in 2024 from 19 in 2023, across all segments. 
 Selling and administration expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 308.2 million, an increase of 4.3 million from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher legal and legal-related settlement expense of 13.6 million, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact of 3.0 million and lower stock-based compensation expense of 2.7 million, which includes mark-to-market adjustments. Sellin g and administration expenses as a percentage of sales was 6 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Restructuring charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 23.0 million and 92.0 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to charges associated with our 2023 actions to reconfigure our global Epoxy asset footprint to optimize the most productive and cost effective assets to support our strategic operating model, which resulted in pretax restructuring charges of 15.6 million and 79.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of 27.0 million for the sale of our domestic private trucking fleet and operations.

 SEGMENT RESULTS 
 We define segment results as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), non-operating pension income, other income and income taxes. We have three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy and Winchester. The three operating segments reflect the organization used by our management for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Chlorine and caustic soda used in our Epoxy segment is transferred at cost from the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment.

The decrease in segment results of 14.0 million was due to the negative impact of Hurricane Beryl resulting in incremental costs to restore operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs, and reduced profit from lost sales 32.7 million) and decreased volumes 1.3 million), partially offset by lower raw material and operating costs 20.0 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of 13.7 million and 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Epoxy sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 944.1 million compared to 1,016.1 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 72.0 million, or 7 . The sales decrease was due to lower product prices 132.6 million) and an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 4.5 million), partially offset by increased sales volumes 65.1 million), which were negatively impacted by Hurricane Beryl. 
 Epoxy segment loss was 57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to segment loss of 7.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in segment results of 49.7 million was due to lower product prices 133.4 million), which continues to be impacted by significant exports out of Asia into the European and North American markets, and the negative impact of Hurricane Beryl resulting in incremental costs to restore operations, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs, and reduced profit from lost sales 32.7 million), partially offset by increased volumes and improved product mix 82.2 million) and lower raw material and operating costs 34.2 million). A significant percentage of our Euro denominated sales are of products manufactured within Europe. As a result, the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue is primarily offset by the impact of foreign currency translation on raw materials and manufacturing costs also denominated in Euros. Epoxy segment results included depreciation and amortization expense of 40.6 million and 44.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Winchester 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Winchester sales were 432.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 380.2 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 52.6 million, or 14 . The increase was due to higher sales to domestic and international military customers 43.5 million), higher sales to commercial customers 10.4 million), partially offset by lower sales to law enforcement agencies 1.3 million). Commercial sales were primarily impacted by 2024 sales from White Flyer, partially

 Winchester segment income was 53.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 64.5 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 11.1 million. The decrease in segment results was due to higher commodity and operating costs 17.2 million), including propellant costs, partially offset by higher sales volumes 4.1 million), which includes White Flyer, and higher product pricing 2.0 million). Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of 8.5 million and 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Winchester sales were 1,248.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,113.3 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 134.9 million, or 12 . The increase was due to higher sales to commercial customers 75.3 million) and higher sales to domestic and international military customers 70.1 million), partially offset by lower sales to law enforcement agencies 10.5 million).

Winchester segment income included depreciation and amortization expense of 24.7 million and 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Corporate/Other 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were 7.2 million compared to 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other corporate and unallocated costs were 25.9 million compared to 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.0 million. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation 2.2 million), which includes mark-to-market adjustments, and higher legal and legal-related settlement expenses 1.6 million). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were 19.4 million compared to 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These charges related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other corporate and unallocated costs were 68.7 million compared to 79.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 10.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation costs 6.3 million), which includes mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation expense, and a favorable foreign currency impact 3.0 million). 
 Restructurings 
 In connection with the previously announced Epoxy Optimization Plan, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded restructuring charges of 6.3 million and 8.6 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded restructuring charges of 15.6 million and 79.7 million, respectively. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2025 of approximately 10 million related to these actions. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred charges of 1.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred charges of 7.4 million and 12.3 million, respectively, associated with other previously disclosed restructuring plans. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges through 2027 of approximately 40 million related to these actions. Discussion on our restructuring activity, including a description of each plan, is referenced under Item 1, within Note 4, Restructuring Charges. Pretax restructuring charges related to our actions include facility exit costs, lease and other contract termination costs, employee severance and related benefits costs and the write-off of equipment and facilities.

 OUTLOOK 
 In the third quarter 2024, our Chemicals businesses were able to safely return multiple Freeport, TX, plants to operation after Hurricane Beryl, completing our efforts during October. In the third quarter 2024, we incurred a negative 109.4 million impact from Hurricane Beryl, and we anticipate a residual negative fourth quarter impact of approximately 25 million on our Chemicals businesses results. Excluding the Hurricane Beryl impact, we expect our Chemicals businesses fourth quarter 2024 results to seasonally decline from the third quarter 2024. 
 We expect our Winchester business fourth quarter results to decline from third quarter levels with seasonally weaker commercial ammunition demand and inventory destocking by our retail customers. 
 Other corporate and unallocated costs in 2024 are expected to be comparable with the 106.3 million in 2023. 
 During 2024, we anticipate environmental expenses in the 25 million to 30 million range, compared to 23.7 million in 2023. 
 We expect non-operating pension income in 2024 to be similar to the 24.0 million in 2023. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2024. We have several international qualified defined benefit pension plans for which we anticipate cash contributions of less than 5 million in 2024. 
 In 2024, we currently expect our capital spending to be approximately 200 million, including approximately 10 million of additional capital associated with Hurricane Beryl. Our payments under other long-term supply contracts for energy modernization on the U.S. Gulf Coast will be 58.6 million as we made our final payment during the third quarter 2024. We expect 2024 depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately 525 million. 
 We currently believe the 2024 effective tax rate will be in the 25 to 30 range and cash taxes paid to be approximately 110 million. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 Environmental provisions charged to income, which are included in costs of goods sold, were 7.2 million and 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 19.4 million and 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The following table summarizes the environmental liability activity: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Environmental Liabilities in millions) Balance at beginning of year 153.6 146.6 Charges to income 19.4 23.1 Remedial and investigatory spending (18.8) (16.2) Balance at end of period 154.2 153.5 
 Environmental investigatory and remediation activities spending was associated with former waste disposal sites and past manufacturing operations. Spending in 2024 for investigatory and remedial efforts, the timing of which is subject to regulatory approvals and other uncertainties, is estimated to be approximately 30 million. Cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste disposal sites and past manufacturing operations were not charged to income, but instead, were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior periods. Associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs. Our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages. With respect to unasserted claims, we accrue liabilities for costs that, in our experience, we expect to incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims. Our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to 11.7 million at September 30, 2024. With respect to asserted claims, we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation, feasibility study, remedial action and operation, maintenance and monitoring (OM M) expenses that, in our experience, we expect to incur in connection with the asserted claims. Required site OM M expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding 30 years, which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long-term site OM M. Charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts may be material to our operating results in 2024.

Table of Contents 

 The condensed balance sheets included reserves for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to 154.2 million, 153.6 million and 153.5 million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, of which 122.2 million, 121.6 million and 128.5 million, respectively, were classified as other noncurrent liabilities. These amounts do not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology. These liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and/or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed. As a result of these reassessments, future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities. 
 Environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons, including the identification of new sites, developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies, advances in technology, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application, changes in regulatory authorities, the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites, the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs. It is possible that some of these matters (the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties) may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 LEGAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash Flow Data 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash Provided by (Used for) in millions) Net operating activities 361.5 557.7 Capital expenditures (144.1) (173.0) Payments under other long-term supply contracts (58.6) (46.2) Proceeds from disposition of property, plant and equipment 28.8 Net investing activities (207.0) (194.0) Long-term debt borrowings, net 216.7 206.6 Common stock repurchased and retired (256.8) (595.1) Stock options exercised 22.6 22.3 Dividends paid (70.9) (76.6) Contributions received from noncontrolling interests 44.1 Net financing activities (98.9) (398.7) 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities decreased by 196.2 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a smaller increase in working capital compared with the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, working capital increased 58.7 million compared to an increase of 172.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 77.2 million from December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of timing of payments during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Capital spending was 144.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 173.0 million for the comparable period in 2023. Our capital spending forecast represents normal capital spending to maintain our current operating facilities. For the full year 2024, we expect our capital spending to be approximately 200 million, including 10 million of additional capital associated with Hurricane Beryl. We expect 2024 depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately 525 million.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, payments under other long-term supply contracts were 58.6 million for energy modernization on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our payments for this project were completed in the third quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 28.5 million of cash proceeds for the sale of our domestic private trucking fleet and operations. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had long-term debt borrowings, net of repayments, of 216.7 million and 206.6 million, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 4.9 million and 10.8 million shares, respectively, of common stock were repurchased and retired at a total value of 256.8 million and 595.1 million, respectively. 
 We issued 0.9 million and 0.8 million shares representing stock options exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a total value of 22.6 million and 22.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we withheld and paid 10.5 million for employee taxes on share-based payment arrangements. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 44.1 million of cash contributions from noncontrolling interests for BWA. 
 The percent of total debt to total capitalization increased to 58.0 as of September 30, 2024 from 54.1 as of December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of a higher level of debt outstanding and lower shareholders equity, primarily due to common stock repurchases partially offset by our operating results. 
 In the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, we paid a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per share. Dividends paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 70.9 million and 76.6 million, respectively. On October 24rd, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.20 per share on our common stock, payable on December 13th, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 14th, 2024. 
 The payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be determined in light of then-current conditions, including our earnings, our operations, our financial condition, our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. In the future, our Board of Directors may change our dividend policy, including the frequency or amount of any dividend, in light of then-existing conditions. 
 Liquidity and Other Financing Arrangements 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Receivables Financing Agreement (as defined below) and AR Facilities (as defined below). Additionally, we believe that we have access to the high-yield debt and equity markets. 
 We maintain a 1,550.0 million senior credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) which includes a senior term loan facility with aggregate commitments of 350.0 million (Term Loan Facility) and a senior revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of 1,200.0 million (Senior Revolving Credit Facility). The Term Loan Facility was fully drawn on the closing date with the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility used to refinance the loans and commitments outstanding under the existing facility. The Term Loan Facility requires principal amortization payments which began on March 31, 2023 at a rate of 0.625 per quarter through the end of 2024, increasing to 1.250 per quarter thereafter until maturity. The maturity date for the Senior Credit Facility is October 11, 2027. 
 The Senior Revolving Credit Facility includes a 100.0 million letter of credit subfacility. At September 30, 2024, we had 849.6 million available under our 1,200.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility because we had 350.0 million borrowed under the facility and issued 0.4 million of letters of credit. During 2024, the Senior Revolving Credit Facility borrowings were partially utilized to repay 50.0 million of Go Zone and 20.0 million of Recovery Zone tax-exempt variable-rate bonds. 
 We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of September 30, 2024, and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured. In the future, our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows, among other factors, will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities. As a result of our restrictive covenant related to the net leverage ratio, the maximum additional borrowings available to us could be limited in the future. The limitation, if an amendment or waiver from our lenders is not obtained, could restrict our ability to borrow the maximum amounts available under the Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Financing Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow.

 We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flow from our operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and AR Facilities, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs, to make required payments of interest on our debt, fund our operating needs, working capital and our capital expenditure requirements, and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements. 
 On July 28, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of shares of common stock at an aggregate price of up to 2.0 billion. This program will terminate upon the purchase of 2.0 billion of common stock. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 4.9 million shares of common stock have been repurchased and retired at a total value of 256.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, 24.2 million shares of common stock have been repurchased and retired at a total value of 1,258.0 million under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization program, and 742.0 million of common stock remained authorized to be repurchased under the program. 
 We maintain a 425.0 million Receivables Financing Agreement (Receivables Financing Agreement) that is scheduled to mature on October 14, 2025. Under the Receivables Financing Agreement, our eligible trade receivables are used for collateralized borrowings and continue to be serviced by us. In addition, the Receivables Financing Agreement incorporates the net leverage ratio covenant that is contained in the Senior Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, we had 339.8 million, 328.5 million and 350.0 million, respectively, drawn under the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, 473.9 million of our trade receivables were pledged as collateral and we had 0.3 million additional borrowing capacity under the Receivables Financing Agreement, which was limited by our borrowing base. 
 Olin also has trade accounts receivable factoring arrangements (AR Facilities) and pursuant to the terms of the AR Facilities, certain of our domestic subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of 134.5 million and certain of our foreign subsidiaries may sell their accounts receivable up to a maximum of 16.5 million. We will continue to service the outstanding accounts sold. These receivables qualify for sales treatment under ASC 860 and, accordingly, the proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the condensed statements of cash flows. 
 The following table summarizes the AR facilities activity: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 AR Facilities in millions) Balance at beginning of period 63.3 111.8 Gross receivables sold 528.5 749.5 Payments received from customers on sold accounts (539.5) (788.6) Balance at end of period 52.3 72.7 
 The factoring discount paid under the AR Facilities is recorded as interest expense on the condensed statements of operations. The factoring discount was 0.8 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.9 million and 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The agreements are without recourse and therefore no recourse liability has been recorded as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 At September 30, 2024, we had total letters of credit of 167.3 million outstanding, of which 0.4 million were issued under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The letters of credit were used to support certain long-term debt obligations, workers compensation insurance policies, plant closure and post-closure obligations, international payment obligations and international pension funding requirements. 
 Our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had long-term borrowings, including the current installment, of 2,889.5 million, of which 1,110.4 million were at variable rates. Included within long-term borrowings on the condensed balance sheets were deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized bond original issue discount of 14.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and AR Facilities are additional sources of liquidity. 
 We have registered an undetermined number of securities with the SEC, so that, from time-to-time we may issue debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement. 
 Credit Ratings 
 We receive ratings from three independent credit rating agencies: Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard Poor's (S P). The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 Credit Rating Agency Long-term Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings BBB- Stable Moody s Investors Service Ba1 Stable Standard Poor s BB+ Stable 
 
 On August 8, 2024, S P affirmed Olin s BB+ rating and revised its outlook from positive to stable. On June 24, 2024, Moody s affirmed Olin s Ba1 rating and stable outlook. On March 14, 2024, Fitch affirmed Olin s BBB- rating and stable outlook. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs. We have supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. These agreements are maintained through long-term cost based contracts that provide us with a reliable supply of key raw materials. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 Discussion of new accounting pronouncements can be referred to under Item 1, within Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities, our ongoing investing and financing activities and our operations that use foreign currencies. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. 
 Energy costs, including electricity and natural gas, and certain raw materials used in our production processes are subject to price volatility. Depending on market conditions, we may enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, commodity swaps and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained open positions on commodity contracts with a notional value totaling 207.2 million 191.0 million at December 31, 2023, and 207.5 million at September 30, 2023). Assuming a hypothetical 10 increase in commodity prices which are currently hedged, as of September 30, 2024, we would experience a 20.7 million 19.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 20.8 million at September 30, 2023) increase in our cost of inventory purchased, which would be substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments. 
 We transact business in various foreign currencies other than the USD which exposes us to movements in exchange rates which may impact revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows. Our significant foreign currency exposure is denominated with European currencies, primarily the Euro, although exposures also exist in other currencies of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. For all derivative positions, we evaluated the effects of a 10 shift in exchange rates 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 between those currencies and the USD, holding all other assumptions constant. Unfavorable currency movements of 10 would negatively affect the fair values of the derivatives held to hedge currency exposures by 14.9 million. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities. Our current debt structure is used to fund business operations, and commitments from banks under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and AR Facilities are additional sources of liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, we had long-term borrowings, including current installments and finance lease obligations, of 2,889.5 million, 2,670.1 million and 2,790.1 million, respectively, of which 1,110.4 million, 893.7 million and 1,014.3 million at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, were issued at variable rates. Included within long-term borrowings on the condensed balance sheets were deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized bond original issue discount. 
 Assuming no changes in the 1,110.4 million of variable-rate debt levels from September 30, 2024, we estimate that a hypothetical change of 100-basis points in the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) would impact annual interest expense by 11.1 million. 
 If the actual changes in commodities, foreign currency, or interest pricing is substantially different than expected, the net impact of commodity risk, foreign currency risk, or interest rate risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above. 
 We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Olin is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on management s beliefs, certain assumptions made by management, forecasts of future results, and current expectations, estimates and projections about the markets and economy in which we and our various segments operate.

If the Compensation of an Active Participant is changed, the dollar amount of his Tax Deferred Contributions will automatically be changed so that the percentage elected is not changed.

Excess distributions made after April 15 th of the following calendar year will be taxable as provided under the Code. 
 (c) Subject to the following, an Active Participant eligible to have Tax Deferred Contributions made on his behalf may elect to completely suspend such contributions or to change the percentage of the reduction in his Compensation. Such election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Administrative Committee shall determine, and shall be effective only in accordance with such rules as shall be established from time to time by the Administrative Committee. 
 (i) For Eligible Employees hired on or after November 1, 2006, and provided that such newly hired Eligible Employee during the Opt Out Period does not make any contrary election (such as electing to not participate in the Plan, or electing to participate in the Plan at an earlier or different time, or electing a different Tax Deferred Contribution, Taxed Contribution or Roth 401(k) Contribution percentage), such Eligible Employee shall participate in the Plan as soon as administratively feasible on or after the expiration of the Opt Out Period and the percentage of the reduction in his Compensation shall be set at 6 . Such Tax Deferred Contribution rate may be changed in accordance with applicable Plan terms. The manner and form for making a contrary election during the Opt Out Period shall be set by the Administrative Committee, and the default investment for such contributions (to the extent the Participant does not provide affirmative investment direction) shall be an age-based retirement Fund with the date closest to the Participant s anticipated retirement date (assuming such person retires at age 65) (or such other Fund as may be designated by the Investment Committee).

The Plan Administrator shall administer the ADP test in accordance with IRS rulings and the Regulations in effect and as amended from time to time. 
 (b) Current Year Testing . The Plan shall utilize the current year testing method for purposes of the ADP test, as described in this subsection (b). Each Plan Year, the Actual Deferral Percentage of eligible Highly Compensated Employees shall not exceed the greater of 
 (i) The Actual Deferral Percentage of all other Participants for the Plan Year, multiplied by 1.25 or 
 (ii) The lesser of the Actual Deferral Percentage of all other Participants for the Plan Year multiplied by two (2), or the Actual Deferral Percentage of all other Participants for the Plan Year plus two (2) percentage points. 
 For any subsequent Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may elect to use the prior Plan Year s Actual Deferral Percentage for Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees in applying the tests described in this subsection (b). Such election shall be made in accordance with Section 401(k)(3)(A) of the Code and applicable Regulations and IRS rulings. 
 (c) Definitions and Special Rules . For the purposes of this Section 3.2, the following definitions and special rules apply 
 (i) Actual Deferral Percentage (or ratio means, for a specified group of Participants for a Plan Year, the average of the ratios (calculated separately for each Participants in such group) of (i) the amount of Company contributions (as described below) actually paid over to the Trust on behalf of such Participants for the Plan Year to (ii) the Participant s Code Section 415 Compensation for such Plan Year. Company contributions on behalf of any Participants shall include (1) any elective deferrals made pursuant to the Participant s deferral election (including excess elective deferrals of Highly Compensated Employees), but excluding (a) excess elective deferrals of Non-Highly Compensated Employees that arise solely from elective 
 13 

deferrals made under the Plan or plans of this employer and (b) elective deferrals that are taken into account in the 
 contribution percentage test (provided the ADP Test is satisfied both with and without exclusion of these elective deferrals) and (2) qualified non-elective contributions and qualified matching contributions as elected by the Plan Administrator. 
 (ii) The Actual Deferral Percentage for any Participants who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have elective deferrals (and qualified non-elective contributions or qualified matching contributions, or both, if treated as elective deferrals for purposes of the ADP Test) allocated to the Participant s Accounts under two or more arrangements described in Section 401(k) of the Code, that are maintained by a Company, shall be determined as if such elective deferrals (and, if applicable, such qualified non-elective contributions or qualified matching contributions, or both) were made under a single arrangement. If a Highly Compensated Employee participates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements of the Company that have different Plan Years, all elective deferrals made during the Plan Year under all such arrangements shall be aggregated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain plans shall be treated as separate if mandatorily disaggregated under Section 401(k) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. 
 (iii) In the event that the Plan satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) of the Code only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such sections of the Code only if aggregated with the Plan, then this section shall be applied by determining the Actual Deferral Percentage of Participants as if all such plans were a single plan. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Section 401(k) of the Code only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same Actual Deferral Percentage testing method. 
 (iv) To the extent not otherwise expressly provided for in this Section 3.2, the provisions of Sections 401(k)(3) and 401(m)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(k)-2 and 1.401(m)- 2 of the Regulations, and any related regulatory guidance, (and any subsequent IRS guidance issued under the above Sections of the Code) are, to the extent applicable, incorporated by reference. 
 (v) A separate deferral percentage test will be performed for collectively bargained employees in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory rules. 
 (d) Adjustments to Deferral Percentages . If at any time the Plan Administrator determines that there is a reasonable possibility that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section 3.2 will not be satisfied for a Plan Year, then the Plan Administrator shall direct the Company to decrease the salary reduction contribution rate of Highly Compensated Employees in order to ensure that such requirements will be satisfied. Such decreases shall be made in a manner generally consistent with the procedures required for the return of excess salary reduction contributions under Section 401(k)(8) of the Code and shall be made with respect to Tax Deferred Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions as elected by the Participant, or if the Participant makes no election, by the Company. 
 (e) Distribution of Excess Contributions . Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, excess contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, shall be distributed no later than the last day of each Plan Year to Participants to whose Accounts such excess contributions were allocated for the preceding Plan Year. If such excess amounts are distributed more than two and a half (2) months after the last day of the Plan Year in which such excess amounts arose, a ten percent (10 excise tax will be imposed on the applicable Employer with respect to such amounts. Excess contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest amounts of Company contributions taken into account in calculating the ADP Test for the year in which the excess arose, beginning with the Highly Compensated Employee with the largest amount of such Company contributions and continuing in 
 descending order until all the excess contributions have been allocated. The amount of excess contributions to be distributed with respect to a Participant for a Plan Year shall be reduced by any excess deferrals previously distributed to 
 14 

the Participant for the Participant s taxable year ending with or within the Plan Year in accordance with Section 402(g)(2) of the Code and Section 3.2. Excess contributions shall be treated as Annual Additions under the plan. In no case shall the amount of excess contributions to be distributed for a Plan Year with respect to any Highly Compensated Employee exceed the elective contributions made on behalf of such Participant for the Plan Year. Excess contributions shall mean, with respect to any Plan Year, the excess of (i) the aggregate amount of Company contributions actually taken into account in computing the Actual Deferral Percentage of Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year, over (ii) the maximum amount of such contributions permitted by the ADP Test (determined by hypothetically reducing contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees in order of their deferral percentages, beginning with the highest of such percentages). In the event a Highly Compensated Employee participates in more than one plan of the Company, the determination of which Highly Compensated Employee will be apportioned a share of any total excess contributions shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 401(k)-2(b)(2)(iii)(B) of the Regulations. Excess contributions will be distributed first from a Participant s Roth 401(k) Contributions Account, and then from a Participant s Tax Deferred Contributions Account. 
 (f) Allocable Income or Loss . The income or loss allocable to the excess contributions shall be the sum of the income or loss allocable to the excess contributions for the applicable year. Any reasonable method may be used for computing income allocable to excess contributions, provided that the method (i) does not violate Section 401(a)(4) of the Code, (ii) is consistently used for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and (iii) is used by the Plan for allocating income to Participants Accounts. 
 (g) Treatment of Matching Contributions . Matching Contributions shall not be allocated with respect to excess contributions that are distributable or that have been distributed under this Section 4.4. If any such allocation is made, the allocation shall be forfeited and reallocated as a matching Company contribution as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. 
 3.3 Taxed Contributions . 
 (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, an Active Participant may elect to contribute Taxed Contributions to the trust fund by authorizing monthly payroll deductions of from 1 to 80 (in whole integers) of his Compensation. An Active Participant s Taxed Contributions may not exceed the difference between (i) 80 of his Compensation and (ii) the percentage of his Compensation contributed as a Tax Deferred Contribution and Roth 401(k) Contribution. At any time, the Administrative Committee may reduce the rate of future Taxed Contributions to be made by Highly Compensated Employees in order to satisfy the test described in Section 3.5. If the Compensation of an Active Participant is changed, the dollar amount of his Taxed Contributions will automatically be changed so that the percentage elected is not changed. In the event an Active Participant s Tax Deferred Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions are limited as provided in Section 3.1(b) due to Section 402(g) of the Code, and such Active Participant is not contributing Taxed Contributions at such time, Taxed Contributions shall be made to the Active Participant s Account for the remainder of the Plan Year (subject to other applicable Plan provisions) at the same percentage that was in place at such time for the Tax Deferred Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions. 
 (b) An Active Participant may elect to completely suspend such contributions or to change the percentage of his Taxed Contributions. Such election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Administrative Committee shall determine, and shall be effective only in accordance with such rules as shall be established from time to time by the Administrative Committee. 
 (c) Taxed Contributions for any month will be paid by the Active Participant s Participating Employer to the trust fund as soon as feasible after the end of each pay period but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days following the end of the month with respect to which such amounts are withheld. 
 3.4 Employer Contributions . 
 (a) Matching Contributions . 
 15 

(i) Required Matching Contributions. Each Participating Employer shall contribute an amount sufficient to provide the allocations described in Section 5.3(a) and 5.4 with respect to its eligible Active Participants. Such contributions shall be made in cash, provided, however, that the Company may still make such contribution in Company Stock for those Participants who elect to invest in the Olin Common Stock Fund. Such contributions shall not be made on behalf of collectively bargained Employees, unless otherwise provided pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. 
 (ii) Additional Discretionary Matching Contributions. With respect to a Plan Year and subject to the applicable Code limits, each Participating Employer may make such additional discretionary Matching Contributions for the benefit of its Active Participants, in cash, (provided, however, that the Company may make such contributions in Company Stock for those Participants who elect to invest in the Olin Common Stock Fund) as the Company shall, in its discretion determine, with such contribution being allocated to its Active Participants in the same manner as the Matching Contributions provided for in Section 5.3(a). Such contributions shall not be made on behalf of collectively bargained Employees unless otherwise provided pursuant to collective bargaining. 
 (b) Retirement Contributions. Each Participating Employer shall contribute an amount sufficient to provide the allocations described in Section 5.4 with respect to its eligible Employees. These Retirement Contributions shall be allocated to such eligible Employees in accordance with the formula set forth in Section 5.4, regardless of whether they are otherwise Participants under the Plan immediately prior to such time. Such contributions shall be made in cash, provided, however, that the Company may still make such contribution in Company Stock for those Participants who elect to invest in the Olin Common Stock Fund. 
 3.5 Limitations on Taxed Contributions and Company Contributions . 
 (a) Contribution Percentage Test . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall meet the non-discrimination test of Section 401(m) of the Code ACP Test and Section 1.401(m)-2(a) of the Regulations for each Plan Year. The Plan Administrator shall administer the ACP test in accordance with IRS rulings and the Regulations in effect from time to time. 
 (b) Current Year Testing . The Plan shall utilize the current year testing method for purposes of the ACP test, as described in this subsection (b). Each Plan Year, the Actual Contribution Percentage (defined below) of the eligible Highly Compensated Employees shall not exceed the greater of 
 (i) The Actual Contribution Percentage of all other Participants for the Plan Year, multiplied by 1.25 or 
 (ii) The lesser of the Actual Contribution Percentage of all other Participants for the Plan Year multiplied by two (2,) or the Actual Contribution Percentage of all other Participants for the Plan Year plus two (2) percentage points. 
 For any subsequent Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may elect to use the prior Plan Year s Contribution Percentage for Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees in applying the tests described in this subsection (a). Such election shall be made in accordance with Section 401(m)(2)(A) of the Code and applicable Regulations and IRS rulings. 
 (c) Definitions and Special Rules . For the purposes of this Section 3.5, the following definitions and special rules apply 
 (i) Actual Contribution Percentage (or ratio means, for a specified group of Participants for a Plan Year, the average of the ratios (calculated separately for each Participant in such group) of each such Participant s contribution percentage amounts to the Participant s Code Section 415 Compensation for the Plan Year. Contribution percentage amounts means the sum of the Participant contributions, matching contributions, and qualified matching contributions (to the extent not taken into account for purposes of the ADP 
 16 

Test) made under the Plan on behalf of the Participant for the Plan Year. Such contribution percentage amounts shall not include matching contributions that are forfeited either to correct excess aggregate contributions or because the contributions to which they relate are excess deferrals, excess contributions, or excess aggregate contributions. The Plan Administrator may include qualified non-elective contributions in the contribution percentage amounts. Subject to Section 1.401(m)- 2(a)(6) of the Regulations, which is incorporated herein by reference, the Plan Administrator also may elect to use elective deferrals in the contribution percentage amounts. 
 (ii) Participant contribution shall mean any contribution (other than a Roth 401(k) Contribution) made to the Plan by or on behalf of a Participant that is included in the Participant s gross income in the year in which made and that is maintained under a separate account to which earnings and losses are allocated. 
 (iii) Matching contribution shall mean a Company contribution made to this or any other defined contribution plan on behalf of a Participant on account of a Participant contribution made by such Participant, or on account of a Participant s elective deferral, under a plan maintained by the Company. 
 (iv) Eligible participant means any Participant who is authorized under the Plan, for the Plan Year, to make a Participant contribution, or an elective deferral (if the Plan takes such contributions into account in the calculation of the contribution percentage), or to receive a matching contribution (including forfeitures) or a qualified matching contribution. If a Participant contribution is required as a condition of participation in the Plan, any Employee who would be a Participant but for the failure to make such a contribution shall be treated as an Eligible participant on whose behalf no employee contributions are made. 
 (v) For purposes of this Section 3.5, the contribution percentage for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee and who is eligible to have contribution percentage amounts allocated to the Participant s account under two or more plans described in Section 401(a) of the Code, or arrangements described in Section 401(k) of the Code that are maintained by the Employer, shall be determined as if the total of such contribution percentage amounts was made under each plan and arrangement. If a Highly Compensated Employee participates in two or more such plans or arrangements that have different Plan Years, all 
 contribution percentage amounts made during the Plan Year under all such plans and arrangements shall be aggregated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain plans shall be treated as separate if mandatorily disaggregated under Regulations under Section 401(m) of the Code. 
 (vi) In the event that the Plan satisfies the requirements of Sections 401(m), 401(a)(4) or 410(b) of the Code only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such sections of the Code only if aggregated with the Plan, then this section shall be applied by determining the actual contribution percentage of Employees as if all such plans were a single plan. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Section 401(m) of the Code only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same contribution percentage testing method. 
 (vii) For purposes of this Section 3.5, Participant contributions are considered to have been made in the Plan Year in which contributed to the Trust. Matching contributions and qualified non-elective contributions will be considered made for a Plan Year if made no later than the end of the 12-month period beginning on the day after the close of the Plan Year. 
 (viii) The Plan shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate satisfaction of the contribution percentage test and the amount of qualified non-elective contributions or qualified matching contributions, or both, used in such test. 
 (ix) A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if the Participant meets the definition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a Non-Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if the Participant does not meet the definition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year. 
 17 

(x) To the extent not otherwise expressly provided for in this Section 3.5, the provisions of Sections 401(m)(2) and 401(m)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(m)-1(b) and 1.401(m)-2 of the Regulations (and any subsequent IRS guidance issued under the above Sections of the Code) are, to the extent applicable, incorporated by reference. 
 (d) Distribution of Excess Aggregate Contributions . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, excess aggregate contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, shall be forfeited, if forfeitable, or if not forfeitable, distributed no later than the last day of each Plan Year to participants to whose accounts such excess aggregate contributions were allocated for the preceding Plan Year. If such excess amounts are distributed more than 2 months after the last day of the Plan Year in which such excess amounts arose, a ten percent (10 excise tax will be imposed on the applicable Employer with respect to such amounts. Excess aggregate contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest contribution percentage amounts taken into account in calculating the ACP Test for the year in which the excess arose, beginning with the Highly Compensated Employee with the largest amount of such contribution percentage amounts and continuing in descending order until all the excess aggregate contributions have been allocated. Excess aggregate contributions shall be treated as Annual Additions under the plan. In no case shall the amount of excess aggregate contributions to be distributed for a Plan Year with respect to any Highly Compensated Employee exceed the amount of contribution percentage amounts made on behalf of such Participant for the Plan Year. Excess aggregate contributions shall mean, with respect to any Plan Year, the excess of (i) the aggregate contribution percentage amounts taken into account in computing the numerator of the contribution percentage actually made on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year, over (ii) the maximum contribution percentage amounts permitted by the contribution percentage test (determined by hypothetically reducing contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees in order of their contribution percentages, 
 beginning with the highest of such percentages). In the event a Highly Compensated Employee participates in more than one plan of the Company, the determination of which Highly Compensated Employee will be apportioned a share of any total excess aggregate contributions will be made in a manner consistent with Section 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(iii)(B) of the Regulations. 
 (e) Allocable Income or Loss . The income or loss allocable to the excess aggregate contributions shall be the sum of the income or loss allocable to the excess aggregate contributions for the applicable year. For corrective distributions made with respect to Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2008, the income and loss allocable to a Participant s excess aggregate contributions that are distributed pursuant to this Section 3.5 for the gap period between the end of the Plan Year and the date of such distribution will be determined in accordance with applicable Regulations. For corrective distributions made with respect to Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2008, no such gap period income or loss will be allocated. Any reasonable method may be used for computing income allocable to excess aggregate contributions, provided that the method (i) does not violate Section 401(a)(4) of the Code, (ii) is consistently used for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and 
 (iii) is used by the Plan for allocating income to participants accounts. 
 3.6 Rollover Contributions and Prior Plan Transfers . 
 Subject to the prior approval of the Administrative Committee (and in accordance with Appendix A with respect to the Dow Savings Plan), the Plan may receive Rollover Contributions representing all or part of the entire amount of any distribution from a qualified retirement plan meeting the requirements of Sections 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code on behalf of all Eligible Employees, provided that 
 (a) prior to January 1, 2002, no part of any distribution that is attributable to after-tax contributions may be rolled over to this Plan 
 (b) no part of any hardship distribution may be rolled over to this Plan 
 (c) no distribution that is made to comply with the minimum required distribution rules of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code may be rolled to this Plan and 
 18 

(d) no distribution that one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the life (or life expectancy) of the Active Participant or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Active Participant and his designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more may be rolled over to this Plan. 
 On or after January 1, 2002, the Plan may accept Rollover Contributions attributable to after-tax contributions provided that such rollover is made through a direct trustee-to-trustee rollover from a qualified plan described in Sections 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code. Rollover Contributions received by the Plan which are attributable to after-tax employee contributions shall be separately accounted for, including separately accounting for the portion of such Rollover Contribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such Rollover Contribution which is not so includable. On or after February 1, 2009, the Plan may accept Rollover Contributions attributable to another Roth elective deferral account under an applicable retirement plan described in Section 402A(e)(1) of the Code but only to the extent the rollover is permitted under the rules of Section 402(c) of the Code, and provided that such rollover is made through a direct trustee-to-trustee rollover. 
 Except as otherwise required above, any rollover may be made (i) through a direct rollover from a qualified plan, to this Plan, or (ii) through a distribution and rollover deposited in this Plan no later than the 
 sixtieth (60th) day after the distribution was received by the Active Participant from the distributing plan or from a conduit IRA. 
 Subject to the approval of the Administrative Committee, amounts may be transferred directly to the Plan from a plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code provided that such plan is not either a defined benefit plan described in Section 414(j) of the Code or a defined contribution plan described in Section 414(i) of the Code that is subject to the minimum funding standards contained in Section 412 of the Code. All such Rollover Contributions or prior plan transfers shall be credited to the Active Participant s Rollover Contribution Account, with such separate accounting under a sub-account as required by applicable law or the Administrative Committee. All such contributions and transfers shall become vested and distributable in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
 With respect to a determination that the distributing plan meets the requirements of Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, evidence that the distributing plan has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service shall not be necessary for the Administrative Committee to reach the conclusion, in good faith, that such Rollover Contributions appear to be valid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Committee later determines that the contribution was an invalid rollover contribution, the amount of the invalid rollover contribution, plus any earnings attributable thereto, shall be distributed to the Participant within a reasonable time after such determination. 
 For any transfer or rollover, and at the direction of the Administrative Committee and in accordance with such rules as the Administrative Committee may establish from time to time, the Plan will only accept cash on behalf of a Participant. 
 3.7 Benefit and Contribution Limitations . 
 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the sum of the annual additions (as hereinafter defined) to a Participant s Account for limitation year (which shall be the calendar year) shall not exceed the lesser of 
 (i) 40,000 (as adjusted for increases in the cost of living under Section 415(d) 
 of the Code), or 
 (ii) One hundred percent (100 of the Participant s compensation (as defined in Section 415(c)(3) of the Code) for such limitation year from all Affiliated Companies. 
 The adjusted limitation under Section 415(d) of the Code for the Plan Year beginning on the Restatement Effective Date is 69,000. 
 19 

For any short Plan Year, the dollar limitation in (i), above, shall be reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the short Plan Year and the denominator of which is twelve (12). For Limitation Years beginning on or after January 1, 1998, Compensation under Section 415(c)(3) of the Code Code Section 415 Compensation shall include any elective deferral as defined in Section 402(g)(3) of the Code and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the Company at the election of the Employee and which is not otherwise includable in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Sections 125 or 457 of the Code. For Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 1998, such elective deferrals are not included in Code Section 415 Compensation. For Limitation Years beginning on or after January 1, 1998, Code Section 415 Compensation shall include salary reduction amounts deemed contributed under Section 125 of the Code because the Employee is unable (or fails) to certify that he has other health insurance coverage and, thus, is unable to elect unreduced salary instead of health insurance benefits, but only if the Company relies on employee certifications of coverage and does not otherwise 
 request or collect information regarding the Employee s other health coverage as part of the enrollment process for the health plan. For Limitation Years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, Code Section 415 Compensation shall include elective amounts that are not includible in gross income of the employee by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Code. Code Section 415 Compensation shall include regular compensation for services that is paid after a Participant s severance from employment to the extent such compensation is made within the time limits prescribed by Code Section 415 and such amounts would have been included as Code Section 415 Compensation if paid prior to the Participant s severance from employment. 
 (b) Annual additions to a Participant s Account for a Plan Year shall be the sum of 
 (i) the Participant s Tax Deferred Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions for such Plan Year, except to the extent exempted as catch-up contributions in accordance with Section 414(v) of the Code 
 (ii) for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1986, the Participant s Taxed Contributions for such Plan Year 
 (iii) the employer contributions allocated to the Participant s Account (including, but not limited to, Company Contributions) 
 (iv) forfeitures allocated to the Participant s Account 
 (v) amounts allocated, after March 31, 1984, to an individual medical account, as defined in Section 415(l)(2) of the Code which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by a Participating Employer and 
 (vi) amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after December 31, 1985 in taxable years ending after such date, are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits allocated to the separate account of a key employee (as defined in Section 419A(d)(3) of the Code) under a welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) maintained by a Participating Employer 
 provided, however, that the percentage of compensation limitations referred to in (a), above, shall not apply to any contribution for medical benefits (within the meaning of Section 419A(f)(2) of the Code) after separation from service which is otherwise treated as an annual addition or to any amount otherwise treated as an annual addition under Section 415(l)(1) of the Code. 
 (c) Annual additions to a Participant s Account for a Plan Year shall not include 
 (i) transfers or rollover contributions 
 (ii) Participant repayments of a plan loan, a cash-out distribution or of a distribution of mandatory contributions (within the meaning of Section 411(a)(3)(D) of the Code) or 
 20 

(iii) employee contributions to a simplified employee pension excludable from gross income under Section 408(k)(6) of the Code. 
 (d) In the event that it is determined that the annual additions to a Participant s Account for any Plan Year would be in excess of the limitations contained herein, such annual additions 
 shall be reduced to the extent necessary to bring such annual additions within the limitations contained in this Section 3.7. Likewise, for any Limitation Year beginning before January 1, 2000, in the event that any Participant of the Plan is also a Participant in any defined benefit plan or plans maintained by an Affiliated Company and it is determined that the annual additions to a Participant s Account for any Plan Year when considered with the Participant s projected annual benefit under such defined benefit plan or plans would be in excess of the limitations contained in Section 3.7 hereof, such annual additions and benefits shall be reduced to the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations contained in Section 3.7. In general, the required reductions in annual additions and benefits shall be made by proceeding only as far as necessary through the following sequence, with reductions at each level being prorated among all affected plans making provision for such reductions 
 (i) return of Taxed Contributions, plus any earnings thereon, if any, to the extent they are treated as annual additions 
 (ii) return of Tax Deferred Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions, plus any earnings thereon, if any, to the extent they are treated as annual additions 
 (iii) reduction of defined contribution plan annual additions other than Taxed Contributions and Tax-Deferred Contributions. 
 The Administrative Committee is authorized in its discretion to utilize a different method of correction provided such method is consistent with the requirements of the Code and Regulations thereunder and is applied on a uniform and non-discriminatory manner to all affected Participants. 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the application of the limitations and requirements under Section 415 of the Code for limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007 shall be made in accordance with the applicable final Regulations published in April 2007 with respect to applying such limitations and requirements. 
 3.8 Roth 401(k) Contributions . 
 (a) As of February 1, 2009, the Plan will accept Roth 401(k) Contributions made on behalf of Active Participants which will be allocated to the Roth 401(k) Contribution Account. Unless specifically stated otherwise, Roth 401(k) Contributions will be treated as Tax Deferred Contributions for all purposes under the Plan in accordance with applicable law and as required by the context of the Plan. Additionally, Roth 401(k) Contributions shall not be made under any automatic enrollment provisions of the Plan. Roth 401(k) Contributions, earnings, distributions and withdrawals will be taxed in accordance with applicable law. 
 (b) Subject to the preceding provisions of this Article III, an Active Participant may elect to contribute Roth 401(k) Contributions to the trust fund by authorizing monthly payroll deductions of from 1 to 80 (in whole integers) of his Compensation. An Active Participant s Roth 401(k) Contributions may not exceed the difference between (i) 80 of his Compensation and (ii) the percentage of his Compensation contributed as a Tax Deferred Contributions and Taxed Contributions. At any time, the Administrative Committee may reduce the rate of future Roth 401(k) Contributions to be made by Highly Compensated Employees in order to satisfy the preceding provisions of this Article III. If the Compensation of an Active Participant is changed, the dollar amount of his Roth 401(k) Contributions will automatically be changed so that the percentage elected is not changed. 
 (c) An Active Participant may elect to completely suspend such contributions or to change the percentage of his Roth 401(k) Contributions. Such election shall be made at such time and in 
 21 

such manner as the Administrative Committee shall determine, and shall be effective only in accordance with such rules as shall be established from time to time by the Administrative Committee. 
 (d) Roth 401(k) Contributions for any month will be paid by the Active Participant s Participating Employer to the trust fund as soon as feasible after the end of each pay period but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days following the end of the month with respect to which such amounts are withheld. 
 (e) In all cases and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Matching Contributions will be applied to Tax Deferred Contributions first, then Roth 401(k) Contributions and then Taxed Contributions. Except as otherwise provided herein, Catch-Up Contributions attributable to Roth 401(k) Contributions will not be eligible for Matching Contributions. 
 (f) In the case of a distribution of Excess Contributions for a Highly Compensated Employee, the Administrative Committee will determine the extent to which the excess amount is composed of Tax Deferred Contributions and or Roth 401(k) Contributions but only to the extent such types of contribution were made for the year. 
 (g) A Roth 401(k) Contribution is an elective deferral that is (i) designated irrevocably by the Participant at the time of the cash or deferred election as a Roth elective deferral that is being made in lieu of all or a portion of the pre-tax elective deferrals the Participant is otherwise eligible to make under the Plan and (ii) treated by the Company as includible in the Participant s income at the time the Participant would have received that amount in cash if the Participant had not made a cash or deferred election. 
 3.9 Qualified Separate Lines of Business . To the extent determined by the Administrative Committee for any Plan Year, the Plan may operate with individual qualified separate lines of business QSLOBs ). In such case for such Plan Years, the Plan testing described in Sections 3.2 and 3.5 (and the determinations of Actual Contribution Percentage and Actual Deferral Percentage) and any other applicable Plan testing requirements, the Plan testing for such Plan Years shall be determined separately with respect to the designated QSLOBs, and the Plan provisions contained herein shall be construed and administered accordingly. For avoidance of doubt, with respect to Plan Years beginning after 2017 (regardless of whether QSLOBs are designated or not designated for a particular Plan Year), this Plan is intended to be a safe harbor plan (via the non-elective contribution approach) as described in Section 401(k)(12) of the Code for all Non-Bargaining Unit Employees (excluding Employees at the LCAAP (as defined in Appendix A)). 
 3.10 In-Plan Roth Transfer . In-plan Roth transfers (as described in this Section 3.10) are added to the Plan effective January 1, 2025. An in-plan Roth transfer means the transfer of amounts from a Taxed Contributions Account of the Participant to an in-plan transfer Account. An in-plan Roth transfer can be made from a Taxed Contributions Account in which the Participant is 100 vested. An in-plan Roth transfer can be made at any time and will apply as soon as administratively feasible. Regardless of any spousal consent requirements set forth in the Plan, spousal consent is not required in connection with any in-plan Roth transfers. An in-plan Roth transfer is irrevocable and irreversible and cannot be undone or recharacterized in any manner. An in-plan Roth transfer will be taken into account in determining any cash- out threshold or other restrictions on immediate distributions. The Administrative Committee will establish rules and procedures with respect to in-plan Roth transfers which will be applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. The Plan will maintain such records as are necessary for the proper reporting of in-plan Roth transfers. Participants may elect in-plan Roth transfers. Both a surviving Spouse Beneficiary, and an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order who is either a Spouse or former Spouse may also elect an in-plan Roth transfer. 
 ARTICLE IV 
 ESOP LOANS 
 4.1 Limitations on Stock Acquired with Proceeds of an ESOP Loan . The provisions of this Article IV shall apply solely to that portion of the Plan which is an ESOP within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Except as otherwise permitted in Sections 409(h) and (l) of the Code and Regulations promulgated thereunder, no Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an ESOP Loan shall be subject to any put, call, or other option or any buy sell or similar agreement while held by and when distributed from the trust fund, whether or not the Plan constitutes an 
 22 

employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code at such time and whether or not the ESOP Loan has been repaid at such time. 
 ARTICLE V 
 ALLOCATIONS TO PARTICIPANTS ACCOUNTS 
 5.1 Tax Deferred Contributions, Roth 401(k) Contributions and Taxed Contributions . Tax Deferred Contributions, Roth 401(k) Contributions and Taxed Contributions made on behalf of or by a Participant shall be allocated to his Tax Deferred Contribution Account, Roth 401(k) Contribution Account or Taxed Contribution Account, as appropriate, as soon as practicable after such contributions are transferred to the trust fund established under the Plan. 
 5.2 Allocations with Respect to Dividends on Allocated Company Stock . 
 (a) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, with respect to cash dividends paid on or after January 1, 2002 on Company Stock held in a Participant s ESOP Account, each Participant (or his Beneficiary) may elect, in accordance with uniform and non-discriminatory procedures adopted by the Administrative Committee and in accordance with Section 404(k) of the Code, to 
 (i) have such cash dividends directly paid to such Participant (or to his Beneficiary) as soon as administrative feasible following the payment of such cash dividend 
 (ii) be paid to the trust fund and distributed to the Participant (or to his Beneficiary) as soon as administrative feasible following the payment of such cash dividend but no later than 90 days after the end of the Plan Year in which the cash dividend is paid or 
 (iii) be paid to the Plan (in cash or Company Stock, as elected by the Company) and automatically reinvested in the Olin Common Stock Fund 
 (iv) Any such reinvestment election under (iii) shall be made and provided by the Company in accordance with IRS Notice 2002-2. On and after January 1, 2002, a Participant shall at all times be deemed vested in any cash dividends allocated to his ESOP Account, with respect to which he is offered the foregoing reinvestment election, whether or not he is then otherwise fully vested in his Account Balance under the terms of the Plan. 
 (b) In accordance with this Section 5.2, the Company shall be entitled to deduct the amount of the cash dividends (but not any earnings on such cash dividends earned while in the Plan) subject to such election in the taxable year in which the cash dividend is paid or distributed. 
 (c) No cash dividends paid or reinvested as provided for above shall be treated as annual additions under Section 415 of the Code, or as Tax Deferred Contributions, Roth 401(k) Contributions or Taxed Contributions subject to Sections 410(k), 402(g) or 401(m) of the Code. 
 (d) With respect to dividends paid on Company Stock that are not part of a Participant s ESOP Account or non-cash dividends paid on Company Stock held in the Participant s ESOP Account, such dividends will be reinvested in the same manner and percentages as the Participant s other Participant-Directed Investments (or as otherwise provided under the Plan). 
 5.3 Matching Contributions . 
 (a) Generally . 
 (i) Each Participating Employer shall allocate to eligible Active Participants from contributions sufficient to provide each such Participant with a Matching Contribution equal to such amounts as determined below. The Company may elect to provide a different rate of Matching Contribution or no Matching 
 23 

Contribution for any group of Active Participants, provided however that a decrease in the rate of Matching Contributions may be made effective only prospectively following approval of such decrease by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Plan s Matching Contribution provisions below in Section 5.3(b) shall not be applicable with respect to Bargaining Unit Employees unless otherwise provided in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. 
 (ii) In no event will any Tax Deferred Contributions, Roth 401(k) Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions or Taxed Contributions be matched at greater than a 100 rate. 
 (iii) In the event that a Participant s matched Tax Deferred Contributions, Roth 401(k) Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions or Taxed Contributions are distributed or returned to the Participant pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5, an amount equal to the Current Market Value of the related Matching Contribution (and earnings thereon) shall be forfeited by such Participant. 
 (iv) Matching Contributions shall be invested in the same manner and percentages as the Participant s other Participant-Directed Investments. 
 (b) Non-Bargaining Unit Employee Participants .

 INVESTMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS 
 6.1 Participant Direction of Accounts . The Administrative Committee is authorized and directed to maintain a program, to be administered in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner, whereby a Participant (or Beneficiary) may direct the investment of the Participant s Account. By virtue of such Participant directed investments, the Plan is intended to constitute a plan described in Section 404(c) of ERISA and the Regulations issued thereunder. As such, to the extent permitted by law, the Trustee, the Administrative Committee, the Investment Committee, the Company, any Participating Employer, or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be relieved of liability for any losses which are the direct and necessary result of investment instructions given or deemed given by a Participant (or Beneficiary). A Participant (or Beneficiary) shall not be deemed to be a plan fiduciary, however, by reason of the exercise of control over the investment of his Account except as otherwise provided in the Plan. 
 Participant (or Beneficiary) investment direction over Accounts shall be subject to such rules and Regulations as to the timing and frequency of investment changes, transfers between Funds, limitations, allocations of expenses and other aspects of Plan administration as the Administrative Committee may from time to time establish in writing. Additionally, restrictions may be imposed on the Accounts of certain Participants with Olin Common Stock Fund investments to comply with any securities laws or Company policies or Section 6.3. 
 The Investment Committee may change the types of Funds offered, may add, freeze or delete any particular Fund (including a self-directed brokerage window investment option), and may map investments between Funds (or from 
 28 

investment funds of merged plans into Funds). The decision to invest in any particular Fund (including a self- directed brokerage window investment option) offered under the Plan, however, is the sole responsibility of each Participant (or Beneficiary). To the extent a self-directed brokerage window investment option is available, each Participant (or Beneficiary) shall be the named fiduciary (as described in Section 402(a)(2) of ERISA) with respect to such self-directed brokerage 
 window investment option. The Trustee, the Administrative Committee, the Investment Committee, the Company, any Participating Employer, or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents are not empowered to advise a Participant (or Beneficiary) as to the manner in which his Account shall be invested. The fact that a security is available to Participants (or Beneficiaries) for investment under the Plan shall not be construed as a recommendation for the purchase of that security, nor shall the designation of any option impose any liability on the Company, any Participating Employer, its directors, officers, employees or agents, the Trustee, the Investment Committee or the Administrative Committee. 
 The Investment Committee in its discretion may engage investment managers to manage the Accounts of Participants (if so elected by Participants) upon such terms as agreed to by the Investment Committee and such investment managers.

For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Article VI are intended to satisfy Section 401(a)(28) of the Code and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (including, but not limited to, Section 401(a)(35) of the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder) by permitting immediate diversification for all units in the Olin Common Stock Fund acquired by the Account of a Participant. 
 6.2 Investments in Company Stock . Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, and subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, the Investment Committee shall maintain as a Fund the Olin Common Stock Fund. Subject to the limitations of Section 6.3, Participants (or Beneficiaries) may, but are not required to, invest some portion of their Tax Deferred Contributions, Roth 401(k) Contributions, Taxed Contributions, Rollover Contributions and Company Contributions in such Olin Common Stock Fund. For avoidance of doubt, Tax Deferred Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions shall include any Catch-Up Contributions, in accordance with Section 3.1(e). 
 The Trustee may purchase Company Stock directly from the Company or from any other source, including on the open market provided, however, that in no event shall a commission be charged with respect to a purchase of Company Stock from the Company. Such Company Stock may be treasury stock, authorized and previously unissued shares, or shares previously issued and repurchased by the Company, all valued at the Current Market Value of such Company Stock. Additions to and subtractions from the Olin Common Stock Fund may be netted for any given period. 
 Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the Trust Fund to the contrary, the Investment Committee shall appoint an entity to serve as the independent fiduciary and investment manager of the Olin Common Stock Fund, whereby such entity, in its discretion, may suspend future investment in the Olin Common Stock Fund or liquidate the Company Stock held in the Olin Common Stock Fund, in the event such entity determines that extreme circumstances have occurred such that there is a serious question regarding the Company s short-term viability as a going concern. 
 6.3 Limitations on Investing in the Olin Common Stock Fund .

 (c) Amounts allocated in the Olin Common Stock Fund shall not be subject to any automatic rebalancing feature under the Plan. 
 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to affect the operation of the provisions

Effective October 17, 2003, Matching Contributions invested in the Olin Common Stock Fund may be transferred to other Funds at the direction of the Participant (or Beneficiary). 
 6.5 Special Distribution Account . 
 (a) Generally . In the case of a distribution of stock and or securities of a controlled corporation of the Company received on, or with respect to, the Company Stock as part of a spin off, split off, split up or other similar reorganization resulting in a corporate separation, the Trustee will retain such stock and cause to be credited to a Special Distribution Account established for each Participant under the Olin Common Stock Fund his proportionate number of shares of such stock as determined by the Trustee on the basis of the number of shares of Company Stock in such Participant s account in the Olin Common Stock Fund on the record date of the distribution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Trustee, in its discretion, may sell such stock and or securities received on, or with respect to, the Company Stock held in the ESOP Account and reinvest, subject to other applicable provisions of the Plan, such proceeds in Company Stock for the Participants Olin Common Stock Fund accounts if the Trustee determines that it is necessary to do so in order to retain the status of the ESOP as an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. In any event, however, the Trustee shall sell all other securities received as part of such distribution, and reinvest, subject to other applicable provisions of the Plan, the proceeds thereof in Company Stock for the Participants Olin Common Stock Fund accounts. 
 (b) Subsequent Corporate Transactions with Respect to Shares Held in Special Distribution Account . In the event any securities of a previously controlled corporation of the Company credited to a Participant s Special Distribution Account shall thereafter, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other reorganization involving the previously controlled corporation, be changed into, or become exchangeable for, securities of another corporation and or cash, the Trustee will retain the securities of such other corporation and cause the same to be credited to such Special Distribution Account. If shareholders of the previously controlled corporation shall be offered an election by such other corporation as to the securities and or cash they may receive in such merger, consolidation or other reorganization, the Trustee will provide a similar election to each Participant, provided that if a Participant fails to exercise any such election afforded by the Trustee within the period of time required by the Trustee, then such election may be made by the Trustee on such basis as it deems appropriate. In the event securities in a Special Distribution Account shall be the subject of a tender offer for cash and or an exchange offer for securities 
 of another corporation, the Trustee may accept such tender or exchange offer with respect to a Participant only if the Trustee has been authorized to do so by such Participant within the period of time required by the Trustee. The Trustee will retain any securities of such other corporation received in an exchange offer and cause the same to be credited to such Special Distribution Account. In the event that the securities of such other corporation shall carry the right of conversion into other securities, such right may be exercised only at the election of the Participant and shall not be a 
 30 

responsibility of the Trustee. Upon any such conversion, such other securities shall be credited to the Participant s Special Distribution Account. All cash received by the Trustee in such merger, consolidation or other reorganization, or in such tender offer, or as a result of any securities received as part of such merger, consolidation or other reorganization and all dividends and other distributions on securities held in a Special Distribution Account, shall, except as stated above or elsewhere in the Plan, be invested in the Olin Common Stock Fund.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, provided that the employee s principal residence or principal place of employment at the time of the disaster was located in an area designated by FEMA for individual assistance with respect to the disaster or (viii) other extraordinary expenses as determined by the Administrative Committee. Hardship shall also include any other expenses determined to constitute an immediate and heavy need under the Regulations. 
 (c) A withdrawal shall not be deemed to be necessary to satisfy a Participant s immediate and heavy financial need unless (i) the withdrawal does not exceed the amount needed to satisfy the Participant s immediate financial need created by the hardship (including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the hardship withdrawal) (ii) the Participant has obtained all available distributions and discretionary withdrawals (excluding hardship distributions) under this Plan and all other plans maintained by an Affiliated Company and (iii) for hardship withdrawals made prior to January 1, 2002 only, when Tax Deferred Contributions resume, the maximum dollar amount of the Participant s Tax Deferred Contributions shall be the applicable dol1ar amount specified in Code Section 402(g) reduced by the amount of such Participant s Tax Deferred Contribution for the taxable year in which the hardship withdrawal occurred. Additionally, in order to be deemed necessary to satisfy a Participant s immediate and heavy financial need, the Participant shall provide a representation in such form prescribed by the Administrative Committee that he or she has insufficient cash or other liquid assets reasonably available to satisfy the need, and the Administrative Committee shall not have actual knowledge to the contrary. 
 (d) In-service hardship withdrawals pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be taken from available amounts in such Participant s Account in the following order of priority 
 (i) First, the principal amount of his unmatched Taxed Contributions and earnings attributable to unmatched Taxed Contributions. 
 (ii) Second, the principal amount of his matched Taxed Contributions and earnings attributable to matched Taxed Contributions 
 (iii) Third, amounts in his Company Contribution Account, to the extent vested provided, however, that no amount in his Company Contribution Account may be withdrawn by a Participant who has been a Participant for fewer than five years unless such amounts are attributable to allocations made more than two years before the date of the withdrawal and further provided that no portion of a Retirement Contribution Account may be withdrawn prior to termination of service and 
 (iv) Fourth, all or any portion of his Tax Deferred Contribution Account and Roth 401(k) Contribution Account. 
 34 

No withdrawal may be made under any subsection above unless all amounts that may be withdrawn under all preceding subsections have been withdrawn. The amount to be withdrawn shall be based on the Current Market Value of the investment as of the applicable Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of the distribution. Such distribution shall be made in cash provided, however, that a withdrawal from a Participant s ESOP Account may be paid in shares of Company Stock if so elected by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Plan receives written notice of a contemplated divorce or QDRO or receives a domestic relations order, no withdrawals shall be permitted from the Participant s account except as provided in Section 10.6. 
 8.7 Limitation on Withdrawals for Participants with Outstanding Loans . A Participant with an outstanding loan pursuant to Article IX may request a withdrawal pursuant to this Article VIII. 
 
 ARTICLE IX 
 LOANS TO PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES 
 9.1 Loan Program . The Administrative Committee is authorized in its sole discretion to establish and maintain a loan program in accordance with Section 408(b)(1) of ERISA and related Regulations and consistent with the provisions of this Article IX. Only Eligible Employees and Active Participants (i.e., an individual who is a Party in Interest as defined in Section (3)(14) of ERISA, hereinafter collectively referred to as Eligible Borrowers shall be eligible to participate in the loan program. Loans shall be processed and made in accordance with rules and procedures from time to time adopted by the Administrative Committee in its discretion. Such rules and procedures shall be in a written document and are incorporated herein by reference. 
 9.2 General Rules . Any Eligible Borrower with a vested interest in an Account Balance under the Plan may make an application to the Administrative Committee (or its delegate) for a loan. Loan applications shall be approved or denied by the Administrative Committee (or its delegate) within a reasonable period of time after receipt. Loans shall be made available to all Eligible Borrowers on a uniform and reasonably equivalent basis, without regard to an individual s race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. In reviewing a loan application, only those factors which would be considered in a normal commercial setting by an entity in the business of making similar types of loans may be considered. Such factors may include the Eligible Borrower s creditworthiness and financial need. If approved, the 
 Administrative Committee (or its delegate) shall direct the Trustee to make a loan to the Eligible Borrower. Any loan made to an Eligible Borrower shall be treated as a segregated investment of a portion of the Eligible Borrower s Account Balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Plan receives written notice of a contemplated divorce or QDRO or receives a domestic relations order, no loans shall be permitted from the Participant s Account except as provided in Section 10.6(c). 
 9.3 Amount . Loans shall be made in amounts approved by the Administrative Committee in its discretion. No loan shall be for less than Five Hundred Dollars 500). A Participant may have only one loan outstanding at any given time. However, the loans that a Participant has as of August 15, 2012 will continue to remain in effect and subject to the original terms. A Participant may not request an additional loan until all loans outstanding on August 15, 2012 are repaid. No loan when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans from the Plan to the Eligible Borrower shall exceed the lesser of 
 (a) fifty Thousand Dollars 50,000), reduced by the excess (if any) of (i) the highest outstanding balance of loans from the Plan to the Eligible Borrower during the one-year period ending on the day before the date the loan is made, over (ii) the outstanding balance of loans from the Plan to the Eligible Borrower on the date the loan is made, or 
 (b) one-half (1 2) of the Eligible Borrower s vested Account Balance as of the valuation date coincident with or immediately preceding the date of the loan. 
 35 

Any loans transferred to the Plan from any qualified defined contribution pension plan merged into this Plan (including, without limitation, the KA Steel Plans (as defined in Appendix A)) shall count toward the limits on loans specified herein. In addition, for any loans so transferred to the Plan from a merged plan, the name of the Plan shall be deemed substituted for the name of the merged plan on any applicable loan notes and all other loan note terms shall remain the same. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Administrative Committee may allow additional loans beyond the above maximum with respect to any merged plan (including, without limitation, the KA Steel Plans) or any group of Participants employed at a business that is acquired by the Company and specifically permitted participation herein provided that the Administrative Committee determines that such additional loans are administratively feasible and such action is taken solely to accommodate prior loans under any merged plan or plans affected by such business acquisition. 
 9.4 Rate of Interest and Term of Loan . All loans shall be considered a segregated investment of the Trust Fund and shall bear a reasonable rate of interest to be determined by the Administrative Committee taking into consideration the interest rates being charged by regional and local banks, the prevailing prime rate and general economic conditions. The interest rate shall not exceed the maximum rate allowed by state or federal law provided, however, that the Administrative Committee shall have no obligation to make loans during any period in which the maximum rate allowed by state or federal law would not permit the loan to bear a reasonable rate of interest in light of the prevailing economic circumstances. All loans shall be for a maximum of five (5) years or for such shorter term as the Administrative Committee may determine. 
 9.5 Security . All loans shall be secured by the pledge of the Eligible Borrower s vested Account Balance under the Plan and may be further secured by additional collateral acceptable to the Administrative Committee if the Administrative Committee determines, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, that such additional collateral is necessary or desirable to ensure repayment of the loan. No more than fifty percent (50 of an Eligible Borrower s Vested Account Balance determined as of the valuation date coincident with or immediately preceding the date of the loan may be used to secure a loan. In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and the attachment of the Plan s security interest in an Account Balance will not occur until a distributable event occurs under the Plan. 
 9.6 Repayment . All loans shall provide for substantially level amortization over the term of the loan, with payments of principal and interest paid through automatic payroll deductions provided, however, that the Eligible Borrower may prepay the loan in full at any time without penalty and the Eligible Borrower shall be required to make repayment in full upon the Eligible Borrower s termination of employment. Notwithstanding the preceding, an Eligible Borrower shall be permitted to continue to make payments on an existing loan after termination of employment in accordance with and subject to the rules set by the Administrative Committee. 
 To the extent permitted by law, repayments will be suspended during an unpaid Company approved leave of absence or layoffs of up to one year although interest will continue to accrue during these periods of suspension. Upon the Participant s return to employment, the accrued interest will be added to his outstanding loan balance and the individual s repayment schedule will be adjusted provided, however, that the original term of the loan shall not be extended by virtue of such leave of absence. If a leave of absence or layoff exceeds one year, the outstanding loan balance will become immediately due and payable as of the end of the one year period. If an Eligible Borrower withdraws a portion or all of such individual s vested Account Balance or becomes entitled to payment of benefits under the Plan, such payments or withdrawals shall first be applied toward any outstanding loan balance (including accrued interest), with the excess, if any, paid directly to the individual. 
 ARTICLE X 
 DISTRIBUTIONS 
 10.1 Termination of Employment . 
 (a) If an Active Participant has a severance from employment (as such term is defined under Section 401(k) of the Code), or terminates employment on account of disability or death, upon filing an application therefor as prescribed by the Administrative Committee and subject to Section 9.6 hereof, the value of such Former Participant s Account, to the extent vested, shall be distributed to him, or if he is not living, to his Beneficiary, either in a lump sum, in 
 36 

installments, in a partial periodic payments, or in an alternate method (as permitted under Section 3.6) as the Participant (or his Beneficiary) has elected provided, however, that the Administrative Committee shall direct the Trustee to distribute, in a lump sum, the Participant s entire Account as soon as practicable following his termination of employment if the value of the vested portion of the Participant s Account does not exceed 7,000. If the value of the vested portion of a Participant s Account exceeds the applicable small lump sum benefit amount (as provided in the preceding sentence), distributions shall be made or shall commence at such time as the Participant (or his Beneficiary) may elect in accordance with Section 10.4. With respect to distributions made on or after January 1,2002, for purposes of this subsection, the value of the Participant s vested Account Balance shal1 be determined without regard to that portion of the Account Balance that is attributable to Rollover Contributions (and earnings allocable thereto). 
 In the event of a mandatory distribution greater than 1,000 in accordance with the preceding paragraph, if a distribute does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan (as defined below) specified by the distributee in a direct rollover (if allowed under applicable law) or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with this Article X, then the Plan will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the Investment Committee in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(3 l)(B). 
 Solely with respect to any mandatory distributions as described above, all distributions shall be made in cash provided that any distribution to any distributee who so elects, shall be paid in Company Stock as provided below, except that any fractional interest in a share of Company Stock shall be paid in cash. 
 The preceding mandatory distributions shall be done in accordance with Code Sections 411(a)(11) and 401(a)(31)(B), and any other applicable law. Any consent and elections required under the above paragraphs shall be made in conformance with the applicable rules of Article X or such other rules prescribed by the Administrative Committee. 
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee s election under this Section 10.1(b), a distributee may elect, at that time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrative Committee, to have any portion of eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the account balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period often (10) years or more any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 40l(a)(9) of the Code for distributions made prior to January 1, 2002, the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities) and any distribution made on or after January 1,1999 that qualifies as a hardship distribution. 
 An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code (other than an endowment contract), an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee s eligible rollover distribution. For distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan shall also include an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, and an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political division of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of such a state or political subdivision thereof, which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. For distributions made on or after January 1, 2008, and subject to any applicable rules under Sections 402(c) and 408A of the Code, an eligible retirement plan shall also include a Roth IRA as described in Section 408A of the Code. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, a non-spousal Beneficiary distributee, or a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a QDRO, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution made prior to January 1, 2002 to a surviving spouse or an eligible rollover distribution made to a non-spousal Beneficiary distributee, an eligible retirement plan is limited to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity in accordance with the Code and applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 402(c)(11) of the Code). 
 37 

For distributions made after December 31, 2001, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. Such portion, however, may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or is transferred to a qualified defined benefit pension plan (only for Plan Years after 2006) or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
 The Administrative Committee need not obtain evidence that a retirement plan had received an IRS determination letter in order to have a reasonable belief that a retirement plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. For purposes of this Section 10.1(b), a distributee includes an Employee or former 
 Employee. In addition, the Employee s or former Employee s surviving spouse or non-spousal beneficiary (or other eligible distributee as defined under the Code and applicable law) and the Employee s or former Employee s spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of such person. 
 (c) The value of any distribution shall be based on the Current Market Value of the Participant s Account. 
 10.2 Method of Distribution . Subject to Section 10.1(a), a Former Participant s Account shall be paid to him (or to his Beneficiary) in a lump sum unless the Participant (or his Beneficiary) elects the methods specified in this Section 10.2, in the manner specified by the Administrative Committee or its designee 
 (a) Annual Installments . In annual installment payment over (i) a fixed period of up to 15 years (but not exceeding the life expectancy of the Former Participant, or the joint and last survivor expectancy of the Former Participant and his Beneficiary) or (ii) if the Former Participant s life expectancy exceeds 15 years, the life expectancy of the Former Participant. The amount to be paid to the Former Participant (or Beneficiary) in each installment shall be determined by multiplying the value of the account balances, determined in accordance with Section 10.1(c) as though the date of the installment were the distribution date, by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of installments remaining to be distributed. The life expectancy of the Former Participant and his Beneficiary will be calculated by use of the return multiples specified in Section 1.72-9 of the Regulations. The life expectancy of a Former Participant and his Beneficiary may not be recalculated. 
 If a Former Participant who has elected to receive installments dies prior to receiving all such installments, any remaining installments will be paid when due to the Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary elects, in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the Participant s death. In the event a Beneficiary dies while receiving installment payments (or prior to receiving the complete Account amounts), amounts remaining to be paid shall be paid in a lump sum to said Beneficiary s estate . 
 (b) Partial Distribution . Effective October 1, 2024, Participant (or his Beneficiary) may elect to receive partial distributions of a designated portion of the Former Participant s Account as elected by the Former Participant (or Beneficiary) in accordance with any policies adopted by the Administrative Committee which policies may include imposing a reasonable distribution amount, frequency limitations or other reasonable administrative conditions. 
 (c) Alternate Method . Alternate methods of distribution may apply to any portion of a Participant s Account that has been transferred to the Plan from another qualified plan pursuant to Section 3.6. 
 10.3 Form of Distribution . Subject to Section 10.1(a), distributions under the Plan shall be made in the following manner 
 38 

(a) all distributions from other than the Olin Common Stock Fund shall be paid in cash, except that such amounts may, at the election of the distributee, be paid in Company Stock with any fractional interest in a share of Company Stock paid in cash 
 (b) all distributions from the Olin Common Stock Fund shall be paid in Company Stock, except that any fractional interest in a share of Company Stock shall be paid in cash provided that any distribution to any other distributee who so elects, shall be in cash as provided below. 
 10.4 Date of Distribution . Generally, distributions will be made as soon as practicable on or after the distribution date elected by the distributee provided, however, that in the discretion of the Administrative Committee, distributions may be made or commence within sixty (60) days of the distribution date elected. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, distributions shall commence no later than the Participant s Required Beginning Date. 
 In the event of the Participant s death prior to his Required Beginning Date as described in the preceding paragraph, distribution of the Participant s Account shall be completed within five years after the Participant s death unless distribution is made over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Beneficiary and either (a) the Participant s Beneficiary is his Spouse and payments begin no later than the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70 1 2 (or age 72, if such Participant would have attained age 70 1 2 after December 31, 2019) or (b) distribution begins within one year of the Participant s death. 
 (a) General Rules . 
 (i) The provisions of this Section 10.4(a)-(e) will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year, as well as to be required minimum distributions made after the adoption of this restated Plan. 
 (ii) Coordination with Minimum Distribution Requirements Previously in Effect. If the total amount of 2002 required minimum distributions under the Plan made to the distributee prior to the effective date of this Section 10.4(a)-(e) equals or exceeds the required minimum distributions determined under this Section 10.4(a)-(e), then no additional distributions will be required to be made for 2002 on or after such date to the distributee. If the total amount of 2002 required minimum distributions under the Plan made to the distributee prior to the effective date of this Section 10.4(a)-(e) is less than the amount determined under this Section 10.4(a)-(e), then required minimum distributions for 2002 on and after such date will be determined so that the total amount of required minimum distributions for 2002 made to the distributee will be the amount determined under this Section 10.4(a)-(e). 
 (iii) The requirements of this Section 10.4(a)-(e) will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. 
 (iv) All distributions required under this Section 10.4(a)-(e) will be determined and made in accordance with the Regulations under Section 401 (a)(9) of the Code. With respect to distributions made for calendar years on or after January 1, 2003, distributions will be determined in accordance with the final and temporary regulations issued under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code on April 17, 2002, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary. 
 (v) TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 10.4(a)-(e), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that relate to no later than the Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
 (vi) 2009 RMD Relief under the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10.4(a)-(e) or the Plan, a Participant (or Beneficiary) who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Section 401(a)(9)(H) of the Code 2009 RMDs ), and who would have satisfied that requirement by receiving 
 39 

distributions that are equal to the 2009 RMDs (but not including any elected installment distribution which satisfies in part or all of your required 
 minimum distributions for 2009), will not receive those 2009 RMD distributions for 2009. The preceding will be determined and administered in accordance with Section 401(a)(9)(H) of the Code. 
 (b) Time and Manner of Distribution . 
 (i) Required Beginning Date. The Participant s entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, at the Participant s Required Beginning Date. 
 (ii) Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin. If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant s entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows 
 (A) If the Participant s surviving spouse is the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary, then, except as provided in Section 10.4(b)(ii)(E) of this Section 10.4(a)-(e), distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1 2 (or age 72, if such Participant would have attained age 70 1 2 after December 31, 2019), if later. 
 (B) If the Participant s surviving spouse is not the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary, then, except as provided in Section 10.4(b)(ii)(E) of this Section 10.4(a)-(e), distributions to the Designated Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died. 
 (C) If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant s death, the Participant s entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant s death. 
 (D) If the Participant s surviving spouse is the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this Section 10.4(b)(ii) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant, but the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Section 2.2(b)(i). 
 (E) Election to Apply 5-Year Rule to Distributions to Designated Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding 2.2(a) and (b) above, the Company elects to adopt the following optional provisions. 
 (1) distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, distribution to the Designated Beneficiary is not required to begin by the date specified in Subsection 2.2(a) or (b) above and Section 5.2B below, but, if such distribution does not begin by the date specified, the Participant s entire interest will be distributed to the Designated Beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant s death. If the Participant s surviving spouse is the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to either the Participant or the surviving spouse begin, this rule will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. 
 (2) Election to Allow Participants or Beneficiaries to Elect 5- Year Rule. Participants or Beneficiaries may elect on an individual basis whether the 5-year rule or the Life Expectancy rule in Sections 2.2 and 4.2 of this Section 10.4(a)-(e) applies to distributions after the death of a Participant who has a Designated Beneficiary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin under Section 2.2, or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth 
 40 

anniversary of the Participant s (or, if applicable, surviving spouse s) death. If neither the Participant nor Beneficiary makes an election under this paragraph, distributions will be made in accordance with Subsection 2.2(e)(1). 
 For purposes of this Section 10.4(b)(ii) and Section 10.4(d), unless Section 10.4(b)(ii)(D) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant s Required Beginning Date. If Section 10.4(b)(ii)(D) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to be given to the surviving spouse under Section 10.4(b)(ii)(A) If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant s Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant s surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 10.4(b)(ii)(A)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
 (iii) Forms of Distribution. Unless the Participant s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year distributions will be made in accordance with Section 10.4(c) and (d). If the Participant s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. 
 (c) Required Minimum Distributions During Participant s Lifetime . 
 (i) Amount of Required Minimum Distribution For Each Distribution Calendar Year. During the Participant s lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year is the lesser of 
 (A) the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s Account Balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Regulations, using the Participant s age as of the Participant s birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year or 
 (B) if the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant s spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s Account Balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Regulations, using the Participant s and spouse s attained ages as of the Participant s and spouse s birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year. 
 (ii) Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant s Death. Required minimum distributions will be determined under this Section 10.4(c) beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant s date of death. 
 (d) Required Minimum Distributions After Participant s Death . 
 (i) Death On or After Date Distributions Begin . 
 (A) Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s account balance by the longer of the remaining life expectancy of the Participant or the remaining life expectancy of the Participant s Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows 
 (1) The Participant s remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
 41 

(2) If the Participant s surviving spouse is the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant s death using the surviving spouse s age as of the spouse s birthday in that year. For distribution calendar years after the year of the surviving spouse s death, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse s birthday in the calendar year of the spouse s death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year. 
 (3) If the Participant s surviving spouse is not the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary s remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant s death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
 (B) No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant s death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s Account Balance by the Participant s remaining life expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
 (ii) Death Before Date Distributions Begin . 
 (A) Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant s account balance by the remaining life expectancy of the Participant s Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in Section 4.1. 
 (B) No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant s death, distribution of the Participant s entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant s death. 
 (C) Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Are Required to Begin. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant s surviving spouse is the Participant s sole Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 10.4(b)(ii)(A), this Section 10.4(d)(ii) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. 
 (e) Definitions . The following definitions shall supersede any conflicting definitions in Article I of the Plan.

For distributions beginning after the Participant s death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under Section 10.4(b). The required minimum distribution for the Participant s first Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or before the Participant s Required Beginning Date. The required minimum distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the required minimum 
 42 

distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in which the Participant s Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that distribution calendar year.

The account balance for the valuation calendar year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the plan either in the valuation calendar year or in the distribution calendar year if distributed or transferred in the valuation calendar year. 
 (v) Required Beginning Date . The date specified in the definition of Required Beginning Date in Article I of the Plan. 
 10.5 Compliance with Applicable Law . Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, distributions under this Plan shall be made in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and any Regulations issued thereunder (as described in Section 10.4) and in accordance with Section 409(o) of the Code. To the extent that any provision of the Plan is inconsistent with such section of the Code or applicable Regulations, such Plan provision shall be disregarded. The assets of the Plan attributable to employer securities acquired by the Plan in a sale to which Section 1042 of the Code applies cannot accrue for the benefit of persons specified in Section 409(n) of the Code during the non-allocation period. 
 10.6 Distributions to Comply with Qualified Domestic Relations Order . In the case of any Participant with respect to whom the Plan has received a QDRO awarding an alternate payee all or any portion of the Participant s interest under the Plan, the following rules shall apply 
 (a) Subject to Section 10.1(b), if necessary to comply with the terms of the QDRO, or if not prohibited by the terms of the QDRO and requested by the alternate payee, an amount shall be distributed to the alternate payee from the vested portion of the Participant s Account (net of any outstanding loans) sufficient to comply with the terms of the QDRO. Such amount shall be distributed to the alternate payee in a lump sum as soon as practicable and if the full amount required under the QDRO to be distributed from the Plan is so distributed, the alternate payee shall have no further interest in the Plan. If the Participant s vested interest (net of any outstanding loans) in the Plan is less than the amount necessary to comply with terms of the QDRO, no amount shall be distributed to the alternate payee pursuant to this Section 10.6 and amounts due under the QDRO to the Alternate Payee shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the QDRO and applicable law. 
 (b) In the event that the amounts due the alternate payee under a QDRO are not distributed to the alternate payee pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the alternate payee s interest shall be held in a separate account segregated from the Participant s Account, and the value of the Participant s Account shall be calculated without reference to such amounts segregated pursuant to this paragraph. 
 (c) In accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee, if a domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code (including, in the Administrative Committee s discretion, a restraining order), is received, then no distribution, in-service withdrawal or loan from the Plan shall be made to the Participant until it is determined whether the domestic relations order constitutes a QDRO, but in no event shall such suspension of distributions, withdrawals and loans continue beyond the date which is 18 months following the receipt of such domestic relations order. Notwithstanding the above, if a distribution from the Plan to the Participant or his Beneficiary is required to comply with applicable law under ERISA or the Code, then a distribution shall be made to the extent necessary to comply with such law. 
 10.7 Distribution Rights Pertaining to Stock Distributions . 
 43 

(a) A Participant or Beneficiary who receives a distribution of Company Stock from the Plan which at the time of distribution is not publicly traded or is subject to any restrictions on disposition under any federal or state securities law or any regulation thereunder, or pursuant to any agreement affecting such Stock, which would make such Stock not as freely tradable as stock not subject to such restrictions shall have a put option with respect to such Stock upon terms no less favorable than the following 
 (i) Upon receipt of the Stock, the distributee shall have sixty (60) days to require, by filing written request with the Administrative Committee, that the Company (or if the Trustee so elects, the Trustee) repurchase the Stock at its fair market value. If the put option is not exercised within the applicable period, it will temporarily lapse 
 (ii) If there is a temporary lapse of the put option under (i), above, after the close of the Plan Year in which such lapse occurs the Company shall determine the value of the Stock at the end of that Plan Year and notify the distributee of such value, who will then have sixty 
 (60) days to require, by filing written request with the Administrative Committee, that the Company (or if the Trustee so elects, the Trustee) repurchase the Stock. If the put option is not exercised in the applicable period it will permanently lapse. 
 (iii) If the Stock is contributed by a distributee to an IRA, the trustee of the IRA will have, and may exercise, in the same manner, the put option that the distributee otherwise would have had. 
 (iv) Payment for Company Stock sold under a put option may be made in a lump sum or in installments, with interest at a reasonable rate determined by the Company and adequate security provided on any unpaid balance. With respect to any installment payments, such installment payments must be made in substantially equal, periodic payments (at least annually over a period not to exceed 5 years). Payment in respect of a put option must begin no later than 30 days after the put option is exercised. 
 On a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, the Administrative Committee from time to time in its sole discretion may grant put options on a more simplified basis so long as such options are not less favorable to Participants than as provided above. 
 (b) Company Stock distributions under the Plan shall be in whole shares, containing such legends and upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as the Administrative Committee may determine to be necessary or appropriate to satisfy requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable laws or regulations, or to provide the Company (or the Trustee), if so requested, with a right of first refusal with respect to the Stock being distributed, such right to be exercisable only if the Stock is not publicly traded at the time the right may be exercised. With respect to such right of first refusal, (i) when a Participant receives an offer by a third party to buy such Company Stock, the Participant must notify the Company (and Trustee) of the written offer by the third party to purchase the securities, and (ii) the Company (or Trustee) has 14 days to match the offer by the third party or to pay, if greater, the fair market value of the securities (as determined under Section 4975 of the Code). The order of priority for the right of first refusal would be the Company, then the Trustee. 
 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.7, no Company Stock shall be subject to a put, call, or other option, or buy sell or similar arrangement while held in the Fund or at the time of distribution therefrom. 
 (d) The protections and rights contained in this Section 10.7 shall be nonterminable and, accordingly, shall continue to exist, even if the Plan ceases to be an employee stock ownership plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code.

 (iii) Non-Key Employee means any Employee (and any Beneficiary of an Employee) who does not meet the definition of Key Employee.

 52 

notify the claimant of the results for the extension before the end of the initial ninety (90) day period. The extended period may not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the filing of the claim. 
 A notice of adverse benefit determination must be in written or electronic form. Such notice shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant

This period may be extended by the Administrative Committee for up to thirty (30) days, provided that the Administrative Committee determines that such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial forty-five (45) day period, of the reasons for the extension. If, prior to the end of the first thirty (30) day extension period, the Administrative Committee determines that, due to matters beyond the control of the Plan, a decision cannot be rendered within that extension period, the period for making the determination may be extended for up to an additional thirty (30) days, provided that the Administrative Committee notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the first thirty 
 (30) day extension period, of the reasons for the extension. A notice of extension under this paragraph shall specifically explain the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and the additional information needed to resolve those issues, and the claimant shall be afforded at least forty-five (45) days within which to provide the specified information (the period for making the benefit determination shall be toned from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information). 
 Every person whose claim for benefits under the Plan is denied in whole or in part by the Administrative Committee shall have the right to request a review of such denial. Such review shall be granted upon written request therefor filed by the claimant with the Administrative Committee within sixty 
 (60) days following receipt of the notice of the denial (within one hundred and eighty (180) days for disability benefit claims). Such review shall be conducted by the Administrative Committee (or another committee to be designated by the Company). For any review by the Administrative Committee, the claimant, in person or by duly authorized representative, may submit written comments, documents, records and other information related to the benefit claim on appeal. The claimant shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the benefit claim. The review on appeal will consider all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 
 The Administrative Committee shall decide the matter with reasonable promptness and in any event within sixty (60) days (forty-five (45) days for disability benefit claims) after receipt of the appeal. If 
 Administrative Committee determines that an extension is necessary, the Administrative Committee shall notify the claimant of the reasons for the extension before the end of such initial period. The extended period may not exceed one 
 53 

hundred and twenty (120) days (ninety (90) days if the claim relates to disability benefits) following receipt of a request for review. Its decision shall be in written or electronic form, and, in the event of an adverse benefit determination, shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, (i) the specific reasons for the decision, (ii) the provisions of the Plan on which the determination is based (iii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the benefit claim and (iv) a statement regarding the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA Section 502(a).

 16.9 Applicable Law . All questions pertaining to the construction, validity and effect of the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law), to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA. 
 16.10 Gender and Number . In the construction of the Plan, the masculine shall include the feminine and the singular shall include the plural in all cases where such meanings would be appropriate. 
 16.11 Headings . The headings of Articles and Sections are included solely for convenience of reference and shall have no effect upon the meaning of the provisions hereof. 
 16.12 Veterans Rights Upon Re-Employment . 
 Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, effective for reemployments commencing on or after December 12, 1994, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Code. 
 Effective January 1, 2007, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the case of a Participant who dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the Code), the Beneficiaries of such Participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the Plan had such Participant resumed and then terminated employment on account of death. 
 Effective January 1, 2009, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, any differential wage payments (as defined in Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) received by a Participant shall be treated as compensation for purposes of Section 415 of the Code under Section 3.7 (but not for purposes of determining contributions and benefits under the Plan). 
 16.13 Statute of Limitations & Mitigation . After exhausting the Plan s administrative claim and appeal provisions, an individual wishing to bring a lawsuit in either state or federal court challenging a claim denial must commence the lawsuit no later than six months after the individual receives a final denial letter indicating the individual has exhausted his or her administrative appeals and has the right to file a lawsuit. In addition to this six month deadline that applies to filing a lawsuit after the claims and appeals procedures are exhausted, a general time limitation shall apply to all lawsuits involving all types of Plan issues. An individual must commence any such lawsuit involving Plan claims no later than two years after the individual first receives information that constitutes a clear repudiation of the rights the individual is seeking to assert (i.e., the underlying event or issue that should have triggered the individual s awareness that his or her rights under the Plan may have been violated). Although any period of time when an individual s claim is in the claims procedure described above (i.e., the time between when an individual files a claim for benefits with the Administrative Committee and the time the individual receives a final determination letter from the Administrative Committee) does not count against the two-year period, once the claims procedure process is completed, the two year period will continue running from the point at which it was tolled. 
 54 

In order to mitigate any damages or other negative effects, individuals must always carefully review their account statements, confirmations, payroll records (e.g., for deductions and contributions made to the plan) and any other records relating to the Plan, and report any discrepancies or other concerns within 30 days of the date of the applicable record through the procedures discussed in the summary plan description. An individual must file a claim under the Plan s claim procedures if his or her concerns cannot be resolved within this time. Neither the Company, the Plan, the Administrative Committee, nor any of their agents or employees will be responsible for damages or other negative effects incurred by an individual caused by such individual s failure to follow these requirements and procedures. In order to raise an issue in any legal action related to the claim, an individual must have clearly raised such issue during the claims and appeals procedure. 
 If a legal action begun against the Trustee, the Company, an Affiliated Company or an Participating Employer by or on behalf of any person results adversely to that person, or if a legal action arises because of conflicting claims to a Participant s or other person s benefits, the cost to the Trustee, the Company, an Affiliated Company or a Participating Employer of defending the action will be charged to the extent permitted by law to the sums, if any, which were involved in the action or were payable to the person concerned. 
 16.14 Evidence . Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information which the person acting on it considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties.
