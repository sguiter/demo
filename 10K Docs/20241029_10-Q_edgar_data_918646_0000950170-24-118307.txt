notice period. We invoice customers upon shipment, and our collection terms range from to days. Revenue from the sale of cement, concrete, aggregates, and gypsum wallboard not related to long-term supply agreements is recognized upon shipment of the related products to customers, which is when title and ownership are transferred, and the customer is obligated to pay. Revenue from sales under our long-term supply agreements is also recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which generally occurs at the time the product is shipped from the production facility or terminal location. Our long-term supply agreements with customers define, among other commitments, the volume of product that we must provide and the volume that the customer must purchase by the end of the defined periods. Pricing structures under our agreements are generally market-based, but are subject to certain contractual adjustments. Shortfall amounts, if applicable under these arrangements, are constrained and not recognized as Revenue until an agreement is reached with the customer and, therefore, are not subject to the risk of reversal. The Company offers certain of its customers, including those with long-term supply agreements, rebates and incentives, which we treat as variable consideration. We adjust the amount of Revenue recognized for the variable consideration using the most likely amount method based on past history and projected volumes in the rebate and incentive period. Any amounts billed to customers for taxes are excluded from Revenue. The Company has elected to treat freight and delivery charges we pay for the delivery of goods to our customers as a fulfillment activity rather than a separate performance obligation. When we arrange for a third party to deliver products to customers, fees for shipping and handling billed to the customer are recorded as Revenue, while costs we incur for shipping and handling are recorded as expenses and included in Cost of Goods Sold. Other Non-Operating Income includes lease and rental income, asset sale income, non-inventoried aggregates sales income, distribution center income, and trucking income, as well as other miscellaneous revenue items and costs that have not been allocated to a business segment. 

million at both September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, respectively. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers. The allowance for credit losses is based on analysis of economic trends in the construction industry, detailed analysis of the expected collectability of past-due accounts receivable, and the expected collectability of overall receivables. We have no significant credit risk concentration among our diversified customer base.

to . Our lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. In calculating the present value of future minimum lease payments, we use the rate implicit in the lease if it can be determined. Otherwise, we use our incremental borrowing rate in effect at the commencement of the lease to determine the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Additionally, we lease certain equipment under short-term leases with initial terms of less than 12 months, which are not recorded on the balance sheet.

Under the terms of the 2023 Plan, we can issue equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights to employees of the Company, members of the Board of Directors and consultants, independent contractors, and agents of the Company. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) specifies grant terms for awards under the Plan . Fiscal 2025 Equity Awards In May 2024, the Compensation Committee awarded to certain officers and key employees an aggregate of performance stock units and performance stock options, as compensation for achievement of the target level of performance (collectively, the Performance Stock Awards). For the Performance Stock Awards to be earned, the Company must achieve performance vesting criteria as modified based on the Company s average absolute total stockholder return during the performance period. to measured at the end of fiscal 2027 (three-year performance period) as modified by total stockholder return . Performance outcomes (taking into account both criteria) will result in a threshold vesting percentage of of target and maximum performance will result in a vesting percentage of of target. If the threshold vesting percentage is not achieved, none of the Performance Stock Awards will be earned. Our Performance Stock Awards are evaluated on a quarterly basis with adjustments to compensation expense based on the likelihood of the performance targets being achieved or exceeded. The maximum expense for our outstanding Performance Stock Awards is approximately million. Any forfeitures are recognized as a reduction to expense in the period in which they occur .

In addition to the Performance Stock Awards discussed above, the Compensation Committee approved the granting to certain officers and key employees an aggregate of time-vesting stock options, which vest ratably over (the Fiscal 2025 Employee Time-Vesting Stock Option Grant) and shares of time-vesting restricted stock units, which vest ratably over (the Fiscal 2025 Employee Restricted Stock Unit Time-Vesting Award). The Fiscal 2025 Employee Restricted Stock Unit Time-Vesting Award was valued at the closing price of the stock on the grant date and is being expensed over a three-year period. The Fiscal 2025 Employee Time-Vesting Stock Option Grant was valued at its grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which used similar inputs as the Monte Carlo analysis shown above . In August 2024, the Compensation Committee granted options to members of the Board of Directors (the Fiscal 2025 Board of Directors Stock Option Award). Options granted under the Fiscal 2025 Board of Directors Stock Option Award vest one year after the grant date, and can be exercised from the date of vesting until their expiration on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The Fiscal 2025 Board of Directors Stock Option Award was valued at its grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is being expensed over a one-year period.

In August 2024, the Compensation Committee granted shares of time-vesting restricted stock to members of the Board of Directors (the Fiscal 2025 Board of Directors Restricted Stock Award). Restricted stock granted under the Fiscal 2025 Board of Directors Restricted Stock Award vest one year after the grant date, and were valued at the closing price of the stock on the grant date. The value of the Fiscal 2025 Board of Directors Restricted Stock Award is being expensed over a period. In addition to the awards described above, we may issue equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, to certain employees from time to time. Any options issued are valued using the Black-Scholes options pricing model on the grant date and expensed over the vesting period, while restricted stock and restricted stock units are valued using the closing price on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period.

Revolving Credit Facility We have an unsecured million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility includes a separate million term loan facility (the Term Loan) and also provides the Company the option to increase the borrowing capacity by up to million (for a total borrowing capacity of

million letter of credit facility and a swingline loan sub-facility of million, and expires on May 5, 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants for an unsecured investment-grade facility, including covenants that restrict the Company s and/or its subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt; encumber assets; merge with or transfer or sell assets to other persons; and enter into certain affiliate transactions. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a Leverage Ratio of :1.00 or less and an Interest Coverage Ratio (both ratios, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) equal to or greater than to 1.00 (collectively, the Financial Covenants). At the Company s option, outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at a variable rate equal to either (i) the adjusted term SOFR rate (secured overnight financing rate), plus 10 basis points, plus an agreed spread (ranging from to basis points, which is established based on the Company's credit rating); (ii) in respect of any Revolving Loans (until such time as the then-existing Benchmark (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) is replaced in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility), the adjusted daily simple SOFR rate, plus 10 basis points, plus an agreed spread (ranging from 100 to 162.5 basis points, which is established based on the Company's credit rating) or (iii) an Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), which is the highest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) in effect on any applicable day, (b) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) in effect on any applicable day, plus of 1 , and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) for a one month interest period on any applicable day, or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day, plus 1.0 , in each case plus an agreed upon spread (ranging from to basis points), which is established quarterly based on the Company's credit rating. The Company is also required to pay a facility fee on unused available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility ranging from to basis points, which is established based on the Company's then credit rating. The Company pays each lender a participation fee with respect to such lender s participations in letters of credit, which fee accrues at the same Applicable Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), plus a fronting fee for each letter of credit issued by the issuing bank in an amount equal to basis points per annum on the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such letter of credit. The Company also pays each issuing bank such bank s standard fees with respect to issuance, amendment or extensions of letters of credit and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges relating to such issuing bank s letters of credit from time to time. There were million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, plus million outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2024, resulting in million of available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of the outstanding letters of credit. We were in compliance with all Financial Covenants on September 30, 2024; therefore, the entire million is available for future borrowings. Term Loan On May 5, 2022, we borrowed the million Term Loan under the Revolving Credit Facility, and used these proceeds to, among other things, pay down a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of million, with any unpaid amounts due upon maturity on . At the Company s option, principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loan bear interest as set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, at a daily simple SOFR rate unless and until such time as the then-existing Benchmark (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) is replaced in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility).

million aggregate principal amount of 2.500 senior notes due (the Senior Unsecured Notes). The 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes were issued net of original issue discount of million and have an effective interest rate of approximately . The original issue discount is being amortized by the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable prior to April 1, 2031, at a redemption price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes being redeemed, plus the present value of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest from the applicable redemption date to April 1, 2031, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury rate plus basis points. The 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable on or after April 1, 2031, at a redemption price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. If we experience certain change of control triggering events, we would be required to offer to repurchase the 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. The indenture governing the 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes contains certain covenants that limit our ability to create or permit to exist certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets, and provides for certain events of default that, if any occurred, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes to become or be declared due and payable.

Our operations are conducted in the U.S. and include the mining of limestone for the manufacture, production, distribution, and sale of portland cement (a basic construction material that is the essential binding ingredient in concrete); the grinding and sale of slag; the mining of gypsum for the manufacture and sale of gypsum wallboard; the manufacture and sale of recycled paperboard to the gypsum wallboard industry and other paperboard converters; the sale of readymix concrete; and the mining and sale of aggregates (crushed stone, sand, and gravel). We operate modern cement plants (one of which is operated through a joint venture located in Buda, Texas), slag grinding facility, and over cement distribution terminals. Our cement companies focus on the U.S. heartland and operate as an integrated network selling product primarily in California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. We operate readymix concrete batch plants and aggregates processing plants in markets that are complementary to our cement network. We operate gypsum wallboard plants and a recycled paperboard mill. We distribute gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard throughout the continental U.S., with the exception of the Northeast.

Segment Operating Earnings, including the proportionately consolidated 50 interest in the revenue and expenses of the Joint Venture, represent Revenue, less direct operating expenses, segment Depreciation, and segment Selling, General, and Administrative expenses. We account for intersegment sales at market prices. Corporate assets consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, general office assets, and miscellaneous other assets. The basis used to disclose Identifiable Assets; Capital Expenditures; and Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization conforms with the equity method, and is similar to how we disclose these accounts in our Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets and Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Interest Expense, net 

Interest Income includes interest earned on investments of excess cash. Components of Interest Expense include interest associated with the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, Senior Unsecured Notes, and commitment fees based on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. Other Expenses include amortization of debt issuance costs and Revolving Credit Facility costs.

million. In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications that are both standard in the industry and specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business. These indemnifications may include claims relating to any of the following: environmental and tax matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; customer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and construction contracts and financial matters. While the maximum amount to which the Company may be exposed under such agreements cannot be estimated, management believes these indemnifications will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently have outstanding guarantees. We are currently contingently liable for performance under million in performance bonds required by certain states and municipalities, and their related agencies. The bonds are principally for certain reclamation obligations and mining permits. We have indemnified the underwriting insurance company against any exposure under the performance bonds. In our experience, no material claims have been made against these financial instruments. 

 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 

The carrying values of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Accrued Liabilities approximate their fair values at September 30, 2024, due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan also approximates the carrying value at September 30, 2024.

I TEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 We are a leading manufacturer of heavy construction materials and light building materials in the United States. Our primary products, Portland Cement and Gypsum Wallboard, are commodities that are essential in commercial and residential construction; public construction projects; and projects to build, expand, and repair roads and highways. Demand for our products is generally cyclical and seasonal, depending on economic and geographic conditions. We distribute our products throughout most of the United States, except the Northeast, which provides us with regional economic diversification. However, general economic downturns or localized downturns in the regions where we have operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our business is organized into two sectors: Heavy Materials, which includes the Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments; and Light Materials, which includes the Gypsum Wallboard and Recycled Paperboard segments. Financial results and other information for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are presented on a consolidated basis and by these business segments Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Recycled Paperboard. 
 We conduct one of our cement operations through a joint venture, Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP, which is located in Buda, Texas (the Joint Venture). We own a 50 interest in the Joint Venture and account for our interest under the equity method of accounting. We proportionately consolidate our 50 share of the Joint Venture s Revenue and Operating Earnings in the presentation of our Cement segment, which is the way management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. 
 All our business activities are conducted in the United States. These activities include the mining of limestone for the manufacture, production, distribution, and sale of portland cement, including portland limestone cement (a basic construction material that is the essential binding ingredient in concrete); the grinding and sale of slag; the mining of gypsum for the manufacture and sale of gypsum wallboard; the manufacture and sale of recycled paperboard to the gypsum wallboard industry and other paperboard converters; the sale of readymix concrete; and the mining and sale of aggregates (crushed stone, sand, and gravel). 
 On August 9, 2024, we finalized the Acquisition of an aggregates operation in Battletown, Kentucky. The purchase price of the Acquisition was approximately 24.9 million. The Acquisition is included in our Heavy Materials sector, and its results of operations are reported in the Concrete and Aggregates business segment. See Footnote (B) in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Acquisition. 
 MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 
 Our end markets remained resilient despite the Federal Reserve's continued restrictive monetary policy throughout most of the first half of our fiscal year, and they may benefit from more accommodative monetary policy moving forward. Although Cement Sales Volume declined in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Gypsum Wallboard Sales Volume increased. 
 Demand Outlook 
 We expect demand for cement to remain steady in the near term given growth in heavy industrial construction and the continued health of state and local budgets to support infrastructure projects. To date, only approximately 25 of federal funding from the trillion-dollar Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has been spent. We anticipate a pick-up in demand as the remaining approximately 75 of IIJA funds gets spent on public construction and repair projects. 
 20 

In residential construction, activity has remained steady. While the higher interest rate environment has been a headwind for housing demand and affordability, several factors, including the chronic housing shortage caused by more than a decade of underproduction and exacerbated by the "rate lock-in", has supported solid levels of housing construction activity. Moving forward, lower interest rates and continued healthy consumer balance sheets should support residential construction. We believe our geographic footprint across the U.S. heartland and fast-growing Sun Belt region positions us to capitalize on these favorable market dynamics. 

Cost Outlook 
 We believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure and meet our customers needs during the second half of this fiscal year. Our substantial raw material reserves for our Cement, Aggregates, and Gypsum Wallboard businesses, and their proximity to our respective manufacturing facilities, support our low-cost producer position across all our business segments. 
 Energy costs decreased in all our businesses during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared with fiscal 2024. We anticipate fuel costs will be lower in fiscal 2025 but will remain higher than they have been historically. We are expecting increases in freight and delivery costs in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024. 
 The primary raw material used to produce paperboard is OCC. Prices for OCC increased during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared with fiscal 2024. Fiber prices are subject to change upon short notice due to several factors, including supply of OCC and demand for OCC from both domestic and international companies. Our current customer contracts for gypsum liner include price adjustments that partially compensate for changes in raw material fiber prices. However, because these price adjustments are not realized until future quarters, material costs in our Gypsum Wallboard segment are likely to fluctuate until the effects of these price adjustments are realized. 
 Maintenance costs increased in fiscal 2024, and we expect continued inflation for maintenance in fiscal 2025 as equipment and contractor costs remain high.

REVENUE 
 Revenue increased by 1.4 million to 623.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Acquisition contributed 1.7 million of Revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, Revenue decreased by 0.4 million. This decrease was due to lower Sales Volume, which adversely affected Revenue by approximately 17.0 million, and was partially offset by higher gross sales prices, which increased Revenue by 16.6 million. 
 COST OF GOODS SOLD 
 Cost of Goods Sold increased by 6.6 million, or 2 , to 419.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Acquisition contributed 2.1 million of Cost of Goods Sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, Cost of Goods Sold increased by 4.5 million, or 1 . The increase was due to higher operating costs of 16.4 million, partially offset by lower Sales Volume of 11.9 million. Higher operating costs were primarily related to our Cement and Concrete and Aggregates businesses and are discussed further in the segment analysis. 
 GROSS PROFIT 
 Gross Profit decreased 2 to 203.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily related to higher operating costs and lower Sales Volume, partially offset by higher gross sales prices. The gross margin declined to 33 , with higher operating costs being partially offset by a rise in gross sales prices. 
 EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE 
 Equity in Earnings of our Unconsolidated Joint Venture decreased 1.0 million, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross sales prices and higher operating costs, which reduced earnings by approximately 1.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively. This was partially offset by higher Sales Volume, which positively affected earnings by 0.4 million. 
 22 

CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
 Corporate General and Administrative expenses increased by approximately 1.3 million, or 8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to 1.0 million of costs associated with business development and transaction due diligence. 
 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME 
 Other Non-Operating Income consists of a variety of items that are unrelated to segment operations and include non-inventoried Aggregates income, asset sales, and other miscellaneous income and cost items. 
 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 Interest Expense, net increased by approximately 0.5 million, or 5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily due to higher interest on our Revolving Credit Facility, which was mostly related to higher average balances outstanding during the period. 
 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 
 Earnings Before Income Taxes decreased to 185.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily because of lower Gross Profit and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Venture and higher Corporate General and Administrative Expense and Interest Expense. 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 Income Tax Expense was 41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 43.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was consistent at 23 . 
 NET EARNINGS 
 Net Earnings decreased 5 to 143.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above.

The Acquisition contributed 1.7 million of Revenue during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, Revenue increased by 6.8 million, or 1 . The Revenue increase was due to higher gross sales prices, which positively affected Revenue by 43.5 million, partially offset by lower Sales Volume, which adversely affected Revenue by approximately 36.7 million. 
 COST OF GOODS SOLD 
 Cost of Goods Sold increased by 2.9 million to 841.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The Acquisition contributed 2.1 million of Cost of Goods Sold during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, Cost of Goods Sold increased by 0.8 million. The increase was due to higher operating costs of 28.4 million, partially offset by lower Sales Volume of 27.6 million. Higher operating costs were primarily related to our Cement and Concrete and Aggregates businesses and are discussed further in the segment analysis. 
 GROSS PROFIT 
 Gross Profit increased 1 to 390.7 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily related to higher gross sales prices, partially offset by lower Sales Volume and increased operating costs. The gross margin expanded to 32 , with higher gross sales prices being partially offset by a rise in operating costs. 
 EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE 
 Equity in Earnings of our Unconsolidated Joint Venture increased 3.5 million, or 26 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to lower operating costs and higher Sales Volume, which positively affected earnings by 4.0 million and 0.8 million, respectively. This was partially offset by lower gross sales prices, which adversely affected earnings by approximately 1.3 million. The decrease in operating costs was primarily related to maintenance, energy and freight, and distribution costs of approximately 2.1 million, 1.0 million, and 0.9 million, respectively. Lower maintenance costs for the six months were partly due to maintenance costs in the prior year being 2.8 million higher than normal given an extended outage that required additional maintenance spending and reduced production levels. 
 24 

CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
 Corporate General and Administrative expenses increased by approximately 5.2 million, or 19 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries, information technology upgrades, and costs associated with business development and transaction due diligence of 1.6 million, 1.2 million, and 1.5 million, respectively. 
 OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME 
 Other Non-Operating Income consists of a variety of items that are unrelated to segment operations and include non-inventoried Aggregates income, asset sales, and other miscellaneous income and cost items. 
 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 Interest Expense, net decreased by approximately 1.0 million, or 5 , during the six months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to approximately 0.5 million of lower interest on our Revolving Credit Facility, which was related to lower average outstanding borrowings, as well as increased interest income of 0.5 million on cash deposits. 
 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 
 Earnings Before Income Taxes increased to 356.2 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily because of higher Gross Profit and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Venture, which were partially offset by higher Corporate General and Administrative Expense. 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 Income Tax Expense was 78.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 78.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate of 22 remained consistent with the prior-year period. 
 NET EARNINGS 
 Net Earnings increased 2 to 277.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 Cement Revenue was 352.8 million, a 2 decrease, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower Sales Volume, which reduced Cement Revenue by approximately 16.2 million, partially offset by higher gross sales prices of 8.2 million. 
 Cement Operating Earnings decreased by 5.5 million to 115.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to lower Sales Volume and higher operating costs of 5.9 million and 7.8 million, respectively, partially offset by higher average sales prices of 8.2 million. Higher operating costs were primarily due to increased maintenance and litigation loss of approximately 6.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The Operating Margin decreased to 33 from 34 , as a result of higher operating costs, partially offset by the higher gross sales prices. 
 Six months ended September 30, 2024 
 Cement Revenue was 691.9 million, for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Cement Revenue was relatively flat, with increases of 28.4 million from gross sales prices being offset by lower Sales Volume of 26.3 million. 
 Cement Operating Earnings increased by 9.6 million to 205.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to higher gross sales prices of 28.4 million, which was partially offset by lower Sales Volume and higher operating costs of 8.3 million and 10.5 million, respectively. Higher operating costs consisted of 5.1 million of increased maintenance, 3.5 million of higher freight costs, 1.2 million increase in purchased raw materials, 2.1 million of higher labor costs, and a litigation loss of approximately 0.7 million. These higher costs were partially offset by the impact of recording in the prior year 2.8 million of acquired inventories at fair value. Cement Operating Margin increased to 30 from 28 , as a result of higher gross sales prices, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 Concrete and Aggregates Revenue remained relatively flat at 69.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, Revenue declined 1.6 million. The decline was due to lower Sales Volume, which reduced Revenue by 5.4 million, partially offset by higher gross sales prices of 3.8 million. 
 Operating Loss was approximately 1.0 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Aggregates Acquisition, Operating Loss was 0.7 million. The Operating Loss was due to lower Sales Volume and higher operating costs of 1.5 million and 7.6 million, respectively, partially offset by higher gross selling prices of 3.8 million. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher cost of materials, maintenance, delivery, and energy costs of approximately 3.2 million, 2.7 million, 0.4 million, and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 Six months ended September 30, 2024 
 Concrete and Aggregates Revenue was 134.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, Revenue declined 7.2 million. The decrease was due to lower Sales Volume, which reduced Revenue by 14.7 million. This was partially offset by higher gross sales prices of 7.5 million. 
 Operating Earnings were approximately 2.0 million, an 83 decrease. Excluding the Aggregates Acquisition, Operating Earnings decreased to 2.3 million. The decline in Operating Earnings was due to lower Sales Volume and higher operating costs of 3.4 million and 13.5 million, respectively. This was partially offset by higher gross selling prices of 7.5 million. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher cost of materials, maintenance, energy, and delivery expenses of approximately 4.3 million, 5.6 million, 1.8 million, and 1.7 million, respectively.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 Gypsum Wallboard Revenue was 215.0 million, a 3 increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher gross sales prices and Sales Volume, which increased Revenue by 0.4 million and 5.4 million, respectively. Our market share remained relatively consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Earnings increased 5 to 90.1 million, due to 0.4 million of higher gross sales prices, a 2.2 million increase in Sales Volume, and a decrease of 1.9 million in operating costs. Lower operating costs were primarily related to freight and energy, which increased Operating Earnings by approximately 0.9 million and 1.4 million, respectively. Operating Margin increased to 42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily because of lower operating costs and higher gross sales prices. Fixed costs are not a significant portion of the overall cost of wallboard; therefore, changes in utilization have a relatively minor impact on our operating cost per unit. 
 Six months ended September 30, 2024 
 Gypsum Wallboard Revenue was 432.8 million, a 1 increase for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increased gross sales prices and Sales Volume, which positively affected Revenue by 0.7 million and 3.8 million, respectively. Our market share remained relatively consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Earnings increased 4 to 184.1 million, primarily because of 0.7 million higher gross sales prices, a 1.5 million increase in Sales Volume, and a 5.3 million decrease in operating costs. Lower operating costs were primarily related to freight and energy, which increased Operating Earnings by approximately 3.0 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Operating Margin increased to 43 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily because of higher gross sales prices and lower operating expenses. Fixed costs are not a significant portion of the overall cost of wallboard; therefore, changes in utilization have a relatively minor impact on our operating cost per unit.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 Recycled Paperboard Revenue increased 18 to 50.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to higher gross sales prices and Sales Volume, which increased Revenue by 4.5 million and 3.3 million, respectively. Higher gross sales prices were related to the pricing provisions in our long-term sales agreements. 
 Operating Earnings increased 6 to 8.0 million, primarily because of higher gross sales prices and Sales Volume, which increased Operating Earnings by 4.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, which reduced Operating Earnings by approximately 4.6 million. The increase in operating costs was primarily related to higher input costs, namely fiber, which reduced Operating Earnings by approximately 5.7 million. This was partially offset by lower energy costs of 1.0 million. The Operating Margin decreased to 16 because of higher operating costs, partially offset by higher gross sales prices. Although the Company has certain pricing provisions in its long-term sales agreements, prices are adjusted only at certain times throughout the year, so price adjustments are not always reflected in the same period as the change in costs. 
 Six months ended September 30, 2024 
 Recycled Paperboard Revenue increased 19 to 105.0 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to higher gross sales prices and Sales Volume, which positively affected Revenue by 9.4 million and 7.3 million, respectively. Higher gross sales prices were related to the pricing provisions in our long-term sales agreements. 
 Operating Earnings increased 12 to 16.5 million, primarily because of higher gross sales prices and Sales Volume, which increased Operating Earnings by 9.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, which reduced Operating Earnings by approximately 8.9 million. The increase in operating costs was primarily related to higher input costs, namely fiber, which lowered Operating Earnings by approximately 12.5 million. This was partially offset by lower energy, chemicals, and freight costs of 2.0 million, 0.8 million, and 0.6 million, respectively. The Operating Margin decreased to 16 because of higher operating costs, partially offset by higher gross sales prices. Although the Company has certain pricing provisions in its long-term sales agreements, prices are adjusted only at certain times throughout the year, so price adjustments are not always reflected in the same period as the change in costs.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, alternative policies or estimation techniques could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare our financial statements. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. 
 The three Critical Accounting Policies that are material to our financial statements and that we believe require either the most judgment, or the selection or application of alternative accounting policies, are those related to long-lived assets, goodwill, and business combinations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these Critical Accounting Policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm. 
 Information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies and a summary of our significant account policies can be found in our Annual Report, in Note (A) top the consolidated financial statements. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Footnote (A) in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial statements. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We believe we currently have access to sufficient financial resources from our liquidity sources to fund our business and operations, including contractual obligations, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months. We regularly assess any potential disruptions to the economy, and to our operations, particularly changing fiscal policy or economic conditions affecting our industries. Please see the Debt Financing Activities section below for a discussion of our Revolving Credit Facility and the amount of borrowings available to us in the next twelve-month period.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased by 53.1 million to 365.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to higher cash flows related to 59.6 million of changes in working capital which was partially offset by lower Net Earnings, adjusted for approximately 1.5 million of non-cash charges and 2.5 million of lower dividends from our Unconsolidated Joint Venture. The increase in cash flows from the changes in working capital was due primarily to the 65.7 million increase in Income Taxes Payable, which resulted from our deferring tax payments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. The Internal Revenue Service granted this deferral to individuals and businesses in Texas that were affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that began on April 26, 2024, and triggered a Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declaration. We anticipate making all estimated tax payments, including the deferred amounts, for the nine months ending December 31, 2024, in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024. 
 Working capital increased by 29.9 million to 418.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared with March 31, 2024. The increase was due to higher Cash, Accounts and Notes Receivable, net, and Prepaid and Other Assets of 59.0 million, 43.3 million, and 6.2 million, respectively. This was partially offset by lower Income Tax Receivable of 7.4 million and higher Income Tax Payable and Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities of 5.2 million and 69.5 million, respectively. The August 2024 Acquisition increased working capital by approximately 0.7 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in Accounts Receivable at September 30, 2024, was primarily related to higher Revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2024. As a percentage of quarterly sales generated for the respective quarter, Accounts Receivable was approximately 40 at September 30, 2024 and 33 at March 31, 2024. Management measures the change in Accounts Receivable by monitoring the days sales outstanding on a monthly basis to determine if any deterioration has occurred in the collectability of the Accounts Receivable. No significant deterioration in the collectability of our Accounts Receivable was identified at September 30, 2024. 
 Our Inventory balance at September 30, 2024, increased by approximately 1.7 million from our balance at March 31, 2024. Excluding the Acquisition, our Inventory balance increased by 1.0 million. Within Inventory, Raw Materials and Materials-in-Progress, Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Fuel and Coal increased by approximately 2.7 million, 2.9 million, 0.8 million, and 3.5 million, respectively. This was partially offset by Finished Cement, Recycled Paperboard, and Repair Parts, which declined 5.7 million, 1.9 million, and 1.2 million, respectively. The decline in Finished Cement is consistent with our business cycle; we generally build up clinker inventory over the winter months to meet the demand for cement in the spring and summer. The decrease in Repair Parts inventory was primarily a result of completing most of our scheduled outages during the first six months of the fiscal year. The largest individual balance in our Inventory is our Repair Parts. The size and complexity of our manufacturing plants, as well as the age of certain of our plants, makes it necessary to stock a high level of repair parts inventory. We believe all of these repair parts are necessary, and we perform semi-annual analyses to identify obsolete parts. We have less than one year s sales of all product inventories, and our inventories have a low risk of obsolescence because our products are basic construction materials. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 124.5 million, compared with 120.5 million during the same period in fiscal 2024. The 4.0 million increase was primarily related to the higher capital expenditures, most of which were related to the expansion of our Mountain Cement facility. This was partially offset by the lower purchase price for the fiscal 2025 Acquisition, compared with the acquisition completed in fiscal 2024. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities was approximately 182.4 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 160.3 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. The 22.1 million increase was primarily related to increased borrowings of 20.0 million, and lower Proceeds from Stock Option Exercises of 9.3 million. This was partially offset by lower Purchase and Retirement of Common Stock and Dividends Paid of 5.1 million and 0.9 million. 
 31 

Our debt-to-capitalization ratio and net-debt-to-capitalization ratio were 43.1 and 40.8 , respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared with 45.7 and 44.9 , respectively, at March 31, 2024.

2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 
 July 2031 

See Footnote (M) to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company s debt facilities, including interest rate, and financial and other covenants and restrictions. 
 The revolving borrowing capacity of our Revolving Credit Facility is 750.0 million (any revolving loans borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable, the Revolving Loans). The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a swingline loan sublimit of 25.0 million, and a 40.0 million letter of credit facility. At September 30, 2024 we had 155.0 million outstanding of Revolving Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and 10.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in 585.0 million of available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of the outstanding letters of credit. We are contingently liable for performance under 30.0 million in performance bonds relating primarily to our mining operations. We do not have any off-balance sheet debt, or any outstanding debt guarantees. 
 Other than the Revolving Credit Facility, we have no additional source of committed external financing in place. Should the Revolving Credit Facility be terminated, no assurance can be given as to our ability to secure a new source of financing. Consequently, if any balance were outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility at the time of termination, and an alternative source of financing could not be secured, it would have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 We believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, as well as cash on hand, should be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating needs, capital expenditures, and dividend and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including market conditions in the construction industry, our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility, the level of competition, and general and economic factors beyond our control, such as supply chain constraints and inflation. These and other developments could reduce our cash flow or require that we seek additional sources of funding. We cannot predict what effect these factors will have on our future liquidity. See Market Conditions and Outlook section above for further discussion of the possible effects on our business. 
 As market conditions warrant, the Company may from time to time seek to purchase or repay its outstanding debt securities or loans, including the 2.500 Senior Unsecured Notes, Term Loan, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new debt. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in aggregate, may be material. 
 We have approximately 23.7 million of lease liabilities at September 30, 2024, that have an average remaining life of approximately 10.7 years. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends paid were 17.0 million and 17.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, who will continue to evaluate our dividend payment amount on a quarterly basis.

On May 17, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional 7.5 million shares. This authorization brought the cumulative total of Common Stock our Board has approved for repurchase in the open market to 55.9 million shares since we became publicly held in April 1994. Through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 50.6 million shares. 
 Share repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases are determined by management, based on its evaluation of market and economic conditions and other factors. In some cases, repurchases may be made pursuant to plans, programs, or directions established from time to time by the Company s management, including plans intended to comply with the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b5-1. 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company withheld from employees 5,636 shares of stock upon the vesting of Restricted Shares that were granted under the Plan. We withheld these shares to satisfy the employees statutory tax withholding requirements, which is necessary once the Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units are vested.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are expected to range from 280.0 million to 310.0 million and will be allocated across both Heavy Materials and Light Materials sectors. The increase from the prior year reflects our beginning construction of the previously announced modernization and expansion of our Mountain Cement facility. The Mountain Cement construction project will continue through fiscal 2027, with expected completion in late fiscal 2027. These estimated capital expenditures will include maintenance capital expenditures and improvements, as well as other safety and regulatory projects.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain matters discussed in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the context of the statements and generally arise when the Company is discussing its beliefs, estimates or expectations as to future events. These statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance but instead represent only the Company s belief at the time the statements were made regarding future events which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the Company s control. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. The principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company s actual performance include the following: the cyclical and seasonal nature of the Company s businesses; fluctuations in public infrastructure expenditures; the effects of adverse weather conditions on infrastructure and other construction projects as well as our facilities and operations; the fact that our products are commodities and that prices for our products are subject to material fluctuation due to market conditions and other factors beyond our control; the availability of and fluctuations in the cost of raw materials; changes in the costs of energy, including, without limitation, natural gas, coal, and oil (including diesel), and the nature of our obligations to counterparties under energy supply contracts, such as those related to market conditions (for example, spot market prices), governmental orders and other matters; changes in the cost and availability of transportation; unexpected operational difficulties, including unexpected maintenance costs, equipment downtime, and interruption of production; material nonpayment or non-performance by any of our key customers; consolidation of our customers; inability to timely execute announced capacity expansions; difficulties and delays in the development of new business lines; governmental regulation, and changes in governmental and public policy (including, without limitation, climate change and other environmental regulation); possible losses or other adverse outcomes from pending or future litigation or arbitration proceedings; changes in economic conditions or the nature or level of activity in any one or more of the markets or industries in which the Company or its customers are engaged; competition; cyber-attacks or data security breaches, together with the costs of protecting our systems against such incidents and the possible effects thereof on our operations; increases in capacity in the gypsum wallboard and cement industries; changes in the demand for residential housing construction or commercial construction or construction projects undertaken by state or local governments; the availability of acquisitions or other growth opportunities that meet our financial return standards and fit our strategic focus; risks related to pursuit of acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions or the execution or implementation of such transactions, including the integration of operations acquired by the Company; general economic conditions, including inflation and recessionary conditions; and changes in interest rates and the resulting effects on the Company and demand for our products. For example, increases in interest rates, decreases in demand for construction materials, or increases in the cost of energy (including, without limitation, natural gas, coal, and oil) or the cost of our raw materials can be expected to adversely affect the revenue and operating earnings of our operations. In addition, changes in national or regional economic conditions and levels of infrastructure and construction spending could also adversely affect the Company s results of operations. Finally, any forward-looking statements made by the Company are subject to the risks and impacts associated with natural disasters, the outbreak, escalation or resurgence of health emergencies, pandemics or other unforeseen events, including, without limitation, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto designed to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, as well as their impact on our operations and on economic conditions, capital and financial markets. These and other factors are described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, and subsequent quarterly and annual reports upon filing. These reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements made herein are made as of the date hereof, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from expectations expressed herein will increase with the passage of time. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to reflect future events or changes in the Company s expectations.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our Revolving Credit Facility. We have occasionally utilized derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage the debt outstanding that is subject to changes in interest rates. We had a 750.0 million Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024, under which borrowings bear interest at a variable rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the 155.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the 177.5 million of borrowings under the Term Loan at September 30, 2024, would increase interest expense by approximately 3.3 million on an annual basis. At present, we do not utilize derivative financial instruments. 
 We are subject to commodity risk with respect to price changes principally in coal, coke, natural gas, and power. We attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into contracts or increasing our use of alternative fuels. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We have established a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information relating to the Company, which is required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in a timely fashion. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was performed as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

P ART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In February 2023, the EPA published a final rule disapproving the State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for 21 states, which addressed each state s obligations under the 2015 ozone NAAQS to eliminate significant contributions to nonattainment, or interference with maintenance, in downwind states (interstate transport requirements). States subject to a SIP Disapproval under this final action relevant to our cement operations include Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
 In March 2023, the EPA finalized a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP), also known as the Good Neighbor Plan, which addresses interstate transport obligations for the 21 states with disapproved SIPs, as well as two additional states that had not submitted any revisions for their SIPs. The FIP went into effect on August 4, 2023, and requires kilns used in cement and cement product manufacturing in 20 states, including Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, to comply with nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions limitations during the ozone season (May 1 to September 30) beginning in 2026. The FIP has not been implemented in 12 of the states with disapproved SIPs due to legal challenges. In January 2024, the EPA proposed to extend the FIP to five additional states. 
 Our cement plants located in Nevada, Oklahoma, and Texas are most directly affected by EPA s SIP Disapprovals and Good Neighbor Plan. Multiple parties have filed lawsuits challenging the EPA s SIP Disapprovals for 12 states including Nevada, Oklahoma, and Texas. Legal challenges to EPA s SIP Disapprovals for Nevada, Oklahoma, and Texas are all ongoing, and have resulted in stays for each of these disapprovals and prevented implementation of the Good Neighbor Plan in these states. In each of these actions, the petitioners have challenged the failure on the part of the EPA to appropriately defer to the applicable state s analysis and determinations regarding interstate transport obligations. Multiple parties have also filed lawsuits challenging EPA s Good Neighbor Plan, resulting in a stay order by the Supreme Court preventing enforcement nationwide, pending resolution of these challenges. 
 An adverse outcome in these actions resulting in implementation of the Good Neighbor Plan could require us to incur significant capital expenditures related to the installation of additional controls and additional operating costs at the affected facilities or, if the installation of controls proves impracticable, to modify or curtail our operations at such facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on their profitability. Challenges to both the SIP Disapprovals and the Good Neighbor Plan are ongoing in multiple courts, and no court has issued a final ruling on the validity of the disapprovals or the FIP. 
 At this time, we are unable to predict the likely outcome of the multiple legal challenges to both the state disapprovals and the Good Neighbor Plan. Nevertheless, on July 12, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement with the EPA related to our cement operations in Nevada, which agreement provides (i) for the potential installation of additional emissions controls referred to as low NOx burners and (ii) if the controls are installed, that we perform a test-and-set process to determine an appropriate NOx emission limit by February 1, 2027. Assuming such emission limit is finalized and approved by EPA, our Nevada cement operations would no longer be subject to the emissions limit in the Good Neighbor Plan.

Exhibit 10.1 
 
 EAGLE MATERIALS INC. 
 Non-Employee Directors -- Compensation Summary 
 Effective August 2024 to July 2025 
 
 On an annual basis, each non-employee director of Eagle Materials Inc. (the Company may select one of the following compensation packages for his or her performance of director services during the next 12 months: 
 
 (1) 	total annual compensation valued at 230,000, of which 105,000 is paid in cash and the remainder is provided in the form of an equity grant valued at 125,000; or 
 
 (2) 	an equity grant valued at 261,500. 
 
 The grant date value of the equity grant under either alternative is allocated between restricted stock and options to purchase common stock of the Company, par value 0.01 Common Stock (based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee) with respect to each non-employee director. 
 
 In accordance with the terms of the Eagle Materials Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, the exercise price of the stock options is set at the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE on the date of grant. The number of option shares granted is determined as of the date of the grant by using the Black-Scholes method. All options granted to directors in August 2024 have a ten-year term but are subject to vesting requirements, with the options becoming fully vested (exercisable) on the earliest to occur of (i) the one-year anniversary of the date of grant; (ii) the next annual meeting of the Company s stockholders, which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year s annual meeting; (iii) the recipient s retirement from the Board in accordance with the Company s director retirement policy, or earlier under such terms and conditions as approved by the Compensation Committee; (iv) the recipient s disability as determined by the Compensation Committee; or (v) the recipient s death. 
 
 The number of shares of restricted stock is determined as of the date of grant using the closing price of the Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant. The restricted stock granted to directors in August 2024 is subject to vesting requirements, with the shares becoming fully vested (unrestricted) on the earliest to occur of (i) the one-year anniversary of the date of grant; (ii) the next annual meeting of the Company s stockholders, which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year s annual meeting; (iii) the recipient s retirement from the Board in accordance with the Company s director retirement policy, or earlier under such terms and conditions as approved by the Compensation Committee; (iv) the recipient s disability as determined by the Compensation Committee; or (v) the recipient s death. During the restriction period the director will have the right to vote the shares. In addition, upon the vesting of the underlying shares, the director will also be entitled to accrued cash dividends with 

respect to such shares that were paid to holders of Common Stock during the restriction period. 
 
 	Non-employee directors who chair committees of the Board of Directors receive additional annual compensation. The chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee each receive a fee of 20,000 per year. The Chairman of the Board of Directors receives a fee of 125,000 per year. Chairpersons who choose compensation package alternative one (part equity and part cash) receive this additional compensation in the form of cash. Chairpersons who choose compensation package alternative two (all equity) receive this additional compensation in the form of equity, in which case a 30 premium is added to such fees when valuing the equity to be received by such chairperson. 
 
 	In certain prior years, equity grants were in some cases made in the form of restricted stock units RSUs ). In the case of non-employee directors who hold unvested RSUs (which currently only includes Mr. Nicolais), these directors will receive dividend equivalent units as and when the Company issues a cash dividend on the Common Stock, in accordance with the terms of the RSUs. 
 
 All directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses of attending meetings.

Should any provision of the Plan or this Agreement relating to the Shares be determined by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law and the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable. 

11. Interpretive Matters .
