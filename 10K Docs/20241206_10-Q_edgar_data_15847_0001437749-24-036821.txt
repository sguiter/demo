5 Recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation 

Revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. Control transfers either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. 

Aircraft modifications are performed under fixed-price contracts unless modified with a change order. Significant payment terms are generally included in these contracts, requiring a 30 to 50 down payment on arrival of the aircraft and include milestone payments throughout the project. Typically, contracts are less than one year in duration. Revenue from fixed-priced contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the direct labor incurred compared to total estimated direct labor. Direct labor best represents the progress on a contract as it directly correlates to the overall progress on the work to be performed. 

Revenue from Aircraft Avionics and Special Mission Electronics are recognized when shipped. Payment for these Avionics products is due within days of the invoice date after shipment. 

Regarding warranties and returns, our products are special order and are not suitable for return. Our products are unique upon installation and tested prior to their release to the customer and acceptance by the customer. In the rare event of a warranty claim, the claim is processed through the normal course of business and may include additional charges to the customer. In our opinion, any future warranty work would not be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

Gaming revenue is the gross gaming win as reported by the Kansas Lottery casino reporting systems, less the mandated payments by and for the State of Kansas. Electronic games-slots and table games revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses. Liabilities are recognized for chips and "ticket-in, ticket-out" coupons in the customers' possession, and for accruals related to anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Progressive gaming machines, which contain base jackpots that increase at a progressive rate based on the number of coins played, are deducted from revenue as the value of jackpots increase. Effective September 1, 2022, sports wagering became legal in the State of Kansas. The company is currently managing sports wagering through DraftKings sports wagering platform. The Company shares a percentage of the gross sports wagering win with its platform partner. Revenue from Gaming Management and other Corporate/Professional Services is recognized as the service is rendered. Food, beverage, and other revenue is recorded when the service is received and paid.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Butler National is a holding company. Our ability to fund our obligations depends on existing cash on hand, cash flow from our subsidiaries and our ability to raise capital. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our lines of credit and notes payable and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. We assess liquidity in terms of the ability to generate cash or obtain financing in order to fund operating, investing and debt service requirements. Our primary ongoing cash requirements include the funding of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments in line with our business strategy and debt repayment obligations and interest payments. Our strategy has been to maintain moderate leverage and substantial capital resources in order to take advantage of opportunities, to invest in our businesses and develop new streams of income that may be profitable. As such, we have continued to invest in developing and marketing new STCs and growing our casino business including sports wagering. We believe that our current banks will provide the necessary capital for our business operations. However, we continue to maintain contact with other banks that have an interest in funding our working capital needs to continue our growth in operations in 2025 and beyond. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 During the six months ended October 31, 2024 our cash position decreased by 1.6 million. Net income was 5.8 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024. Cash flow provided by operating activities was 5.5 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024. Non-cash activities consisting of depreciation and amortization provided 3.3 million, deferred compensation added 137, and gain on sale of assets used 509. Contract assets increased our cash position by 426. Contract liability increased our cash position by 3.1 million. Inventories decreased our cash position by 928. Accounts receivable increased our cash position by 374. Gaming facility mandated payments decreased our cash position by 62. Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased our cash by 394. Accounts payable decreased our cash position by 2.4 million. Accrued liabilities decreased our cash position by 511. An increase in lease liabilities and other current liabilities increased our cash by 368. Income tax payable decreased our cash position by 3.1 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 3.3 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024. We invested 573 t owards STCs, 2.9 million toward an airplane, an d 181 on buildings and improvements, 1.0 million on equipment and furnishings. Proceeds from the sale of assets provided 1.3 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used by financing activities was 3.9 million for the six months ended October 31, 2024. We made repayments on our debt of 2.4 million. We made repayments on lease right-to-use of 133. We purchased Company stock of 1.4 million. The stock acquired was placed in treasury. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 The Company anticipates remaining capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to be approximately 5.0 million, consisting of 1.3 million on STC's, 1.4 million on buildings and improvements, and 2.3 million on equipment. We anticipate our cash balance will be sufficient to cover our cash requirements through the current fiscal year. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory and long-lived assets. These policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Aerospace Contracts 
 
 Methodology 
 
 We recognize revenue and profit based upon either (1) the percent completion method, in which sales and profit are recorded based upon the ratio of labor costs incurred to date to estimated total labor costs to complete the performance obligation, or (2) the point-in-time method, in which sales are recognized at the time control is transferred to the customer. For aerospace contracts that involve airplane modifications based on customer specific requirements, we generally recognize revenue and income using the percent completion method because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. Revenue is generally recognized using the percent completion method based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses. Our general contract term is between one to twelve months. 
 
 Management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our significant long-term contracts. Based upon these reviews, we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period. If at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue, we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time. 
 
 Judgment and Uncertainties 
 
 The percent completion revenue recognition model requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract. Revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price, with consideration being given to exercised contract options, change orders and, in some cases, projected customer requirements. Contract costs may be incurred over a period of several months, and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers, engineers and financial professionals. Estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections.

Table of Contents 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 
 While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to calculate our revenue contracts and costs, estimating the percentage of work complete on certain programs is a complex task. As a result, changes to these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations. These products and services are an important element in our continuing strategy to increase operating efficiencies and profitability as well as broaden our business base. Management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for these contracts. A significant change in an estimate on one or more of these contracts could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 
 Inventory Valuation 
 
 Methodology 
 
 We have four types of inventory (a) raw materials, (b) contracts in process, (c) other work in process and (d) finished goods. Raw material includes certain general stock materials but primarily relates to purchases that were made in anticipation of specific programs that have not been started as of the balance sheet date. Raw materials are stated at the lower of the cost of the inventory or its fair market value. Contracts in process, other work in process and finished goods are valued at production cost comprised of material, labor and overhead. Contracts in process, other work in process and finished goods are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
 
 Judgment and Uncertainties 
 
 The process for evaluating inventory obsolescence or market value often requires the Company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. We adjust our inventory by the difference between the estimated market value and the actual cost of our inventory to arrive at net realizable value. Changes in estimates of future sales volume may necessitate future write-downs of inventory value. 
 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 
 Management reviews the inventory balance on an annual basis to determine whether any additional write-downs are necessary. Following the write-down of the inventory as discussed above, we believe this inventory is stated at net realizable value at October 31, 2024, although an unanticipated lack of demand for aircraft or spare parts in the future could result in additional write-downs of the inventory value. Overall, management believes that our inventory is appropriately valued at October 31, 2024. 
 
 Long-lived Assets 
 
 Methodology 
 
 The Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." ASC Topic 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. 
 
 Judgment and Uncertainties 
 
 In years that management performs a qualitative assessment we consider the following qualitative factors: general economic conditions in the markets served by the segment, relevant industry-specific performance statistics, and forecasted results of operations. 
 
 For the quantitative impairment tests, management estimated the fair value of the long-lived asset group using an income methodology based on management's estimates of forecasted undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the assets. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our impairment testing. 
 
 An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the assets. No impairment charges were recorded during the six months ended October 31, 2024 . 
 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 
 As with all assumptions, there is an inherent level of uncertainty and actual results, to the extent they differ from those assumptions, could have a material impact on fair value. For example, a reduction in customer demand would impact our assumed growth rate resulting in a reduced fair value. Potential events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value. The loss of a major customer or program could have a significant impact on the future cash flows associated with a long-lived asset group. We do not currently believe there to be a reasonable likelihood that actual results will vary materially from estimates and assumptions used to test our long-lived assets for impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges that could be material. 
 
 Changing Prices and Inflation 
 
 We have experienced upward pressure from inflation in fiscal year 2025. From fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2025 most of the increases we experienced were in material and labor costs. This additional cost may not be transferable to our customers resulting in lower income in the future. We anticipate fuel and labor costs to rise in fiscal 2025 and 2026.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Our principal executive and financial officers have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, based on criteria in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures: Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2024. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Limitations on Controls 
 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: In our opinion there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
