Bionomics Limited 
 Notes to Condensed C onsolidated Financial Statements 
 (Unaudited) 

Bionomics, Inc. 

Liquidity and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had working capital of million, an accumulated deficit of million, and cash and cash equivalents of million. The Company has not generated any product revenues and has not achieved profitable operations. There is no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, and, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. In addition, development activities, clinical and non-clinical testing, and commercialization of the Company s products will require significant additional financing. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, risks related to the successful discovery, development, and commercialization of product candidates, raising additional capital, development of competing drugs and therapies, protection of proprietary technology, and market acceptance of the Company s products. As a result of these and other factors and the related uncertainties, there can be no assurance of the Company s future success. In accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern , the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company incurred net losses of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The Company also used million of cash for operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Based upon the Company s current operating plans, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, combined with its existing ATM facility, will be sufficient to continue funding its development activities into late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which is less than twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Accordingly, based on its recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, the expectation of continued operating losses, and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations, the Company determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months of the issuance date of these financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and assumes the Company will continue as a going concern through the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. The Company plans to address this condition through the sale of ordinary shares in public offerings and/or private placements, debt financings, or through other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all, nor is it considered probable under the accounting standards. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient funding on acceptable terms, it could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all its research and development programs or commercialization activities, which could materially adversely affect its business prospects or its ability to continue operations. Basis of Presentation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP or GAAP and include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2024 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, are unaudited and have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC for interim financial statements.

lease agreement (the Greenhill Lease for its Australian facility located in Dulwich, South Australia. The initial term of the lease expires in May 2026. The Greenhill Lease requires monthly lease payments that are subject to annual increases of throughout the lease term. The lease also includes two renewal options, at the election of the Company, to renew or extend the lease for additional terms of each. These optional periods have not been considered in the determination of the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities associated with these leases as the Company did not consider it reasonably certain it would exercise the options. Variable lease expense for the premises primarily consists of common area maintenance and other operating costs.

 Employee Share Option Plan ESOP and 

 Employee Equity Plan EEP ). 

 Participation in these plans is at our board of directors discretion and no individual has an ongoing contractual right to participate in a plan or to receive any guaranteed benefits. For key appointments, an initial allocation of equity may be offered as a component of their initial employment agreement. The structure of equity awards is under the active review of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to ensure it meets good corporate practice for a company of our size, nature and company lifecycle. The following describes the material terms of each of the plans. Employee Share Plan The objective of the A Plan is to assist Management in the attraction and retention of employees, and to provide encouragement to become shareholders. An annual allocation of up to A of shares may be granted and taxed on a concessional basis. No shares were issued to employees under the A Plan during the three months ended September 30 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Bionomics Employee Equity Plan and Bionomics Employee Share Option Plan The EEP replaced the ESOP at the Annual General Meeting held December 2, 2021. The EEP was last amended on October 31, 2021 to provide the Company with increased flexibility to settle EEP awards offered or granted to non-Australian employees and directors by enabling it to offer and grant EEP awards that may be settled in American Depository Shares ADS (at a number of ADS that represents the appropriate number of Ordinary Shares offered or granted under the award). In addition, the amendment permits the Company to (i) determine any monetary amounts and accept payments related to the EEP or awards issued thereunder in United States dollars (or any other currency the Board deems acceptable), (ii) impose terms and conditions on the EEP or awards issued thereunder to comply with the securities and tax laws of the United States (or any other jurisdiction the Board deems appropriate), and (iii) take any other steps the Board deems necessary or desirable to settle EEP awards in ADSs.

As of September 30, 2024, there was less than million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee share option awards outstanding, which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years. In determining the fair value of the share-based awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized total share-based compensation expense of less than million and million, respectively, substantially all of which was recorded as general and administrative expense in each period. There were equity awards issued during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, respectively.

Item 2. Man agement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 ("Form 10-K") and in this report, as well as disclosures in this report and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, allosteric ion channel modulators designed to transform the lives of patients suffering from serious central nervous system CNS disorders with high unmet medical need. Ion channels serve as important mediators of physiological function in the CNS and the modulation of ion channels influences neurotransmission that leads to downstream signaling in the brain. The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine ACh receptor 7 receptor is an ion channel that plays an important role in driving emotional responses and cognitive performance. Utilizing our expertise in ion channel biology and translational medicine, we are developing orally active small molecule negative allosteric modulators NAMs to treat anxiety and stressor-related disorders. In addition, through a long-standing strategic partnership with Merck Co., Inc., in the United States and Canada MSD ), we are also developing positive allosteric modulators PAMs of the 7 receptor to treat cognitive dysfunction. Bionomics pipeline also includes preclinical assets that target Kv3.1/3.2 and Nav1.7/1.8 ion channels being developed for CNS conditions of high unmet need. 
 We are advancing our lead product candidate, BNC210, an oral, proprietary, selective NAM of the 7 receptor, for the chronic treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD and the acute treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder SAD ). There remains a significant unmet medical need for the over 27 million patients in the United States alone suffering from SAD and PTSD. 
 Current pharmacological treatments include certain antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and there have been no new FDA approved therapies in these indications in nearly two decades. These existing treatments have multiple shortcomings, such as a slow onset of action of antidepressants, and significant side effects of both classes of drugs, including abuse liability, addiction potential and withdrawal symptoms. BNC210 has been observed in our clinical trials to have a fast onset of action and clinical activity without the limiting side effects seen with the current standard of care. 
 We were incorporated in 1996, completed our initial public offering and listing of ordinary shares on the ASX in 1999 and completed our initial public offering and listing of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market in 2021. On July 25, 2023, we requested to be delisted from the official list of the ASX, which became effective August 28, 2023 and, as a result, our ordinary shares are no longer quoted or traded on the ASX. 
 Our ability to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. As of September 30, 2024, our operations have been financed primarily by aggregate net proceeds of 191.5 million from the sale and issuances of our equity, 13.5 million in the form of an upfront payment, research funding and a milestone payment from the 2014 MSD License Agreement, and 66.8 million from Australian research and development credits and government grants and assistance. 
 Since inception, we have had significant operating losses. Our net loss after tax was 0.8 million and 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 178.8 million and cash and cash equivalents of 8.1 million. 
 Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our trade and other payables. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, and our administrative and other expenses will continue to increase. In particular, we expect our expenses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, as well as hire additional personnel, pay fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, and incur other increased costs associated with being a U.S. public company, hiring U.S. personnel and establishing a U.S. infrastructure. In addition, if we seek and obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any product candidate, we will also incur increased expenses in connection with commercialization and marketing of any such product. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditure on other research and development activities. 
 In accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern , the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. The Company incurred net losses of 0.8 million and 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company also used 4.4 million of cash for operating activities during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 13 

Based upon the Company s current operating plans, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, combined with its existing ATM facility, will be sufficient to continue funding its development activities into late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which is less than twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Accordingly, based on its recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, the expectation of continued operating losses, and the need to raise additional capital to finance its future operations, the Company determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months of the issuance date of these financial statements. 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 1, 2024, Bionomics Limited, an Australian corporation Bionomics ), and Neuphoria Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation Neuphoria ), entered into a Scheme Implementation Agreement to re-domicile from Australia to the U.S. state of Delaware pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under Australian law. Upon completion of the Scheme of Arrangement, Bionomics would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuphoria. 
 Under the Scheme of Arrangement: 
 holders of ordinary shares in Bionomics will receive one share of common stock in Neuphoria for every 2,160 ordinary shares of Bionomics held as of record date; and 

holders of American Depositary Shares ADSs of Bionomics will receive one share of common stock in Neuphoria for every 12 ADSs held in Bionomics as of the record date. 

The implementation of the Scheme of Arrangement is subject to customary conditions, including the approval of Bionomics shareholders and an Australian court as well as other regulatory approvals. Details of the terms and conditions are set out in the Scheme Implementation Agreement, which is indexed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Quarterly Report. 
 Licenses and Collaborations 
 In January 2012, we entered into a research and license agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Ironwood ), pursuant to which Ironwood was granted worldwide development and commercialization rights for BNC210. In November 2014, the parties mutually agreed to terminate this license agreement, reverting all rights to BNC210 back to us. The sole obligation to Ironwood is to pay Ironwood low to mid-single digit royalties on the net sales of BNC210, if commercialized. 
 In September 2014, we entered the 2014 MSD License Agreement to develop compounds targeting cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer s disease and other central nervous system conditions. Pursuant to the 2014 MSD License Agreement, we received upfront payments totaling A 20 million, and another A 10 million in February 2017 when the first compound from the collaboration entered Phase 1 clinical trials and we are eligible to receive up to an additional A 465 million in milestone payments for achievement of certain development and commercial milestones. Further, MSD is obligated to pay us tiered royalties in the mid-single digit to low sub-teen double digit percentage range on net sales of the licensed products, subject to reduction upon certain events. 
 In November 2020, we entered into an IP license agreement (the Carina Biotech License with Carina Biotech ("Carina"). Pursuant to the Carina Biotech License, we are eligible to receive approximately 3 million in certain development, regulatory milestone payments if Carina Biotech advances the development of the therapy to a Phase 3 trial. Carina Biotech is also obligated to pay us royalties on its net sales of licensed products, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, ranging from the low single digits to the mid-single digits, subject to certain specified deductions. Royalties are payable until the later of expiration of all licensed patents covering the licensed products, or expiration of all data exclusivity with respect to the licensed product. If Carina Biotech enters into one or more sublicensing agreements relating to the licensed product, we are eligible to receive a percentage of sublicensing revenues. On October 30, 2024, Carina made a milestone payment to the Company in the gross amount of A 1,000,000. 
 Components of Operating Results from Continuing Operations 
 Expenses 
 Our expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and other costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct discovery and development of our proprietary drug candidates and consist primarily of: 
 personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits and share-based compensation; 

expenses incurred under agreements with outside consultants and advisors, including their fees and related travel expenses; and 

14 

expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as CMOs that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform other required manufacturing activities. 

We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred, with development expenses being expensed to the extent they do not meet the criteria for capitalization. To date, we have not capitalized any of our research and development costs and manage our research and development costs on a consolidated basis. Our collaboration partners typically carry the majority of the research and development expenses for out-licensed product candidates at amounts that are not known or made available to us. Therefore, our research and development expenses do not reflect a complete picture of all financial resources devoted to our product candidates, nor do historical research and development expenses necessarily reflect the stage of development for particular product candidates or development projects. 
 Substantially all our direct research and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were on BNC210 and consisted primarily of external costs, such as consultants, CMOs that conduct research and development activities on our behalf, costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials including fees paid to CMOs, and laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials. We deploy our personnel resources across all our research and development activities. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and the current stage of development of our product candidates, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict if, when, or to what extent we will obtain approval and generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including: 
 successful completion of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials in SAD and PTSD; 

successful completion of preclinical studies and of clinical trials for BNC210 and our other current product candidates and any future product candidates; 

data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended patient populations; 

acceptance by the FDA, regulatory authorities in Europe, or other regulatory agencies, of the IND applications, clinical trial applications and/or other regulatory filings for BNC210, our other current product candidates and any future product candidates; 

expansion and maintenance of a workforce of experienced scientists and others to continue to develop our product candidates; 

successful application for and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

obtainment and maintenance of regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishment of, commercial manufacturing capabilities; 

establishment of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and successful launch of commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 

effective competition with other therapies; 

obtainment and maintenance of coverage, adequate pricing and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors; 

obtainment, maintenance, enforcement, defense and protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; 

avoidance of infringement, misappropriation or other violations with respect to others intellectual property or proprietary rights; and 

maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following receipt of any marketing approvals. 

We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these factors could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our current and future preclinical and clinical product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the 
 15 

completion of clinical development, or if we experience significant delays in execution of or enrollment in any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of preclinical and clinical development. 
 Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to implement our business strategy, which includes advancing BNC210 through clinical development and other product candidates into clinical development, expanding our research and development efforts, including hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts, and seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our product candidates advance into later stages of clinical development. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. The process of conducting the necessary clinical development to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. 
 General and Administration Expenses 
 We expect our general and administration expenses to increase over the next several years to support expanded research and development activities and operating as a U.S. public company, including costs of additional personnel, increased costs related to additional investor relations activities, director and officer insurance premiums, and increased fees to outside consultants, lawyers, and accountants. 
 Our general and administration expenses consist primarily of: 
 personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits and share-based compensation; 

expenses incurred under agreements with outside consultants and advisors, including their fees and related travel expenses; 

filing and maintenance of patents and intellectual property rights; 

costs relating to audit, tax and regulatory compliance; and 

other expenses, including facilities costs, legal fees and insurance. 

Other Income 
 Other income consists of net interest income, foreign currency gains and losses, fair value adjustments, and other gains and losses. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange 
 Our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. A substantial portion of our operating expenses and other income are denominated in the Australian dollar. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we managed our exchange rate exposure principally by maintaining foreign currency cash accounts and managing our payments from the most appropriate accounts. From time to time, we may additionally use forward exchange contracts in an effort to manage certain foreign exchange rate exposures when appropriate. There were no foreign exchange contracts used during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were principally focused on the advancement of BNC210. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 1.2 million, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to decreased expenditures associated with the PTSD ATTUNE clinical trial, which started during July 2021, the SAD PREVAIL clinical trial, which started during February 2022, and work in relation to preparation for an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss our Phase 3 clinical program in SAD. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 67 of the total research and development expenses related to the advancement of our BNC210-based programs. Of the total BNC210-based program spend during the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 18 was attributable to PSTD ATTUNE and 49 to SAD Prevail. We do not track labor associated with each program and have allocated headcount costs on a pro-rated basis. Management believes the pro rata allocation results in a reasonable estimate of the headcount costs associated with each of the programs noted above. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The 0.7 million decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period ended in 2023 was due to decreases in headcount-related costs of 0.1 million resulting from normal turnover in personnel, decreased insurance expense in the current year of 0.2 million, and decreased administrative costs associated with our delisting from the ASX of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income 
 The net increase in other income of 2.7 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period ending in 2023, was primarily due to the fair value adjustment associated with our accompanying warrant liability of 2.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of approximately 0.1 million combined with losses on foreign currency transactions of approximately 0.3 million. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the three months ended September 30, 2024, nor we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and we anticipate that we will incur net losses for the next several years. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 8.1 million and an accumulated deficit of 178.8 million. 
 The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:

Operating Activities 
 The net cash used in operating activities for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 4.4 million. The 4.6 million decrease in net loss combined with the 0.2 million effect of the remeasurement of intercompany accounts during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, was offset by a 0.1 million decrease in share based compensation combined with the realization of a 2.9 million change in the fair value of the accompanying warrants and a 1.7 million increase in cash used for working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 There were no transactions categorized as investing activities during either of the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 17 

Financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 represent trailing equity issue costs associated with our June 2024 offering of ADS shares, pre-funded ADS warrants, partially offset by the exercise of pre-funded ADS warrants. 
 Financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2023 represent the issuance of ADS shares, net of a stock subscription receivable of 5.6 million and issue costs of 0.5 million. Cash proceeds of 5.6 million were received on October 3, 2023 in full satisfaction of the stock subscription receivable. 
 In May 2023, the Company announced the establishment of an at-the-market program (the ATM Program with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor as sales agent. Under the ATM Program, the Company may offer and sell up to 11.5 million of ordinary shares in the form of ADSs, with each ADS representing 180 fully paid ordinary shares, through Cantor. Sales of ADSs under the ATM Program may be made from time to time, with the timing and amount of any sales to be determined by Bionomics based on a variety of factors. Bionomics may determine to sell some, all, or none of the ADSs under the ATM Program and may terminate the ATM Program at its discretion. Bionomics, through Cantor, may sell ADSs by any lawful method deemed to be an at-the-market offering . Sales made through the ATM Program may be made at market prices prevailing at the time of a sale or at prices related to prevailing market prices. As a result, actual sales prices may vary. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM, together with its existing cash and cash equivalents, to fund our pipeline development, to maintain working capital, and for general corporate purposes. We have not issued any ADSs under the ATM program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Any product candidates we may develop may never achieve commercialization and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our research and development expenses and our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses (including share-based compensation); costs related to third-party clinical research, non-clinical research, manufacturing and development services; costs relating to the build-out of our headquarters and other offices; license payments or milestone obligations that may arise; legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. 
 Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, combined with our existing ATM facility, will be sufficient to continue funding our development activities through late in the first quarter of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. To finance our operations beyond that point we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will continue to require additional financing to advance our current product candidates through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to seek funds through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders, will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our shareholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities to reduce costs. 
 Further, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated product development programs. 
 If we were unable to obtain additional financing to fund our operations through successful development and commercialization of all our potential product candidates, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay, or terminate some or all of our planned development and commercialization activities, which could harm our business. For more information as to the risks associated with our future funding requirements, see Risk Factors. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We do not have any long-term debt or capital lease obligations. We have a long-term operating lease obligation for our Australian office space and a non-current warrant liability which commits us to issuing shares to accompanying warrant holders upon the exercise of their ADS warrants.

 Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements 
 Sales of ADSs issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and other derivative securities could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. 
 If we issue warrants, then such warrants will entitle the holder to receive additional securities from us, diluting your ownership interest. For example, in the private placement offering we consummated on June 3, 2024, the warrants issued in the first tranche of that offering entitles the investor to purchase up to 18,932,477 ADSs, of which 6,279,905 have been issued as of the date of this quarterly report. The sale of additional ADSs, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline or become more volatile. 
 Sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares or ADSs by significant existing shareholders in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the trading price of our ordinary shares and ADSs. 
 Sales of a substantial number of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could significantly reduce the market price of our ADSs and impair our ability to raise adequate capital. 
 In particular, on May 31, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. Armistice pursuant to which Bionomics agreed to issue and sell in a three-tranche private placement a certain number of restricted ADSs, a pre-funded warrant to purchase ADSs and an accompanying 5-year cash purchase warrant. 
 The first tranche of the private placement involved the issuance of 1,296,486 ADSs and a Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase up to 6,279,905 ADSs as well as an Accompanying Warrant to purchase up to 12,652,572 ADSs at an exercise price of US 0.99 per ADS (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof). Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Warrants, Armistice may not beneficially own more than 9.9 of our outstanding ordinary shares at any one time. Since July 1, 2024, all of the first tranche Pre-Funded Warrant have been exercised and 6,279,905 ADS have been issued thereunder. 
 The second tranche of the private placement is subject to the satisfaction of regulatory milestones that, if achieved, would involve the purchase by Armistice of up to an additional US 25.0 million of ADSs (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) from Bionomics at US 0.99 per ADS. The second tranche milestones are the earlier of (i) receipt of formal written correspondence by Bionomics from the FDA following planned interactions with the FDA regarding the outcomes of the end-of-phase meeting 2 and breakthrough designation status for BNC210 for PTSD or (ii) December 31, 2024. In September 2024, the FDA rejected our initial application for breakthrough designation and, as a result, we believe it is unlikely that the second tranche will be exercised by or before its expiration on December 31, 2024. 
 The third tranche of the private placement is subject to the satisfaction of regulatory milestones that, if achieved, would involve the purchase by Armistice of up to an additional US 25.0 million of ADSs (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) from Bionomics at US 0.99 per ADS. The third tranche milestones are the latter of (i) completion of an interim blinded safety review of the planned BNC210 Phase-3 PTSD study or (ii) December 31, 2025. 
 The Accompanying Warrant is immediately exercisable and remains exercisable until June 2, 2029. However, Armistice may not exercise the Accompanying Warrant to the extent such exercise would cause it to beneficially own a number of ordinary shares that would exceed 4.99 of our then outstanding ordinary shares following such exercise. 
 ADS holders may be subject to additional risks related to holding ADSs rather than ordinary shares, and we may incur significant costs related to our Depositary Agreement for the ADSs. 
 ADS holders do not hold ordinary shares directly and, as such, are subject to, among others, the following additional risks: 
 20 

we do not treat our ADS holders as one of our shareholders and they are not able to exercise shareholder rights, except through the American Depositary Receipt ADR depositary as permitted by the deposit agreement; 
 	distributions on the ordinary shares represented by our ADSs will be paid to the ADR depositary, and before the ADR depositary makes a distribution to ADS holders on behalf of their held ADSs, any withholding taxes that must be paid will be deducted. Additionally, if the exchange rate fluctuates during a time when the ADR depositary cannot convert the foreign currency, ADS holders may lose some or all of the value of the distribution; and 
 	we and the ADR depositary may amend or terminate the deposit agreement without the ADS holders consent in a manner that could prejudice ADS holders. 
 Additionally, under our Depositary Agreement with Citibank N.A., as the depositary for the ADSs, we have and will continue to incur significant costs related to the program through which the ADSs are issued, both in restricted and unrestricted form, and such fees are incurred on a per ADS basis; therefore, the greater the amount of ADSs issued, the greater our costs will be for such issuances. As a result of the June 4, 2024 private placement offering of ADS and complete exercise of the pre-funded warrants issued and exercised thereunder, we have paid Citibank significant fees in the aggregate in connection with such offering. Until we no longer are required to issue ADSs, and are able to issue shares of common stock as a domestic U.S. company, then we will continue to incur additional fees and other related costs and expenses. Even if we terminate the Depositary Agreement with Citibank, we may be required to pay significant additional fees for the withdrawal or termination of this program.
