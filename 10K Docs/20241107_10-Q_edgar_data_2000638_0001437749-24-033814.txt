On June 24, 2024, the Trust purchased approximately ether with the proceeds of the Seed Creation Baskets using Coinbase Inc. (the Prime Execution Agent ). The costs incurred in connection with the purchase of ether with the proceeds of the Seed Creation Baskets were borne by the Trust. The Sponsor s fee started accruing daily at an annualized rate equal to of the net asset value of the Trust on June 24, 2024. 
 
 The Trust s registration statement on Form S- 1 relating to its continuous public offering of Shares was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on July 22, 2024 Effective Date) and the Shares were listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC NASDAQ on July 23, 2024. 
 
 The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in ether. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10 -Q and the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements, have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. 
 
 The Trust qualifies as an investment company solely for accounting purposes and not for any other purpose and follows the accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, but is not registered, and is not required to be registered, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

The Sponsor has the exclusive authority to determine the Trust s net asset value, which it has delegated to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has delegated to the Trust Administrator the responsibility to calculate the net asset value of the Trust and the net asset value per Share NAV ), based on a pricing source selected by the Trustee. In determining the Trust s net asset value, the Trust Administrator values the ether held by the Trust based on an index (the Index ), unless the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines that the Index is unreliable. The methodology used to calculate the Index price to value ether in determining the net asset value of the Trust may not be deemed consistent with U.S. GAAP. The CME CF Ether Dollar Reference Rate New York Variant for the ether U.S. Dollar trading pair (the CF Benchmarks Index shall constitute the Index, unless the CF Benchmarks Index is not available or the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines the CF Benchmarks Index is unreliable as the Index and therefore determines not to use the CF Benchmarks Index as the Index. If the CF Benchmarks Index is not available or the Sponsor determines, in its sole discretion, that the CF Benchmarks Index is unreliable (together a Fair Value Event ), the Trust s holdings may be fair valued on a temporary basis in accordance with the fair value policies approved by the Trustee. 
 
 Additionally, the Trust Administrator monitors for unusual prices and escalates to the Trustee if detected. If the CF Benchmarks Index is not used, the Trust will notify Shareholders in a prospectus supplement, in its periodic Exchange Act reports and/or on the Trust s website. The Trust Administrator calculates the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV once on each day other than a Saturday or a Sunday, or a day on which NASDAQ is closed for regular trading (a Business Day ). The NAV for a normal trading day will be released after 4:00 p.m. ET. Trading during the core trading session on NASDAQ typically closes at 4:00 p.m. ET. However, NAVs are not officially released until after the completion of a comprehensive review of the NAV and prices utilized to determine the NAV of the Trust by the Trust Administrator. Upon the completion of the end of day reviews by the Trust Administrator the NAV is released to the public typically by 5:30 p.m. ET and generally no later than 8:00 p.m. ET. The period between 4:00 p.m. ET and the NAV release after 5:30 p.m. ET (or later) provides an opportunity for the Trust Administrator and the Trustee to detect, flag, investigate, and correct unusual pricing should it occur and implement a Fair Value Event, if necessary. Any such correction could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 
 
 The Trust s periodic financial statements may not utilize net asset value of the Trust to the extent the methodology used to calculate the Index is deemed not to be consistent with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Gain or loss on sales of ether is calculated on a trade date basis using the average cost method.

 The Trust s net asset value increased from 10,589,875 at June 30, 2024 to 1,019,342,543 at September 30, 2024. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 400,000 Shares at June 30, 2024 to 51,200,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, a consequence of 50,800,000 Shares (1,270 Baskets) being created. The increase in the Trust s net asset value was partially offset by a decrease in the price of ether, which fell 24.78 from 3,494.31 at June 30, 2024 to 2,628.44 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The 24.78 decrease in the NAV for purposes of the Trust s periodic financial statements (the Financial Statement NAV from 26.47 at June 30, 2024 to 19.91 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 24.78 decrease in the price of ether. 
 
 The NAV of 26.70 on July 19, 2024 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low during the quarter of 16.85 on September 6, 2024. 
 
 Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 138,702,639, resulting from an unrealized loss on investment in ether of 138,509,122, a net investment loss of 171,857, and a net realized loss of 21,660 from ether sold to pay expenses.

 The 20.36 decrease in the NAV for purposes of the Financial Statement NAV from 25.00 at May 21, 2024 (Date of Seeding) to 19.91 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 20.34 decrease in the price of ether. The Financial Statement NAV decreased slightly more than the price of ether on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fee, which was 172,277 for the period, or 0.04 of the Trust s average weighted assets of 405,270,976 during the period. 
 
 The NAV of 26.70 on July 19, 2024 was the highest during the period, compared with a low during the period of 16.85 on September 6, 2024.
