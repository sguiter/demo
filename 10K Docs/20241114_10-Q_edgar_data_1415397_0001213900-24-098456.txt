Overview 

We are a pharmaceutical drug
research and development company focused on the discovery and clinical development of life-improving drug therapies based on cannabinoids,
including cannabidiol, or CBD. Unless indicated otherwise, we plan on using oil derived from CBD strains with low levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol,
or THC. All references to the use of CBD in our product candidates refer to CBD strains with less than 0.3 of THC. 

We are currently in the pre-clinical
development stage for our lead product candidate, our RA product candidate for the treatment of RA. In addition, we are aiming to develop
a pharmaceutical drug product for the treatment of hyperinflammatory syndrome and lung inflammation related to COVID-19. At Rambam Health
Care Campus, or Rambam Hospital, we have successfully completed preclinical studies on human-derived immune cells and mouse models for
both the COVID-19 and RA products. 

In November 2022, we submitted
a proposal to the Ministry of Health of Israel, or MOH for a clinical trial of a cannabis-based drug intended to alleviate the deterioration
of COVID-19 patients. 

On February 9, 2022, we filed
an application for a clinical trial with the Medical Cannabis Unit of the Ministry of Health of Israel, or MOH. On February 16, 2022 we
submitted an application with the Helsinki Committee at Rambam Hospital for a clinical trial in COVID-19 patients. 

On March 27, 2023, the Israel
Ministry of Health, or MOH, accepted our proposal for a clinical trial aimed at preventing the deterioration of hospitalized COVID-19
patients. 

In April 2024 we began a proof-of-concept
clinical trial in the United States, leveraging insights from the pre-clinical experiments it has conducted at the Rambam Hospital. This
proof-of-concept clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of Cannabigerol in patients with active RA. The estimated timeline to finalize
such proof-of-concept clinical trial is six months from the recruitment of the first participant. 

We have engaged with MindMate,
Inc./ dba Citruslabs Citruslabs to oversee such proof-of-concept clinical trial. Our collaboration with Citruslab underscores
our dedication to conducting such proof-of-concept clinical trial in accordance with applicable industry standards and regulations, including
the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and dedication to bringing treatments to fruition and
improving the lives of individuals affected by RA. This milestone represents a significant stride forward in our mission to pioneer innovative
solutions for managing RA and underscores its commitment to driving advancements in medical research, addressing the unmet needs of patients. 

2 

As we move forward, our focus
will be on further investigating and refining the formula through continued pre-clinical research. Our goal is to ensure that the formula
meets all the necessary standards and regulations set forth by the FDA, allowing us to progress towards clinical treatments. 

Our vision is to emerge as
a pioneering company at the forefront of formulating pharmaceutical drugs that harness the potential of purified cannabinoids and full-spectrum
CBD oil. Our primary mission is to cater to the unmet medical requirements of patients grappling with various disorders, with a particular
focus on conditions linked to inflammation, such as chronic lung inflammation, RA and COVID-19. 

By leveraging our expertise
in this field, we are committed to providing innovative solutions to improve the lives of those afflicted with these challenging medical
conditions. Through our dedication to research, development, and compassionate care, we aim to contribute significantly to the well-being
of patients worldwide, offering them much-needed relief and hope for a better future. 

In order to achieve our goal,
we have and will continue to build an experienced team of senior executives and scientists, with experience in all facets of pharmaceutical
research and development, drug formulation, clinical trial execution and regulatory submissions. We intend to leverage the knowledge of
our team in order to complete the clinical trials needed to receive approvals of our product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities. 

Initially, we intend to obtain
approvals for our product candidates from the FDA and the Medical Cannabis Unit of the Israeli Ministry of Health, or MOH. Upon obtaining
FDA approvals, or in the event that we are not successful in obtaining such approvals, we intend to apply for EMA and other countries 
governmental regulatory agencies approvals for our product candidates. If we are successful in obtaining FDA approvals for our product
candidates, we intend to enter into royalty agreements with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, approved medical manufactures and distributors,
having them using our medical formulas for the purpose of growing, cultivating, manufacturing, and distributing Raphael Pharmaceutical
medical indications in their designated territories. 

For this purpose, in October
2022, we entered into an agreement with the Medical Cannabis Research Center at Rambam Health Care Campus, and Rambam MedTech for the
development of a new, patentable formulation that combines purified cannabinoids to treat rheumatoid diseases. 

The overall objective of this
study is to identify a novel cannabinoid based patentable formulation to treat Rheumatoid diseases. Specifically, to investigate combination
of purified cannabinoids to downregulate inflammation related to Rheumatoid diseases. We propose to base our study on data derived from
Dr. Igal Louria-Hayon s studies (Helsinki # 0442-20-RMB) on the evaluation of the immune regulation properties of cannabinoids on
the immune system and the data derived from the cannabinoids receptors study (Helsinki # 0331-20-RMB). We will analyze the activation
of cannabinoid receptors on mouse models and will study the role of purified cannabinoid as a potential to develop a novel patentable
formulation to treat RA. 

Our discovery platform currently
focuses the use of CBD oil, one of the cannabinoids in cannabis plants, as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for our RA product
candidate and COVID-19 product candidate. Research results published in 2018 Translational Investigation of the Therapeutic Potential
of Cannabidiol (CBD): Toward a New Age has shown that there may be benefits to treading medical conditions, or their effects,
with cannabinoids, and more specifically, with CBD, which may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity,
reducing inflammation and interacting with neurotransmitters. This research has also shown that CBD may have neuroprotective properties,
and could have the ability to (i) reduce anxiety and depression, (ii) alleviate cancer-related symptoms, (iii) reduce acne and (iv) benefit
heart health. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are no critical accounting estimates for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. Also,
please see Note 2 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting policies.

for the corresponding period in 2023. The 645,000 decrease in the net cash used in operating activities during the nine months period
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in Company s net loss for the period
in the amount of 282,000 and an increase in account payables and related party of 344,000. 

There was no net cash used
in investing activities for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and for the same period in 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 was 280,000 compared to 1,126,000 for the same period in 2023. The decrease
in net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period
in 2023 was mainly due to a decrease in funds received from issuance of shares and warrants and proceeds received from exercise of warrants.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Rambam Research Agreement 

On July 17, 2019, we entered
into a sponsored research agreement, or the Research Agreement, with Rambam MT, pursuant to which the Company agreed to fund a research
project, to be performed by Rambam MD, with a research plan aimed at identifying the effects of different cannabis strains on the function
of immune cells. On October 28, 2020, the Company and Rambam MT agreed to expand the research plan to study the anti-inflammatory activities
of cannabis extracts in an RA mouse model. On February 15, 2021, the Company and Rambam MT agreed to further expand the research plan
to study the effect of cannabis extracts on the immunopathology of the COVID-19 disease. The Sponsored Researched Agreement is for an
initial term of 48 months. On October 23, 2022, the Company and Rambam MT entered into a supplement to the Research Agreement, or the
Supplement Agreement, pursuant to which the Company exercised an option to extend the Research Agreement by additional two years until
December 31, 2024. 

Pursuant to the Research Agreement,
we agreed to pay Rambam MT 1.4 million in four equal payments, due on the first day of August on each successive year from 2019 through
2022. Pursuant to the Supplement Agreement, we agreed to pay Rambam MT 960,000 plus VAT in four biannual payments from May 2023 through
December 2024. Furthermore, in accordance with the terms of the Research Agreement, we and Rambam MT will have joint ownership of any
intellectual property (IP) created as a result of research programs covered by such agreement. In connection with the Research Agreement,
Rambam MT agreed not to work, study or develop any technologies with other entities that compete with our work with Rambam MT for our
COVID-19 product candidate or RA product candidate for a term of three and seven years, respectively, from the end of the parties 
collaboration with respect to the COVID-19 product candidate and seven years from the end of the term of the Research Agreement with respect
to the RA product candidate. 

Subject to commercial sales
of any product candidate using the IP created as a part of the research covered by such agreement, Raphael Israel is required to pay Rambam
MT a royalty in an amount equal to 6 of all net sales, subject to certain deductions, such as taxes paid by any purchaser, transportation
and shipping costs, and other customary deductions. 

On December 25, 2023, the
Company received an extension to pay the remaining 350,000 pursuant to the Research Agreement until the end of June 2024. As of May 15,
2024, the Company has made all four of the four equal payments due pursuant to the Research Agreement, for a total amount of 1.4 million
and 120,000 for the Supplement Agreement. 

Way of Life Cannabis Agreement 

In October 2020, Raphael Israel
entered into an engagement agreement with Wolc, pursuant to which, subject to its completing the Share Exchange with Easy Energy, Raphael
Israel will be provided with up to 15 liters of CBD oil, from a strain of cannabis during a term of 18 months, to be provided in two to
three deliveries of between one to seven milliliters of CBD oil. In accordance with Raphael Israel s agreement with Wolc, Raphael
Israel has agreed to issue to certain persons affiliated with Wolc 3 of Raphael s issued and outstanding share capital as of the
date of the Share Exchange, to be provided in three equal issuances; provided, however, that such persons may elect to receive a cash
payment of 100,000 instead of any one issuance of Raphael s shares. In addition to the issuance of shares, Raphael Israel has also
agreed to pay Wolc a royalty fee equal to 15 of the net royalties generated from sales of Raphael Israel s pharmaceutical drug
products that are developed at Rambam hospital in Israel. 

5 

On July 27, 2022, we issued
100,500 shares of common stock to Wolc in connection with the engagement agreement. The value of such issued shares was based on the value
of the service provided, which amounted to 100,000. In June 2023, we issued the remaining 201,000 shares of common stock to Wolc in connection
with the services agreement dated October 2020.The value of the shares issued was based on the value of the service provided, which amounted
to 200,000. 

Except for the above, we have
not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose
entities or variable interest entities. 

We do not believe that our
off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to investors. 

Current Outlook 

We have financed our operations
to date primarily through proceeds from our founder s capital and issuance of shares and warrants. We have incurred losses and generated
negative cash flows from operations since inception. To date we have not generated revenue, and we do not expect to generate significant
revenues from the sale of our products in the near future. 

We do not believe that our
current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements. This raises substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. At this time, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financial resources
required for the short and long-term support of our operations or that we will be able to obtain additional financing as needed, or meet
the conditions of such financing, or that the costs of such financing may not be prohibitive. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period within one year from the date of the financial statements included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report. 

As of September 30, 2024,
our cash and cash equivalents were 40,000. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our
projected cash requirements through the end of the year. Therefore, we will require significant additional financing in the near future
to fund our operations. We currently anticipate that we will require approximately 0.8 million for research and development activities
over the course of the next 12 months. We also anticipate that we will require approximately 0.6 million for capital expenditures over
such 12-month period, which consists primarily of expenditures for clinical trials and general Company operating costs. 

In addition, our operating
plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than
planned. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

our research and development efforts, including our ability to finish research and development projects or product development within the allotted or expected timeline; 

the cost, timing and outcomes of seeking to commercialize our products in a timely manner; 

our ability to generate cash flows; 

economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

Until we can generate significant
revenues, if ever, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits, loans,
or debt or equity financings. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If
funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development plans for, or commercialization
efforts with respect to, one or more applications of our products. This may raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as
a going concern.

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024,
we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and participation of management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures.
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Based upon this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable
assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Because of inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even internal controls determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in
decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. The projection
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies may deteriorate. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that
any system of internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material
information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. 

This Quarterly Report does
not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of
the Commission that exempt from this requirement issuers that are neither accelerated filers nor large accelerated filers.
