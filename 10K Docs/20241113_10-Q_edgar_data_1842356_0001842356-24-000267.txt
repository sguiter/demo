 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 Pursuant to the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date these financial statements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management's plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within control of the Company as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management's plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and accounts receivable of million, and the amount outstanding under its debt obligations was million, of which million and million related to the Financing Agreement and PPP Loan, respectively. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was million and net cash used in operating activities was million. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate significant cash flows, obtain sufficient proceeds from any future offerings of securities, renegotiate the existing terms of the Financing Agreement, and/or obtain alternative financing prior to the maturity of the Financing Agreement in August 2025. The Company expects operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future as it continues to invest in growing its business. To alleviate these conditions, the Company completed a registered public offering of common stock in July 2024 for net proceeds of approximately million (See Note 9, Stockholders Equity (Deficit) , for more information) and management is actively engaged in discussions to refinance the Financing Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the refinancing as it is ultimately outside of the control of the Company.

 million for ownership in a new limited liability company, which was funded in the first quarter of 2023. The investment was accounted for as an equity method investment, with the Company s proportionate share of the investee s net income recognized in equity in net earnings of equity method investment within the Company s consolidated statement of operations, as the Company had less than 50 ownership and did not control the entity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize any activity within its condensed consolidated statements of operations related to the equity method investee. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company acquired the remaining ownership of the limited liability company for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition using the cost accumulation model to determine the cost to be allocated to the assets acquired, which resulted in the derecognition of royalties payable to the equity method investee of approximately million and the recognition of intangible assets acquired of approximately million and cash acquired of million. As a result of the transaction, the limited liability company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company began consolidating the entity as part of its condensed consolidated financial statements.

 and shares of Wag! common stock, respectively. The Earnout Shares will be issued only if certain Wag! share price conditions are met over a period from the Merger Date. The Earnout Shares are subject to the occurrence of certain triggering events based on a period from the Merger Date as defined in the CHW Business Combination Agreement as: 
 1. shares are earned if the stock price of the Company is or exceeds for out of any consecutive trading days Triggering Event I 
 2. shares are earned if the stock price of the Company is or exceeds for out of any consecutive trading days Triggering Event II and 
 3. shares are earned if the stock price of the Company is or exceeds for out of any consecutive trading days Triggering Event III (collectively, the Triggering Events ). 
 Additionally, if there is a change of control transaction, the agreed upon selling price of the Company on a per share basis, would be the fair value of the shares inclusive of the resulting triggered Earnout Shares upon consummation of the proposed transaction. The per share price in a change in control would be used to determine whether the Triggering Events have been met, and depending on the per share price, a certain number of shares will be issued. 
 The Earnout Shares and Management Earnout Shares are classified as equity transactions at initial issuance and at settlement when and if the triggering conditions are met. The Earnout Shares are equity-classified since they do not meet the liability classification criteria outlined in FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and are both (i) indexed to the Company s own shares and (ii) meet the criteria for equity classification. Until the shares are issued upon a Triggering Event, the Earnout Shares are not included in shares outstanding. As of the date of the CHW Business Combination, the Earnout Share awards had a total fair value of million determined using a Monte Carlo fair value methodology in each of the , , and Earnout tranches multiplied by the number of Earnout Shares allocated to each individual pursuant to the calculation defined in the CHW Business Combination Agreement.

 million in unemployment insurance contributions for its independent contractors. In April 2022, the California Employment Development Department ("CA EDD") initiated a routine employment tax audit of the Company and alleges the Company owes approximately million in additional unemployment insurance contributions for its independent contractors. The Company is engaged in ongoing discussions with the CA EDD and intends to defend itself vigorously in this pending matter.

 Prior to the Merger, CHW issued of Public Warrants and of Private Warrants (together, the Warrants in connection with its initial public offering to CHW Acquisition Sponsor LLC, the sponsor of CHW. After consummation of the Merger on August 9, 2022, the Private Warrants held by the Sponsor were exchanged for warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company issuable upon the exercise of Private Placement Warrants originally issued to CHW and the shares of common stock that are issuable upon the exercise of Public Warrants remained outstanding. Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase share of common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment, at any time commencing on September 8, 2022, which was the later of days after the completion of the CHW Business Combination or months from CHW's IPO closing date. The Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the CHW Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 The Company may call the Warrants for redemption: 
 in whole or in part; 
 at a price of per warrant; 
 upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption; and

 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share consolidations, share capitalizations, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 If the Company calls the Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the public warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. 
 The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrants. 
 Management has concluded that the Warrants issued pursuant to the CHW IPO qualify for equity classification.

 Key Operating and Financial Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We regularly review several metrics, including the following key financial metrics and non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. These key financial metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are set forth below for the periods presented:

 Comparisons between positive and negative numbers are not meaningful. 
 (1) Adjusted EBITDA (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (loss) margin are non-GAAP measures which may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. See below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (loss) to net loss. 
 Platform Participants 
 A Platform Participant is defined as a Pet Parent or Pet Caregiver who transacted on the Wag! platform for a service in the quarter. Services include dog walking, sitting, boarding, drop-ins, training, premium telehealth services, wellness plans, and pet insurance plan comparison. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA (loss) means net loss adjusted to exclude, where applicable in a given period, interest expense, net; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; integration and transaction costs associated with acquired businesses; severance costs; loss on extinguishment of debt; and legal settlements. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) margin represents Adjusted EBITDA (loss) divided by revenues. We use Adjusted EBITDA (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (loss) margin, which are both non-GAAP metrics, to evaluate and assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (loss) margin, when taken collectively with our U.S. GAAP results, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results.

Table of Contents 

 Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under U.S. GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense as a result of a decrease in the amount outstanding under the Financing Agreement. 
 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 0.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to a 5.0 million prepayment of the Financing Agreement during the third quarter of 2024 (See Note 7, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 1.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to prepayments of 10.0 million of the Financing Agreement during 2024 (See Note 7, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically generated negative cash flows from operations and have primarily financed our operations through private and public sales of equity securities and debt. In July 2024, we issued and sold an aggregate of 7.4 million shares of common stock at a price of 1.35 per share in a registered public offering. The aggregate net proceeds were approximately 8.6 million, after deducting offering costs of 0.8 million and underwriting discounts and commissions of 0.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 8.4 million. 
 We expect operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in growing our business. Our primary uses of cash include operating costs such as product and technology expenses, marketing expenses, personnel expenses and other expenditures necessary to support our operations and our growth.

 Pursuant to the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date these financial statements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management's plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within our control as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management's plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 8.4 million and accounts receivable of 6.5 million, and the amount outstanding under our debt obligations was 20.7 million, of which 20.3 million and 0.4 million related to the Financing Agreement and PPP Loan, respectively. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 12.8 million and net cash used in operating activities was 5.3 million. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate significant cash flows, obtain sufficient proceeds from any future offerings of securities, renegotiate the existing terms of the Financing Agreement, and/or obtain alternative financing prior to the maturity of the Financing Agreement in August 2025. We expect operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in growing our business. To alleviate these conditions, we completed a registered public offering of common stock in July 2024 for net proceeds of approximately 8.6 million (See Note 9, Stockholders Equity (Deficit) , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information) and management is actively engaged in discussions to refinance the Financing Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the refinancing as it is ultimately outside of our control. 
 Due to our projected cash needs (which includes amounts due under the Financing Agreement) combined with our current liquidity level and history of net losses and cash used to fund operating activities, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to grow our revenue and the impact of the factors described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our 2023 10-K. We may seek additional equity or debt financing. See the section titled Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Operations We may require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all within the 2023 10-K.

 Changes in Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.3 million, an increase of 0.7 million from 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 1.0 million of unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in net loss excluding non-cash and reconciling items disclosed within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. The 1.0 million of unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities, partially offset by favorable changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and deferred revenue. The 0.4 million decrease in net loss excluding non-cash and reconciling items was primarily driven by lower costs and expenses and favorable changes in non-cash and reconciling items including stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower revenues. 
 Changes in Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.4 million, a decrease of 9.3 million from 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 9.0 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and a 1.5 million decrease in cash paid for equity method investments, partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. 
 Changes in Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.2 million, an increase of 1.8 million from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 10.3 million increase in repayment of debt related to prepayments of 10.0 million prepayment of the Financing Agreement during 2024 (See Note 7, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), partially offset by a 8.6 million increase in proceeds from registered public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs (See Note 9, Stockholders Equity (Deficit) , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 
 Paycheck Protection Program Loan 
 On August 5, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds of approximately 5.1 million from a financial institution pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, of which 3.5 million was subsequently forgiven. The PPP Loan matures on August 5, 2025 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.00 . Principal and interest payments are payable monthly, and as of September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding under the PPP Loan was 0.4 million. 
 For additional information regarding the PPP Loan, refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Blue Torch Financing and Warrant Agreement 
 On August 9, 2022, we entered into a financing agreement and warrant agreement with Blue Torch, pursuant to which, among other things, Blue Torch agreed to extend an approximately 32.2 million senior secured term loan (the Financing Agreement ). The Financing Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets of us and our subsidiaries. 
 For additional information regarding the Financing Agreement, refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies since the 2023 10-K. For a description of critical accounting policies that affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of the 2023 10-K. 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 See discussion under Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on new accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective at a reasonable assurance level.

 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As previously disclosed in our 2023 10-K, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we identified the following material weaknesses, which still exist as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to insufficient resources needed to fully implement our internal control risk assessment process, evaluate the technical accounting aspects of certain material transactions and effectively design and implement certain process level controls. We also identified a material weakness regarding the risk assessment process related to information technology general controls and activities of service organizations, the design and implementation of logical access, segregation of duties and program change controls and certain process level controls related to information used in the execution of those controls that impact our financial reporting processes. 
 These material weaknesses resulted in the immaterial misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for quarterly periods in 2023. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of the account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Remediation Plan 
 We have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, measures designed to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses. 
 We have hired finance and accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge and experience to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting. 
 We have designed and implemented controls over our internal control risk assessment process to identify and assess risk and implement or enhance controls to mitigate those risks. 
 We have redesigned and implemented our information technology IT general controls, including logical access controls and program change controls, and hired additional IT personnel. 
 We have redesigned and implemented our controls related to the assessment of service organizations and segregation of duties. 
 We designed and implemented control enhancements to evaluate the technical accounting aspects of material transactions. 
 We designed and implemented control enhancements across certain business process-level controls, including the information used in the operation of the control. 
 We engaged third-party consultants to assist management in evaluating the design and performing operating effectiveness testing of certain internal controls over financial reporting. 
 We will consider the material weaknesses to be remediated once the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. In addition, as we continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may implement additional internal control changes as we deem necessary. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified during the evaluation that occurred during our quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We are supplementing the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our 2023 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 Q2 2024 10-Q to include the following risk factor, which should be read in conjunction with the other risk factors presented in our 2023 10-K and Q2 2024 10-Q. 
 We have failed to comply with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 
 On September 24, 2024, we received a written notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq that for 30 consecutive business days from August 9, 2024 to September 23, 2024, the closing bid price of our common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Market was below 1.00 and no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Listing Rules 5450(a)(1), which requires a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The staff also notified us that for 30 consecutive business days from August 8, 2024 to September 23, 2024 our Market Value of Listed Securities MVLS was below the 50,000,000 minimum required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). The notice had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock. 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5810(c)(3)(A) and 5810(c)(3)(C), we have a period of 180 calendar days or until March 24, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the MVLS Requirement or we will receive written notification that our securities are subject to delisting. We are considering options to resolve the non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and MVLS Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that we will regain or maintain compliance with the applicable continued listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Delisting from Nasdaq could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. In addition, without a Nasdaq market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our common stock, the sale or purchase of our common stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock could decline. 
 In the event we are delisted from Nasdaq, the only established trading market for our common stock would be eliminated, and we would be forced to list our shares on the OTC Markets or another quotation medium, depending on our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. As a result, an investor would likely find it more difficult to trade or obtain accurate price quotations for our shares. Delisting would likely also reduce the visibility, liquidity, and value of our common stock, reduce institutional investor interest in our company, and may increase the volatility of our common stock. Delisting could also cause a loss of confidence of potential industry partners, lenders, and employees, which could further harm our business and our future prospects.
