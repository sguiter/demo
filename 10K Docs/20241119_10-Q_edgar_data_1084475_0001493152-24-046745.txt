The Special preferred share controls 60 of the company s total voting rights. The issuance of the preferred share to
Community Economic Development Capital LLC gave to Community Economic Development Capital LLC, the controlling vote to control and dominate
the affairs of the company theretofor. 

On
September 15, 2020, Video River Networks, Inc. (the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Kid Castle Educational
Corporation Kid Castle , KDCE ), an entity related to, and controlled by our President and CEO with respect
to the purchase through private placement, of shares of its preferred stock at a purchase price of in cash and a transfer
of interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (a California Limited Liability Company). The shares
were issued to the investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 based upon exemptions from registration provided under
Section 4(2) of the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The issuances did not involve any public offering; no general solicitation
or general advertising was used in connection with the offering. As at the time of this transaction, all four businesses involved in
the transaction were controlled by Mr. Frank I Igwealor. Because both the buyer and seller in the above acquisitions were under the control
of the same person, the transaction was classified as common control transaction and therefore fall under Transactions
Between Entities Under Common Control subsections of ASC 805-50. Following the acquisition, the Company now has (which has
now grown to of the voting control of and of operating and financial control of Kid Castle. 

On
April 21, 2021, the Company sold Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. CBDX ), a California corporation, to Premier Information
Management, Inc. for in cash. As further consideration pursuant to the stated sales, CBDX returned Kid Castle Educational Inc., the
parent Company of GMPW, the shares of KDCE preferred stock and shares of KDCE common stock that CBDX bought in October
of 2019. Pursuant to the April 21, 2021 transaction, CBDX ceased from being a subsidiary of GMPW, effective April 1, 2021. 

On
December 30, 2021, 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include Video River Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries of its subsidiary, KDCE
and subsidiaries, in which it has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. 

Following
the completion of the transaction with Kid Castle, the Company having been partly freed of the internally-managed real estate holding
business that focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of specialized industrial properties, affordable housing and opportunity
zone real estate properties and businesses, has decided to return back to its original technology-focused businesses of Power Controls,
Battery Technology, Wireless Technology, and Residential utility meters and remote, mission-critical devices. In addition to above list,
the Company is spreading its wings into the Electric Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics EV-AI-ML-R businesses/markets, targeting acquisition, ownership and operation of acquired EV-AI-ML-R businesses or portfolio of EV-AI-ML-R businesses. 

On
January 12, 2024, due to KDCE s need to simplify its balance sheet in order to approach the regulators to remove the Caveat Emptor
tag from KDCE s OTC Market profile, it sold Alpharidge Capital LLC, its main operating subsidiary to American Community Capital,
LP., a California limited partnership controlled by our President and CEO Mr. Frank I Igwealor, in exchange for cash payment of 
payable in two hundred and forty equal monthly payments of , beginning on July 1, 2024. As at the time of confirmation of
the transaction, the combined average market capitalization of NIHK and KDCE was for NIHK, and for KDCE),
showing the FAIR MARKET value of the two parents of Alpharidge to have a combined market value of . 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include KDCE and subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

ASC
810 requires that the investor with the controlling financial interest should consolidate the investee/affiliate. ASC 810-10 requires
that an equity interest investor consolidates a VIE when it retains an investment in the entity, is considered a variable interest investor
in the entity, and is the primary beneficiary of the entity. An investor in a VIE is a variable interest beneficiary when,
per an arrangement s governing documents, the investor will absorb a portion of the VIE s expected losses or will receive
a portion of the entity s residual returns. The variable interest beneficiary retaining a controlling financial interest
in the VIE is designated as its primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. A variable interest beneficiary retains
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when that beneficiary retains the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
have the greatest influence over the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant
losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the ASC 810 test above,
Video River Networks Inc. is the primary beneficiary of Video River Networks, Inc. (the VIE because Video River Networks
retained a controlling financial interest in the VIE and has the power to direct the activities of the VIE, having the greatest influence
over the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant losses and the right to determine
and receive benefits from the VIE. 

from disposition of an operating unit,
and an accumulated deficit of . These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise debt or equity funding to meet our ongoing operating expenses and ultimately
in merging with another entity with experienced management and profitable operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful
in achieving these objectives.

controlling stake in Kid Castle Educational Corporation. Because of the
consolidated subsidiary relationship between these two companies, the singular Revenue, Assets and Liabilities recognized and disclosed
on the financial statements of Kid Castle Educational Corporation are also recognized and disclosed on the financial statements of Video
River Networks, Inc. pursuant to ASC 810. 

The
Company generates revenue primarily from: (1) the sale of homes/properties, (2) commissions and fees charged on each real estate services
transaction closed by our lead agents or partner agents, and (3) sales of trading securities using its broker firm, less original purchase
cost. Net trading revenues primarily consist of revenues from trading securities earned upon completion of trade, net of any trading
fees. A trading is completed when earned and recognized at a point in time, on a trade-date basis, as the Company executes trades. The
Company records trading revenue on a net basis, trading sales less original purchase cost. Net realized gains and losses from securities
transactions are determined for federal income tax and financial reporting purposes on the first-in, first-out method and represent proceeds
on disposition of investments less the cost basis of investments. Sale of real estate properties are recognized at the sales price/amount
and the total cost (including cost of rehabilitations) associated with the property acquisition and rehabilitation are classified in
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

business segment produced revenue during the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Revenue
Recognition Principal (securities) transactions 

The
Company records securities transactions and related revenue and expenses on a trade-date basis. Other income is recognized when earned. 

Interest
Income and Expense 

The
Company earns interest income and incurs interest expense primarily in connection with its electronic brokerage customer business and
its securities lending activities, which are recorded on an accrual basis and are included in interest income and interest expense, respectively,
in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did recorded revenue from net interest income. 

Principal
Transactions 

Principal
transactions include gains and losses as a result of changes in the fair value of financial instruments owned, at fair value, financial
instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value, and other investments measured at fair value (i.e., unrealized gains and losses)
and realized gains and losses related to the Company s principal transactions. Included are net gains and losses on stocks, options,
U.S. and foreign government securities, municipal securities, futures, foreign exchange, precious metals and other derivative instruments,
which are reported on a net basis in other income in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Dividends are integral
to the valuation of stocks. Accordingly, dividend income and expense attributable to financial instruments owned, at fair value and financial
instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value, are reported on a net basis in other income in the condensed consolidated statements
of comprehensive income. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not record any revenue from principal transaction. 

Contract
balances 

Substantially
all receivables from contracts with customers within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue From Contracts
With Customers (ASC 606), are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Unsatisfied
performance obligations 

We
do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606.
The practical expedient applies to and is elected for contracts where we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to
invoice for services performed. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
(other than those that are subject to an elective practical expedient under ASC 606). 

Revenue
Recognition Entrepreneurship Development 

Under
ASC 606, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. FASB ASC 606-10-05-3 through 05-4 and 606-10-10-2
through 10-4. To achieve the core principle of ASC 606, an entity should take the following actions: Step 1: Identify the contract with
a customer; Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract; Step 3: Determine the transaction price; Step 4: Allocate the
transaction price; and Step 5: Recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

Revenue
is recognized when a company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when
the customer obtains control of that good or service). An entity should consider the terms of the contract and all relevant facts and
circumstances when applying the revenue recognition standard. An entity should apply the revenue recognition standard, including the
use of any practical expedients, consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our Entrepreneurship Development Revenue was derived from the sale of asset (control in pubco) to the buyer who
assumes control of the pubco at the close of the sales transaction. A sale transaction could involve cash-only, cash and note, or note-only.
For the contract that includes financing or convertible note, the seller evaluated the collectibility of the transaction price, and the
probability that the seller will collect the consideration. Seller addressed the risk of collectability by using a convertible note with
very favorable conversion. 

Determining
whether a sale is to a customer: Per ASC 610-20-15-4(a), if the counterparty in the transaction is a customer and the assets being
transferred are an output of the reporting entity s ordinary activities, the transaction is within the scope of ASC 606. As stated
in ASC 606, a customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the reporting
entity s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration (e.g., a car manufacturer sells a car that it produced to a customer,
a homebuilder sells a home that it developed to a customer). 

Step
1: A sales contract/agreement (SPA) is used to consummate the sale. Buyer and seller signed the SPA and other collateral documents
including the Notes and other documents designed to ensure collectability if the sale is cash-and-note or note-only. Where the sale was
not an all-cash transaction, seller evaluated the collectibility of the transaction price, or the probability that the seller will collect
the consideration. 

Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. All performance obligations under the SPA must be completed prior to the
close of the transaction. Our Entrepreneurship Development revenue was only recognized after all performance obligations has been performed
or completed. 

Step
3: Determine the transaction price. The transaction price for each sale recognized as EDI revenue was listed on the face of the contract. 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price . The transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each specific
good or service promised to the customer. Since EDI revenue did not involve bundled services, rather EDI assets are accounted for as
a standalone transaction, the total sale price is recognized immediately. 

Step
5: Recognize revenue. Revenue is recognized as the seller satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised
good or service to the customer. As of September 30, 2024, we did not record any EDI sales completed in the period. 

. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is
not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts. It is possible that at times, the company s cash and cash equivalents
with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. In such situation, the Company s
management would assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes
that any associated credit risk exposures would be addressed and mitigated.

The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract
with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements
that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either using a retrospective or prospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) 
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . Currently, there is no guidance
in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to
continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide such guidance. In doing
so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management
to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently
in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation
every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans,
(5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a
period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update
are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We currently
do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities. This ASU clarifies that the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements,
and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in
FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on net income. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In
February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations
Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. 
This ASU addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several arrangements
including debt arrangements, other contractual obligations, and settled litigation and judicial rulings. The ASU is effective for public
entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent s Accounting for the Cumulative
Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in
a Foreign Entity . This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a
part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets
that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The guidance outlines the events when cumulative translation adjustments
should be released into net income and is intended by FASB to eliminate some disparity in current accounting practice. This ASU is effective
prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We currently do not anticipate
this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting. 
The amendments require an entity to prepare its financial statements using the liquidation basis of accounting when liquidation is imminent.
Liquidation is imminent when the likelihood is remote that the entity will return from liquidation and either (a) a plan for liquidation
is approved by the person or persons with the authority to make such a plan effective and the likelihood is remote that the execution
of the plan will be blocked by other parties or (b) a plan for liquidation is being imposed by other forces (for example, involuntary
bankruptcy). If a plan for liquidation was specified in the entity s governing documents from the entity s inception (for
example, limited-life entities), the entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting only if the approved plan for liquidation
differs from the plan for liquidation that was specified at the entity s inception. The amendments require financial statements
prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting to present relevant information about an entity s expected resources in liquidation
by measuring and presenting assets at the amount of the expected cash proceeds from liquidation. The entity should include in its presentation
of assets any items it had not previously recognized under U.S. GAAP but that it expects to either sell in liquidation or use in settling
liabilities (for example, trademarks). The amendments are effective for entities that determine liquidation is imminent during annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods therein. We currently do not anticipate this standard
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

We
have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements. Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting
pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.

transaction gave the Company of the voting control of GiveMePower. As at the time of this transaction, all four businesses involved

Basis
of Presentation 

The
unaudited financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include a summary of our significant accounting
policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary
to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

ASC
810 requires that the investor with the controlling financial interest should consolidate the investee/affiliate. ASC 810-10 requires
that an equity interest investor consolidates a VIE when it retains an investment in the entity, is considered a variable interest investor
in the entity, and is the primary beneficiary of the entity. An investor in a VIE is a variable interest beneficiary when,
per an arrangement s governing documents, the investor will absorb a portion of the VIE s expected losses or will receive
a portion of the entity s residual returns. The variable interest beneficiary retaining a controlling financial interest
in the VIE is designated as its primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. A variable interest beneficiary retains
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when that beneficiary retains the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
have the greatest influence over the VIE s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE s significant
losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the ASC 810 test above,
Video River Network, Inc. is the primary beneficiary of Kid Castle Educational Corporation VIE-2 ), Kid Castle Educational
Corporation is the primary beneficiary of GiveMePower Corporation (the VIE-1 because Video River retained a controlling
financial interest in the VIE-2 and has the power to direct the activities of the VIE-2, having the greatest influence over the VIE-2 s
economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE-2 s significant losses and the right to determine and receive
benefits from the VIE-2. Similarly, Kid Castle Educational Corporation is the primary beneficiary of GiveMePower Corporation (the VIE-1 ).
Kid Castle retained a controlling financial interest in the VIE-1 and has the power to direct the activities of the VIE-1, having the
greatest influence over the VIE-1 s economic performance and retains an obligation to absorb the VIE-1 s significant losses
and the right to determine and receive benefits from the VIE-1. 

28 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include the 3 months operating results of the all wholly owned subsidiaries
and the balance sheet represent the financial position as at September 30, 2024, of the Company includes Alpharidge Capital LLC and Others
subsidiaries in which Video River Networks has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), after elimination of intercompany transactions
and accounts. 

Overview 

General
 Electric Vehicles (EV) Business 

The
Company s Electric Vehicles (EV) business model is a newly created business model created in the 3rd quarter of 2020, for the purpose
of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business acquisition with
one or more EV manufacturers and related businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our EV Business acquisition plan.
We have not selected any specific EV Business acquisition target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive
discussions, directly or indirectly, with any EV Business acquisition target. We have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect
that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial EV Business acquisition. While we may pursue
an acquisition opportunity in the Electric Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics EV-AI-ML-R industry or sector, we intend to focus on: (1) businesses that source, design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance,
affordable and fully electric vehicles; and (2) businesses that design, manufacture, install and sell Power Controls, Battery Technology,
Wireless Technology, and Residential utility meters and remote, mission-critical devices mostly engineered using Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning and Robotic technologies. 

Our
management team is comprised of two business professionals that have a broad range of experience in executive leadership, strategy development
and implementation, operations management, financial policy and corporate transactions. Our management team members have worked together
in the past, at Goldstein Franklin, Inc. and other firms as executive leaders and senior managers spearheading turnarounds, rollups and
industry-focused consolidation while generating shareholder value for many for investors and stakeholders. 

We
believe that our management team is well positioned to identify acquisition opportunities in the marketplace. Our management team s
industry expertise, principal investing transaction experience and business acumen will make us an attractive partner and enhance our
ability to complete a successful Business acquisition. Our management believes that its ability to identify and implement value creation
initiatives has been an essential driver of past performance and will remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy. 

Although
our management team is well positioned and have experience to identify acquisition opportunities in the marketplace, past performance
of our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any EV Business acquisition we may consummate or (ii)
that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial EV Business acquisition. You should not rely on the historical
performance record of our management team as indicative of our future performance. Additionally, in the course of their respective careers,
members of our management team have been involved in businesses and deals that were unsuccessful. Our officers and directors have not
had management experience with EV companies in the past.

General
 Real Estate Business 

Our
real estate operations has two lines of business: (1) promote and preserve affordable housing and economic development across urban neighborhoods
in the United States; and (2) acquire, hold and manage specialized assets. To achieve our objectives, we plan to acquire, own, renovate,
develop, redevelop, operate, dispose of, and manage specialized assets including industrial and commercial real estate, affordable housing
and rental property and multi-family properties both on our own and through our investment management platform. We focus primarily on
commercial and multifamily properties located in urban and high-density suburban markets throughout the United States. Our real estate
platform is internally managed with primarily focused on: (1) the acquisition, ownership and management of specialized industrial properties;
and (2) ownership, operation and development of multi-family affordable housing properties. 

Our
Business Plan 

Returning
back to its foremost business model of technology focused operations, Video River Networks, Inc. (the Company ), a technology
firm intends to operate and manage a portfolio of Electric Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics EV-AI-ML-R assets, businesses and operations in North America. The Company s current targeted portfolio businesses include those that source,
design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance, affordable and fully electric vehicles; and design, manufacture, install
and sell Power Controls, Battery Technology, Wireless Technology, and Residential utility meters and remote, mission-critical devices
mostly engineered using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotic technologies. 

Our
current technology-focused business model was a result of our board resolution on September 15, 2020 to spin-in our specialty real estate
holding business to an operating subsidiary and then pivot back to being a technology company. The Company has now returned to its original
technology-focused businesses of Power Controls, Battery Technology, Wireless Technology, and Residential utility meters and remote,
mission-critical devices. In addition to above list, the Company intends to spread its wings into the Electric Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning and Robotics EV-AI-ML-R businesses/markets, targeting acquisition, ownership, and operation of acquired
EV-AI-ML-R businesses or portfolio of EV-AI-ML-R businesses. 

Video
River Networks, Inc., prior to September 15, 2020, used to be a specialty real estate holding company, focusing on the acquisition, ownership,
and management of specialized industrial properties. The Company s real estate business objective is to maximize stockholder returns
through a combination of (1) distributions to our stockholders, (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents,
which we hope to pass on to stockholders in the form of increased distributions, and (3) potential long-term appreciation in the value
of our properties from capital gains upon future sale. As a real estate holding company, the Company is engaged primarily in the ownership,
operation, management, acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly multifamily housing and specialized industrial properties
in the United States. 

Having
partially freed itself from the day-to-day operation of the real estate operations, the Company now returns to its technology root with
a primary purpose of acquiring Electric Vehicles manufacturer or doing a joint venture (JV) with Electric Vehicles businesses that source,
design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance, affordable and fully electric vehicles; and design, manufacture, install
and sell Power Controls, Battery Technology, Wireless Technology, and Residential utility meters and remote, mission-critical devices
mostly engineered using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotic technologies. 

Business
Strategy and Deal Origination 

We
have not finalized an acquisition target yet, but are making progress in identifying several potential candidates from which we intend
to pick those that meet our criteria for acquisition. Our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire and, after
our initial EV Business acquisition, build an EV company that source, design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance, affordable
and fully electric vehicles that suit the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational expertise. Our Business
acquisition strategy will leverage our management team s network of potential transaction sources, where we believe a combination
of our relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to improve
their overall value proposition. 

30 

Our
management team s objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our shareholders by applying our disciplined
strategy of underwriting intrinsic worth and implementing changes after making an acquisition to unlock value. While our approach is
focused on the EV-AI-ML-R industries where we have differentiated insights, we also have successfully driven change through a comprehensive
value creation plan framework. We favor opportunities where we can accelerate the target s growth initiatives. As a management
team we have successfully applied this approach over approximately 16 years and have deployed capital successfully in a range of market
cycles. 

We
plan to utilize the network and Finance industry experience of our Chief Executive Officer and our management team in seeking an initial
EV Business acquisition and employing our Business acquisition strategy described below. Our CEO is a top financial professional with
designations that include, CPA, CMA, and CFM. He s very knowledgeable in the fields of corporate law, real estate, lending, turnarounds
and restructuring. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and
corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of EV acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed
through our management team s extensive experience: 

investing
 in and operating a wide range of businesses; 

growing
 brands through repositioning, increasing household penetration and geographic expansion; expanding into new distribution channels,
 such as e-Commerce, in an increasingly omni-channel world; 

identifying
 lessons learned and applying solutions across product portfolios and channels; 

sourcing,
 structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; 

developing
 relationships with sellers, financing providers, advisors, and target management teams; and 

executing
 transformational transactions in a wide range of businesses under varying economic and financial market conditions. 

In
addition, drawing on their extensive investing and operating experience, our management team anticipates tapping four major sources of
deal flow: 

directly
 identifying potentially attractive undervalued situations through primary research into EV industries and companies; 

receiving
 information from our management team s global contacts about a potentially attractive situation; 

leads
 from investment bankers and advisors regarding businesses seeking a combination or added value that matches our strengths; and 

inbound
 opportunities from a company or existing stakeholders seeking a combination, including corporate divestitures. 

31 

We
expect this network will provide our management team with a robust flow of EV acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that
target EV Business candidates will be brought to our attention by various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants,
private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Upon completion of this
offering, members of our management team will communicate with their network of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search
for a target company and a potential Business acquisition and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential leads. 

Acquisition/Business
acquisition Criteria 

Consistent
with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective
target EV businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities. While we intend to acquire EV
companies that we believe exhibit one or more of the following characteristics, we may decide to enter into our initial EV Business acquisition
with a target EV business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire EV companies that source, design, develop,
manufacture and distribute high-performance, affordable and fully electric vehicles: 

have
 potential for significant growth, or can act as an attractive EV acquisition platform, following our initial EV Business acquisition; 

have
 demonstrated market segment, category and/or cost leadership and would benefit from our extensive network and insights; 

provide
 operational platform and/or infrastructure for variety of EV models and/or services, with the potential for revenue, market share,
 footprint and/or distribution improvements; 

are
 at the forefront of EV evolution around changing consumer trends; 

offer
 marketing, pricing and product mix optimization opportunities across distribution channels; 

are
 fundamentally sound companies that could be underperforming their potential and/or offer compelling value; 

offer
 the opportunity for our management team to partner with established target management teams or business owners to achieve long-term
 strategic and operational excellence, or, in some cases, where our access to accomplished executives and the skills of the management
 of identified targets warrants replacing or supplementing existing management; 

exhibit
 unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital and a need for capital to achieve the company s growth
 strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and 

will
 offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. 

These
criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial EV Business acquisition may
be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management
may deem relevant. If we decide to enter into our initial EV Business acquisition with a target EV Business that does not meet the above
criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target EV Business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications
related to our initial EV Business acquisition. 

32 

Acquisition/Business
acquisition Process 

In
evaluating a prospective target EV business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things,
meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of EV manufacturing facilities, as well as a review of
financial and other information. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. 

In
order to execute our business strategy, we intend to: 

Assemble
a team of EV industry and financial experts: For each potential transaction, we intend to assemble a team of EV industry and financial
experts to supplement our management s efforts to identify and resolve key issues facing a target EV Business. We intend to construct
an operating and financial plan that optimizes the potential to increase shareholder value. With extensive experience investing in both
healthy and underperforming businesses, we expect that our management will be able to demonstrate to the target EV business and its stakeholders
that we have the resources and expertise to lead the combined company through complex and potentially turbulent market conditions and
provide the strategic and operational direction necessary to grow the business in order to maximize cash flows and improve the overall
strategic prospects for the company. 

Conduct
rigorous research and analysis: Performing disciplined, fundamental research and analysis is core to our strategy, and we intend
to conduct extensive due diligence to evaluate the impact that a transaction may have on a target EV Business. 

Business
acquisition driven by trend analysis: We intend to understand the underlying purchase and industry behaviors that would enhance a
potential transaction s attractiveness. We have extensive experience in identifying and analyzing evolving industry and consumer
trends, and we expect to perform macro as well as bottoms-up analysis on consumer and industry trends. 

Acquire
the target company at an attractive price relative to our view of intrinsic value: Combining rigorous analysis as well as input from
industry and financial experts, our management team intends to develop its view of the intrinsic value of a potential Business acquisition.
In doing so, our management team will evaluate future cash flow potential, relative industry valuation metrics and precedent transactions
to inform its view of intrinsic value, with the intention of creating a business acquisition at an attractive price relative to its view
of intrinsic value. 

Implement
operational and financial structuring opportunities: Our management team has the ability to structure and execute a business acquisition
that will establish a capital structure that will support the growth in shareholder value and give it the flexibility to grow organically
and/or through strategic acquisitions. We intend to also develop and implement strategies and initiatives to improve the business 
operational and financial performance and create a platform for growth. 

Seek
strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further grow shareholder value: Our management team intends to analyze the strategic direction
of the company, including evaluating potential non-core asset sales to create financial and/or operational flexibility for the company
to engage in organic and/or inorganic growth. Our management team intends to evaluate strategic opportunities and chart a clear path
to take the EV business to the next level after the Business acquisition. 

33 

After
the initial EV Business acquisition, our management team intends to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing shareholder value, including
evaluating the experience and expertise of incumbent management and making changes where appropriate, examining opportunities for revenue
enhancement, cost savings, operating efficiencies and strategic acquisitions and divestitures and developing and implementing corporate
strategies and initiatives to improve profitability and long-term value. In doing so, our management team anticipates evaluating corporate
governance, opportunistically accessing capital markets and other opportunities to enhance liquidity, identifying acquisition and divestiture
opportunities, and properly aligning management and board incentives with growing shareholder value. Our management team intends to pursue
post-merger initiatives through participation on the board of directors, through direct involvement with company operations and/or calling
upon a stable of former managers and advisors when necessary. 

Strategic
Approach to Management. We intend to approach the management of a company as strategy consultants would. This means that we approach
business with performance-based metrics based on strategic and operational goals, both at the overall company level and for specific
divisions and functions. 

Corporate
Governance and Oversight. Active participation as board members can include many activities ranging from conducting monthly or quarterly
board meetings to chairing standing (compensation, audit or investment committees) or special committees, replacing or supplementing
company management teams when necessary, adding outside directors with industry expertise which may or may not include members of our
own board of directors, providing guidance on strategic and operational issues including revenue enhancement opportunities, cost savings,
brand repositioning, operating efficiencies, reviewing and testing annual budgets, reviewing acquisitions and divestitures and assisting
in the accessing of capital markets to further optimize financing costs and fund expansion. 

Direct
Operational Involvement. Our management team members, through ongoing board service, intend to actively engage with company management.
These activities may include: (i) establishing an agenda for management and instilling a sense of accountability and urgency; (ii) aligning
the interest of management with growing shareholder value; (iii) providing strategic planning and management consulting assistance, particularly
in regards to re-invested capital and growth capital in order to grow revenues, achieve more optimal operating scale or eliminate costs;
(iv) establishing measurable key performance metrics; and (v) complementing product lines and brands while growing market share in attractive
market categories. These skill sets will be integral to shareholder value creation. 

M A
Expertise and Add-On Acquisitions. Our management team has expertise in identifying, acquiring, and integrating synergistic, margin-enhancing
and transformational businesses. We intend to, wherever possible, utilize M A as a strategic tool to strengthen the financial profile
of an EV business we acquire, as well as its competitive positioning. We would seek to enter accretive Business acquisitions where our
management team or an acquired company s management team can seamlessly transition to working together as one organization and
team. 

Access
to Portfolio Company Managers and Advisors. Through their combined 32+ year history of investing in and controlling businesses, our
management team members have developed strong professional relationships with former company managers and advisors. When appropriate,
we intend to bring in outside directors, managers, or consultants to assist in corporate governance and operational turnaround activities.
The use of supplemental advisors should provide additional resources to management to address time intensive issues that may delay an
organization from realizing its full potential shareholder returns. 

Our
acquisition criteria, due diligence processes and value creation methods are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to
the merits of a particular initial EV Business acquisition may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well
as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial
EV Business acquisition with a target EV Business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target
EV Business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial EV Business acquisition, which,
as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with
the SEC. 

34 

Sourcing
of Potential Business acquisition Targets 

We
believe that the operational and transactional experience of our management team and their respective affiliates, and the relationships
they have developed as a result of such experience, will provide us with a substantial number of potential Business acquisition targets.
These individuals and entities have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network
has grown through sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses and maintaining relationships with sellers, financing sources and target
management teams. Our management team members have significant experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial
market conditions. We believe that these networks of contacts and relationships and this experience will provide us with important sources
of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target EV Business candidates may be brought to our attention from various
unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest
noncore assets or divisions. 

Other
Acquisition Considerations 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial EV Business acquisition with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors.
In the event we seek to complete our initial EV Business acquisition with a company that is affiliated with our officers or directors,
we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent
firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that
our initial EV Business acquisition is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Unless
we complete our initial EV Business acquisition with an affiliated entity, or our Board of Directors cannot independently determine the
fair market value of the target EV Business or businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm, another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or from an
independent accounting firm that the price we are paying for a target is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion
is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which will have significant discretion
in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary
greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials,
as applicable, related to our initial EV Business acquisition. 

Members
of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering,
and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target EV Business is an appropriate business with
which to effectuate our initial EV Business acquisition. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest
with respect to evaluating a particular Business acquisition if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included
by a target EV Business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial EV Business acquisition. 

In
the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant
to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to
his or her fiduciary duties, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an
entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or
contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the
opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially
undermine our ability to complete our Business acquisition. 

35 

Plan
of Operations for the Next Twelve Months 

While
our major focus is to find, acquire and manage an EV business, our real estate portfolio is still alive and must figure in our plan of
operation. In the next twelve months, we plan on buying rehabilitating and selling up to six properties and adding the net proceeds obtained
from the sales to finance our acquisition business plan. 

The
Company will continue to evaluate its projected expenditures relative to its available cash and to seek additional means of financing
in order to satisfy the Company s working capital and other cash requirements. 

Upon
completion of the acquisition of an Electric Vehicles manufacturer or doing a joint venture (JV) with Electric Vehicles businesses that
source, design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance, affordable and fully electric vehicles, our strategy will subsequently
include distribution of the electric vehicles and related product lines to retailers and consumers across North America. 

We
intend to implement the following tasks within the next twelve months: 

1.
 Month 1-3: Phase 1 (1-3 months in duration; 600,000 to 1 million in estimated fund receipt) 

a. 
 Hire
 2 business development manager and officer manager to implement our business plan. 

b. 
 Acquire
 and consolidate stakes in the operations of at least two select Ai, Machine Learning, Robotics, and digital assets and biopharma
 businesses. 

2.
 Month 3-6 Phase 2 (1-3 months in duration; cost control, process improvements, admin management.). 

a. 
 Integrate
 acquired business into the Company s model consolidate the operations of the businesses including integration of their
 accounting and finance systems, synchronization of their operating systems, and harmonization of their human resources functions. 

b. 
 Complete
 and file quarterly reports and other required filings for the quarter 

3.
 Month 6-9: Phase 3 (1-3 months in duration; 600,000 to 900,000 in estimated fund receipt) 

a. 
 Identify
 and acquire complementary/similar businesses or assets in the target market 

36 

4.
 Month 9-12: Phase 4 (1-3 months duration; use acquired businesses free cash flow for more acquisitions) 

a. 
 Run
 the businesses efficiently, giving employees a conducive and friendly workplace and add value to investors and shareholders by identifying
 and reducing excesses and also identifying and executing growth strategies 

b. 
 Acquire
 more businesses that are below their book-value or undervalued businesses, restructure the businesses, and sell the businesses for
 profit or hold them for cash flow. 

5.
 Operating expenses during the twelve months would be as follows: 

a. 
 For
 the six months through May 31, 2025, we anticipate to incur general and other operating expenses of 388,000. 

b. 
 For
 the six months through November 30, 2025 we anticipate to incur additional general and other operating expenses of 378,000. 

The
execution of our current plan of operations requires us to raise significant additional capital immediately. If we are successful in
raising capital through the sale of shares or borrowing, we believe that the Company will have sufficient cash resources to fund its
plan of operations for the next twelve months. 

If
we are unable to do so, our ability to continue as a going concern will be in jeopardy, likely causing us to curtail and possibly cease
operations. 

We
continually evaluate our plan of operations discussed above to determine the manner in which we can most effectively utilize our limited
cash resources. The timing of completion of any aspect of our plan of operations is highly dependent upon the availability of cash to
implement that aspect of the plan and other factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will successfully obtain the required
capital or revenues, or, if obtained, that the amounts will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. The inability to secure additional
capital would have a material adverse effect on us, including the possibility that we would have to sell or forego a portion or all of
our assets or cease operations. If we discontinue our operations, we will not have sufficient funds to pay any amounts to our stockholders. 

Even
if we raise additional capital in the near future, if our current business plan is not successfully executed, our ability to fund our
business research and development, or our financial product deployment and services efforts would likely be seriously impaired. The ability
of a business research and development business and continuing operations is conditioned upon moving the development of products and
services toward commercialization. If in the future we are not able to demonstrate adequate progress in the development and commercialization
of our product, we will not be able to raise the capital we need to continue our business operations and business activities, and we
will likely not have sufficient liquidity or cash resources to continue operating. 

37 

Because
our working capital requirements depend upon numerous factors there can be no assurance that our current cash resources will be sufficient
to fund our operations. At present, we have no committed external sources of capital, and do not expect any significant product revenues
for the foreseeable future. Thus, we will require immediate additional financing to fund future operations. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be able to obtain funds on acceptable terms, if at all. 

MERGERS
AND ACQUISITION 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, in which the Company has a controlling voting
interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities VIE provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

We
used the acquisition method of accounting (also known as business combination accounting) for acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group
method to account for the purchase of businesses. The cost of the acquisition was measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 

Competition 

Our
business is highly competitive. We are in direct competition with more established companies, private equity firms, private investors,
and management companies. Many management companies offer similar products and services for business rollups and consolidations. We may
be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out acquisition, operations, and restructuring
efforts. These competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger capital-base, marketing, research
and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development
costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging opportunities and changes in customer requirements or devote
greater resources to the development, acquisition, and promotion. 

Increased
competition could result in us failing to attract significant capital or maintaining them. If we are unable to compete successfully against
current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed. 

We
hope to maintain our competitive advantage by keeping abreast of market dynamism that is face by our industry, and by utilizing the experience,
knowledge, and expertise of our management team. Moreover, we believe that we distinguish ourselves in the ways our model envisaged transformation
of businesses. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by governmental agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate
businesses. However, we may be subject to the rules governing acquisition and disposition of businesses, real estates and personal properties
in each of the state where we have our operations. We may also be subject to various state laws designed to protect buyers and sellers
of businesses. We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our business model. Once we commence our biopharmaceutical
acquisitions/operations, we would be subject to many regulations that apply to pharmaceutical and medical industry participants. 

38 

Intellectual
Property 

We
currently have no patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property. We do not consider the grant of patents, trademarks
or other registered intellectual property essential to the success of our business. 

Employees 

We
do not have a W-2 employee at the present. Frank Ikechukwu Igwealor, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
is our only full-time staff as of September 30, 2024, pending when we could formalize an employment contract for him. In addition to
Mr. Igwealor, we have three part-time unpaid staff who helps with bookkeeping and administrative chores. Most of our part-time staff,
officers, and directors will devote their time as needed to our business and are expect to devote at least 15 hours per week to our business
operations. We plan on formalizing employment contract for those staff currently helping us without pay. Furthermore, in the immediate
future, we intend to use independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an as needed basis pending
financial resources being available. We may use independent contractors and consultants once we receive sufficient funding to hire additional
employees. Even then, we will principally rely on independent contractors for substantially all our technical and marketing needs. 

The
Company has no written employment contract or agreement with any person. Currently, we are not actively seeking additional employees
or engaging any consultants through a formal written agreement or contract. Services are provided on an as-needed basis to date. This
may change if we are able to secure financing through equity or loans to the Company. As our company grows, we expect to hire more full-time
employees.

39 

Net
Income Net income for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,486,138 as compared to Net Income of 658,146 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Net Income was singularly related to the disposition of an operating subsidiary in exchange
for cash payment of 1,560,992 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6,510, beginning on July 1, 2024. 

OCI
- Unrealized Gain or Other Comprehensive Income for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,560,992 , as compared to Unrealized
gain of 0, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a result of the disposition of an operating subsidiary in exchange
for cash payment of 1,560,992 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6,510. 

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital of 77,020, consisting of twelve months of due from its Trade Receivable of
monthly 6,510, and 1,100 in short-term liabilities. 

For
the three months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 69,419 on operating activities, generated cash of 0 from investing
activities, and generated cash of 74,024 from financing activities, resulting in an decrease in total cash of 4,605 and a cash balance
of 4,610 for the period. For the three months period ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated 817,900 from operating activities,
generated cash of 496,328 on investing activities, and used cash of 1,359,351 on financing activities, resulting in an decrease in
total cash of 45,123 and a cash balance of 19,456 for the period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, total stockholders equity decreased to 1,484,143 from 3,490,614 as of December 31, 2023, accounting for
the period s net loss of 75,929 and the 1,961,129 operating unit disposition write-off related to the disposition of an operating
subsidiary in exchange for 1,562,067 payable in two hundred and forty (240) equal monthly payments of 6,510. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 4,610 (i.e., cash could be used to fund operations). The Company does believe
our current cash balances will be sufficient to allow us to fund our operating plan for the next twelve months. However, our ability
to continue as a going concern is still dependent on us obtaining adequate capital to fund operation or maintaining consecutive quarterly
profitability. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, or maintain consecutive quarterly profitability, we could be forced to cease
operations or substantially curtail its drug development activities. These conditions could raise substantial doubt as to our ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our
principal sources of liquidity are: (1) Crypto Currency Mining, (2) Real Estate Sales, (3) Trading Securities, and (4) Entrepreneurship
Development Initiative. In the past, we have been generating cash from loans to us by our major shareholder. In order to be able to achieve
our strategic goals, we need to further expand our business and implement our business plan. To continue to develop our business plan
and generate sales, significant capital has been and will continue to be required. Management intends to fund future operations through
private or public equity and/or debt offerings. We continue to engage in preliminary discussions with potential investors and broker-dealers,
but no terms have been agreed upon. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable
to us, or at all. Any equity financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders. We do not currently have any contractual restrictions
on our ability to incur debt and, accordingly we could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance operations. Any such indebtedness
could contain covenants which would restrict our operations. 

40 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has
defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial
condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often because
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

Based
on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed which are described in Note 2 to our
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions,
and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these
estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

We
are exposed to market risk, including changes in certain interest rates. All these market risks arise in the normal course of business,
as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. We have not entered derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection
with such fluctuations. 

This
analysis does not take into consideration the effect of changes in the level of overall economic activity on interest rate fluctuations. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 13a-15(b), we have carried out an evaluation
(the Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our management, and the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below, in order to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure (see below for further discussion).We had
neither the resources, nor the personnel, to provide an adequate control environment. 

41 

Due
to our limited resources, the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at September
30, 2024: 

We
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

we
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited size
 and early-stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically
 feasible; however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
 should be performed by separate individuals; 

we
 do not have an independent audit committee of our Board of Directors; 

insufficient
 monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge
 of GAAP that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements; and 

we
 continue to outsource the functions of controller on an interim basis to assist us in implementing the necessary financial controls
 over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal management and staff to effectuate these controls. 

We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily related, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems. 

If
and when our financial resources allow, we plan to take a number of actions to correct these material weaknesses including, but not limited
to, establishing an audit committee of our Board of Directors comprised of three independent directors, hiring a full-time Chief Financial
Officer, adding experienced accounting and financial personnel and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls
and recommend improvements. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

42 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings 

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past ten years concerning our directors or officers which involved a criminal
conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one s participation in the securities or banking
industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations. 

From
time to time we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the operation of our business in the normal course of
business. Other than as described below, as of the date of this Registration Statement we are not aware of potential dispute or pending
litigation and are not currently involved in a litigation proceeding or governmental actions the outcome of which in management s
opinion would be material to our financial condition or results of operations. An adverse result in these or other matters may have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company received a Wells Notice which advised that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has made a preliminary
determination to recommend that the Commission file an enforcement action against GiveMePower, Inc. The Notice showed that the proposed
action would allege violations of Securities Act of 1933 Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3); and Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a), (b), (c) thereunder; and Exchange Act Sections 13(a)
and 13(k) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. The Notice s recommendation may involve a civil injunctive action and the commission
may seek remedies that include an injunction and civil money penalties. The Company s attorneys are presently working on an appropriate
response to the Notice. 

As
of November 19, 2024, the date of this report, there was no material proceeding to which any of our directors, officers, affiliates or
stockholders is a party adverse to us. During the past ten years, no present director, executive officer or person nominated to become

officer appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or

within ten years before the time of such filing;
