. The rate will be revised, if necessary, as of the end of each successive interim
period during our fiscal year to our best current estimate. The Company s income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid or refunded. Significant judgments and estimates are required
in determining the income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement
recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating the Company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, management considers
all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company develops assumptions including
the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible
and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and the
assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company is using to manage its underlying businesses. Changes in tax
laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company s policy is to recognize
interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company evaluates its tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in the course of preparing its tax returns to determine whether the tax positions will more likely than not be sustained by
the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are not recorded as a tax benefit or
expense in the current year. No reserve for uncertain tax positions has been recorded. 

 The estimated annual effective tax rate is
applied to the year-to-date ordinary income (loss) at the end of the interim period. 

 ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. This pronouncement also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. 

Royalty income is recognized in accordance
with agreed upon terms, when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
assured. 

 Rental income from space leased to our tenants
is recognized in the month in which it is due, which approximates if it were recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
related lease. We lease 2,774 square feet of our total space) to one tenant pursuant to a lease that expires , with
the rate determined by referring to prevailing market rates. The lease does not have an option to renew or extend. 

 On occasion we receive customer deposits
for future product orders and product developments. Customer deposits are initially recorded as a liability and recognized as
revenue when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer, or when agreed milestones are met in the case of product
developments. 

 The following is the disaggregation of revenue
into broad categories, which we have defined as shown below for the three months and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q. Certain statements contained in this section are not historical facts, including statements about our strategies
and expectations about new and existing products, market demand, acceptance of new and existing products, technologies and opportunities,
market and industry segment growth, and return on investments in products and markets. These statements are forward-looking
statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and we intend such forward-looking statements to be covered
by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in these statutes. You can identify forward-looking
statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will,"

 Overview 

Lifeloc Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation
("Lifeloc", "Company", We , Us , Our , Them ), is a Colorado-based developer,
manufacturer and marketer of portable hand-held and fixed station breathalyzers and related accessories, supplies and education. 
We design, produce and sell fuel-cell based breath alcohol testing equipment. We compete in all major segments of the portable
breath alcohol testing instrument market, including law enforcement, workplace, corrections, original equipment manufacturing ("OEM")
and consumer markets. In addition, we offer a line of supplies, accessories, services, and training to support customers' alcohol testing
programs. We sell globally through distributors as well as directly to users. 

We define our business as providing "near and
remote sensing and monitoring" products and solutions. Today, the majority of our revenues are derived from products and services
for alcohol detection and measurement. We remain committed to growing our breath alcohol testing business. In the future, we anticipate
the commercialization of new sensing and measurement products that may allow Lifeloc to successfully expand our business into new growth
areas where we do not presently compete or where no satisfactory product solutions exist today. 

In addition, with the October 2014 purchase of our
corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property, we added a new reporting segment focused on the ownership and rental of real property
through existing commercial leases. 

Lifeloc incorporated in Colorado in December 1983. We
filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on May 31, 2011. Our
fiscal year end is December 31. Our principal executive offices are located at 12441 West 49th Avenue, Unit 4, Wheat Ridge, Colorado
80033-3338. Our telephone number is (303) 431-9500. Our websites are www.lifeloc.com and www.stsfirst.com. Information
contained on our websites does not constitute part of this Form 10-K. 

Outlook 

Installed Base of Breathalyzers . We
believe the installed base of our breathalyzers will increase as the inherent risks associated with drinking while driving or while working
in safety sensitive jobs become more widely acknowledged and as our network of distributors and our direct sales force grows. We
believe that increased marketing efforts, the introduction of new products and the expansion of our sales network may provide the basis
for increased sales and continuing profitable operations. However, these measures, or any others that we may adopt or determine
not to adopt, may not result in either increased sales or continuing profitable operations. 

Possibility of Operating Losses. Over
many of the past several years we have operated profitably; however, prior to that, and in 2021 through 2023, we incurred losses. Those
losses are continuing in 2024 and we expect them to continue in 2025 as we continue to work toward the commercialization of SpinDx. There
is no assurance that we will not incur losses in any given quarter or year in the future. 

Sales Growth . We expect to increase
sales in the U.S. and worldwide as our network of direct customers and distributors grows and becomes more proficient and expands the
number of new accounts. Our growth efforts have focused on expanding our global reach and broadening our product offering in
alcohol and drug detection. Orders for all of our products, particularly ignition interlock components, are on an intermittent purchase
order basis and there is no assurance they will continue at any given rate, or that orders will repeat. 

15 

Sales and Marketing Expenses. We
continue our efforts to expand our domestic and international distribution capability, and we believe that sales and marketing expenses
will need to be maintained at a healthy level in order to do so. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase as we
increase our direct sales representatives and marketing efforts. 

Research and Development Expenses . We
expect to increase our research and development expenses to support refinements to our products, and the development of additional new
products. 

SpinDx 

In August 2016 we entered into an exclusive patent
license agreement with Sandia Corporation pursuant to which we acquired the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and market Sandia's
patented SpinDx technology for the detection of drugs of abuse. We believe this license agreement represents the beginning of a
relationship that will become material to the Company in the near future. A prototype was built by Sandia under our Cooperative Research
and Development Agreement and received in 2018, after which we commenced work on commercializing the device. This effort was hampered
by the pandemic, but with the recovery, our full attention has been given to SpinDx. Although the patents to the base technology belong
to Sandia, any improvements we make that are patentable belong solely to Lifeloc. The first Lifeloc-owned utility patent application was
filed in February 2024. 

In the first nine months of 2024 we purchased SpinDx
related test and other equipment totaling 244,872 and in 2023 0. In addition, during the first nine months of 2024 we invested 147,615
in space required for SpinDx related work that is not yet in service. We are estimating that completing and equipping this lab space will
require an additional 150,000 during Q4 of 2024. Purchasing specialized equipment for the production of certain SpinDx components will
require additional significant outlays, the total of which has not been determined. We are optimistic about the results of the work to
date and expect market introduction via beta testing later in Q4 of 2024, which will continue in 2025, with a sales-ready device later
in 2025. SpinDx uses a centrifugal disk with micro fluidic flow paths allowing multiple tests to be carried out on a single small
sample. The SpinDx platform has the potential to revolutionize real-time screening for a panel of high abuse drugs, with
the ability to quickly and quantitatively measure very low concentrations of drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl
and others. We intend to use this technology, sometimes referred to as "Lab on a Disk", to develop devices and tests
that could be used at roadside, emergency rooms and in workplace testing to get a rapid measure for a panel of such drugs of abuse with
a quantitative measure for delta-9-THC. In our laboratory, we have detected delta-9-THC (the primary psychoactive component of marijuana)
down to concentrations of 5 nanograms per milliliter in spiked saliva samples and down to 10 nanograms per milliliter in samples obtained
from human users. This includes resolving the psychoactive delta-9-THC from its inactive metabolites. Resolving the psychoactive
levels from metabolites is an important step in establishing impairment which is an important differentiation from competitive devices.
We expect the initial release of the new product will consist of the SpinDx base reader unit, an oral fluid collection device and an analysis
disk. We expect subsequent product releases will utilize the same SpinDx base reader and collection devices for samples from blood and
from breath. We completed the upgrade of our base breathalyzer platform in 2019 (the LX9), and we remain committed to combining it with
the SpinDx technology. If successful, this combination will result in a marijuana breathalyzer. 

R.A.D.A.R. 

 On March 8, 2017, we entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Track Group Inc., a Delaware corporation. Pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired certain assets comprised of: (1) handheld hardware device technology (the "R.A.D.A.R. 
Mobile Devices"), designed to measure breath alcohol content of the user; and (2) software technology called R.A.D.A.R. (Real-time
Alcohol Detection and Reporting) Reporting Center designed to allow the Device to be configured and to capture and manage the data being
returned from the Device (together with the Device, the "R.A.D.A.R. Assets"). We purchased the assets of R.A.D.A.R. 100
knowing the product needed significant upgrading, which was essentially completed and released for sale several years later as R.A.D.A.R.
200. This product met with little market acceptance as a result of the underperformance of one feature. We withdrew R.A.D.A.R. 200 from
the market and outsourced the development of R.A.D.A.R. 300 to a third party but which is currently on hold as a result of focusing all
of our effort on SpinDx. 

 Results of Operations 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023 . 

Supply chain problems caused by Covid-19, as well as the other market impacts
of Covid-19, were mostly resolved by the end of 2023. After meeting pent up demand in 2023 and the first half of 2024, sales in the third
quarter of 2024 reverted back to pre-Covid levels. We maintained our reduced costs at their 2023 levels where possible, although inflation
took its toll, increasing the cost of raw materials, labor, and freight. We continued and intensified our new product development efforts
while maintaining the high level of customer service that has led to an excellent reputation for outstanding customer service. With the
introduction of new products and reduction in research and development costs once current R D efforts are completed, we believe Lifeloc
will again be profitable.

Net sales. 

Our product sales for the quarter ended September
30, 2024 were 2,075,994, a decrease of 600,878 (22 from 2,676,872 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. When royalties of
 3,016 and rental income of 8,316 are included, total revenues of 2,087,326 were down by 608,182 over the same quarter a year ago.
Rental income decreased by 5,257 due to our election not to renew or replace a lease for a portion of the space formerly occupied by
a tenant, and royalties decreased by 2,047 due to a decrease in sales by royalty-paying customers. 

Gross profit. 

Total gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 911,952 represented a decrease of 19 from total gross profit of 1,119,391 for the same three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of decreased sales without a decrease in fixed costs, as well as increased cost of materials and labor resulting from inflation. Cost of product sales decreased from 1,552,930 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,164,947 in the same period in 2024, a decrease of 387,983 (25 ). Gross profit margin on products increased to 44 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 42 in the same period a year ago primarily as a result of an increase in sales resulting from resolution with a customer regarding a deposit which did not involve any cost of goods. 

Research and development expenses. 

Research and development expenses were relatively
unchanged at 521,107 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 representing an increase of 4,933 (1 over the 516,174 in the same period
a year ago. 

Sales and marketing expenses. 

Sales and marketing expenses of 329,716 for the 3
months ended September 30, 2024 were up by 19,818 (or 6 from the 309,898 spent in the same period a year ago, as a result of expanded
marketing efforts, including the addition of personnel. 

General and administrative expenses. 

General and administrative expenses of 269,450 for
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were relatively unchanged from 269,593 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

Other income (expense). 

Interest income decreased from 17,678 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to 9,525 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of lower funds availability. Interest
expense of 10,019 in the 3 months ended September 30, 2024 was down from 10,494 in the previous year as a result of the paydown on our
loan on our building. 

Net income (loss). 

We realized a net loss of 158,327 for the 3 months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 109,603 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 267,930 was
the result of the changes in gross profit, operating expenses and other income discussed above, which resulted in a loss before taxes
of 208,815, or a decrease of 239,725 from the profit before taxes of 30,910 in 2023, and after the benefit from taxes of 50,488 versus
a benefit from taxes of 78,693 in the same three months a year ago. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 . 

Net sales. 

Our product sales for the first nine months of 2024
were 6,580,861, a decrease of 7 , or 475,777 for the same period in 2023. When royalties of 22,776 and rental income of 24,462
are included, total revenues of 6,628,099 were down by 512,309 over the same nine months a year ago. Rental income decreased by 35,889
due to our election not to renew or replace a lease for a portion of the space formerly occupied by a tenant, and royalties decreased
by 643 due to a decrease in sales by royalty-paying customers. 

Gross profit. 

Total gross profit for the 9 months ended September 30, 2024 of 2,740,855 represented a decrease of 12 from total gross profit of 3,097,262 for the same nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of lower sales without a decrease in fixed costs, as well as increased cost of materials and labor resulting from inflation. Cost of product sales decreased from 4,009,495 in the 9 months ended September 30, 2023 to 3,869,977 in the same period in 2024, a decrease of 139,518 (3 ). Gross profit margin on products decreased to 41 in the 9 months ended September 30, 2024 from 43 in the same period a year ago. 

Research and development expenses were 1,738,982
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 representing an increase of 430,261 (33 over the 1,308,721 in the same period a year
ago. This increase resulted primarily from additional personnel, materials and outside contractors needed for our dedication
of resources to SpinDx. 

Sales and marketing expenses. 

Sales and marketing expenses of 1,040,099 for the
9 months ended September 30, 2024 were up by 142,243 (or 16 from the 897,856 spent in the same period a year ago, as a result of expanded
marketing efforts, personnel, web site and other similar items. 

General and administrative expenses. 

General and administrative expenses of 947,384 for
the 9 months ended September 30, 2024 versus 872,724 for the same period ended September 30, 2023 were up by 74,660 (9 ). This increase
was the result of across the board inflationary increases. 

Other income (expense). 

Interest income decreased from 46,678 a year ago
to 35,874 in 2024, as a result of lower funds availability. Interest expense of 30,226 in the 9 months ended September 30, 2024
was down from 31,319 in the previous year as a result of the paydown on our loan on our building. 

Net income (loss). 

We realized a net loss of 740,121 for the 9 months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 110,960 for the same 9 months ended September 30, 2023. This negative swing of
 851,081 was the result of the changes in gross profit, operating expenses and other income discussed above, which resulted in a loss
before taxes of 979,962, or an increased loss of 1,013,282 from the profit before taxes of 33,320 in 2023. After the benefit from taxes
of 239,841 versus the benefit from taxes of 77,640 in the same period a year ago, we realized a net loss of 740,121 compared to net
income of 110,960 in 2023. 

Trends and Uncertainties That May Affect Future Results. 

Revenues in the year 2024 were down compared to revenues
in 2023. We believe that continued increased sales efforts may result in modestly improved revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024
and beyond. Inflationary pressures have affected our business in a number of ways, including increasing the cost of raw materials,
labor, and freight. Our actions to mitigate the impact of inflation, including pre-ordering components in higher than usual quantities,
sourcing new vendors and increasing prices, have been somewhat successful. 

We expect our quarter-to-quarter revenue fluctuations
to continue, due to the unpredictable timing of large orders from customers and the size of those orders in relation to total revenues. Going
forward, we intend to focus our development efforts on products we believe offer the best prospects to increase our intermediate and near-term
revenues, with particular emphasis on completing SpinDx . 

Our operating plan for the remainder of 2024 is focused
on growing sales, increasing gross profits, and continuing research and development efforts on new products, including SpinDx ,
for long-term growth. We cannot predict with certainty the expected sales, gross profit, net income or loss, or usage of cash and cash
equivalents for 2024. However, we believe that cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months under
our current operating plan. If we are unable to manage the business operations in line with our budget expectations, it could have a material
adverse effect on business viability, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, if we are not successful in sustaining
profitability and remaining at least cash flow break-even, additional borrowings or capital may be required to maintain ongoing operations. 

Interest expense . 

In connection with the financing of our building purchase on October 31, 2014 we obtained a 10-year term loan from Bank of America in an initial principal amount of 1,581,106 bearing interest at 4.45 per annum (which was decreased to 4 in 2016) and secured by a first-priority mortgage in the acquired property, as well as a one-year 250,000 line of credit, which was later increased to 750,000 with a maturity date of September 28, 2021. The Bank of America loan was paid on September 30, 2021 with proceeds from a new term loan from Citywide Banks, also secured by a first-priority mortgage on the property, in the principal amount of 1,350,000. The new loan is payable in monthly installments of 7,453, with interest at 2.95 and a maturity date of September 30, 2031. The revolving line of credit facility expired in accordance with its terms. In July 2024, we obtained a new 750,000 line of credit from Citywide Banks with a maturity date of one year and a variable interest rate determined by SOFR (Secured Overnight Rate Financing) plus 2.75 payable monthly. As of September 30, 2024 this line of credit had not been accessed and no balance was due on the loan. 

17 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We compete in a highly technical, very competitive
and, in most cases, price driven alcohol testing marketplace, where products can take years to develop and introduce to distributors and
end users. Furthermore, manufacturing, marketing and distribution activities are regulated by the DOT and other regulatory
bodies that, while intended to enhance the ultimate quality and functionality of products produced, can contribute to the cost and time
needed to maintain existing products and develop and introduce new products. 

Except for normal operating contractual commitments
and purchase orders, we do not have any material contractual commitments requiring settlement in the future. 

We have traditionally funded working capital needs
through product sales and close management of working capital components of our business. Historically, we have also received
cash from private offerings of our common stock, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and notes. In our earlier
years, we incurred quarter to quarter operating losses to develop current product applications, utilizing a number of proprietary and
patent-pending technologies. Although we have been profitable in recent years except 2020 and 2022, we can provide no assurances
that operating losses will not occur in the future. Should that situation arise, we may not be able to obtain working capital
funds necessary in the time frame needed and at satisfactory terms, if at all. 

As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents
was 841,621, trade accounts receivable were 611,439 and current liabilities were 783,779 resulting in net liquid assets of 669,281. We
believe that the resolution of supply chain issues and the Covid-19 pandemic, and the introduction of several new products during the
last several years, along with new and on-going customer relationships will allow Lifeloc to operate profitably. If the revenue levels
during the last several years do not continue to grow, if inflationary pressures are not contained, or if the development of SpinDx takes
longer than expected, we may be required to seek additional sources of borrowings or capital and/or to implement further cost reduction
measures, as necessary. 

Equipment expenditures, consisting of space modifications,
updated office and production equipment, and SpinDx related equipment and lab space during the first nine months of 2024 were 625,238,
including 195,036 of equipment not yet in service, compared to 21,611 in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 603,627. We
incurred patent application costs in preparation for filing of 21,708 in 2024 versus 1,404 in 2023. We are estimating that completing
and equipping the lab space will require an additional 150,000 during the fourth quarter of 2024. As development of SpinDx progresses,
and as normal wear and tear of equipment occurs, we expect to continue to incur outlays for equipment and patent filings in 2024
and beyond. 

We generally provide a standard one-year limited warranty
on materials and workmanship to our customers. We provide for estimated warranty costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Warranty
costs are included as a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying statements of operations. For the quarter ended
September 30, 2024 and for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, warranty costs were not deemed significant. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and
estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience,
on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and
circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, sales returns, deferred tax assets, warranty,
contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

We have concluded that we have two operating segments,
including our primary business which is as a developer, manufacturer and marketer of portable hand-held breathalyzers and related accessories,
supplies and education, and a second segment consisting of renting portions of our building to existing tenants. 

18 

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers
were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required, which would
increase our expenses during the periods in which any such allowances were made. The amount recorded as a provision for bad
debts in each period is based upon our assessment of the likelihood that we will be paid on our outstanding receivables, based on customer-specific
as well as general considerations. To the extent that our estimates prove to be too high, and we ultimately collect a receivable
previously determined to be impaired, we may record a reversal of the provision in the period of such determination. 

We reduce inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand
and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory
write-downs may be required. Any write-downs of inventory would reduce our reported net income during the period in which
such write-downs were applied. 

Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation computed over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally five years (three years for software and technology licenses). We use the declining method of depreciation
for property, including space modifications, and the straight line method for software and technology licenses. We purchased all
of the assets of STS, an online education company, in 2014, which consisted of training courses that are amortized over 15 years using
the straight line method. In October 2014, we purchased our building. A majority of the cost of the building is depreciated over
39 years using the straight line method. In addition, based on the results of a third party analysis, a portion of the cost was allocated
to components integral to the building. Such components are depreciated over 5 and 15 years, using the declining method. 
The R.A.D.A.R. software and patents that were purchased in March 2017 were originally set to amortize over 15 years using the straight
line method, but in 2022 we accelerated the amortization of the remaining cost to fully amortize the assets by December 31, 2022. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred and major additions, replacements and improvements are capitalized. 

Revenue from product sales and supplies is generally
recorded when we ship the product and title has passed to the customer, or when agreed milestones are met in the case of product developments,
provided that we have evidence of a customer arrangement and can conclude that collection is probable. The prices at which
we sell our products are fixed and determinable at the time we accept a customer's order. We recognize revenue from sales to stocking
distributors when there is no right of return, other than for normal warranty claims, and generally have no ongoing obligations related
to product sales, except for normal warranty. 

The sales of licenses to our training courses are
recognized as revenue at the time of sale. Direct training performed by us is recognized when training is completed by the trainer, with
the unearned portion classified as deferred revenue. Training and certification revenues are recognized at the time the training and certification occurs. 
Data recording revenue is recognized based on each day s usage of enrolled devices. 

Revenues arising from extended warranty contracts
are booked as sales over their life on a straight-line basis. We provide customer financing and leasing ourselves, which we recognize
as revenue over the applicable lease term. Occasionally, we rent used equipment to customers, and in those cases, we recognize
the revenues as they are earned over the life of the contract. 

Royalty income is recognized in accordance with agreed
upon terms, when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 

Rental income from space leased to our tenants is
recognized in the month in which it is due. 

On occasion we receive customer deposits for future
product orders and for product development. Customer deposits are initially recorded as a liability and recognized as revenue
when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer, or in the case of product development, when agreed milestones are met. 

Stock-based compensation is presented in accordance
with the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic
718, Compensation Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"). Under the provisions of ASC 718, companies are required
to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated
fair values on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected
to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our statement of operations.

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 (a) Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 As of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

 (b) Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 There were no significant changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

 A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will
be met. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that the Company's
disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The
design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

 ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

 We may be involved from time to time in litigation,
negotiation and settlement matters that may have a material effect on our operations or finances. We are not aware of any pending
or threatened litigation against us or our officers or directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact on our operations
or finances. 

 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 

 In addition to the other information set forth
in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in ''Risk Factors'' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or future results. The risks described
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known
to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating
results. 

 ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

 On July 23, 2024, we sold 210,000 shares of
common stock to EDCO Partners LLLP, an accredited investor, in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D of the
Securities Act. The purchase price under the Private Placement was 3.80 per share, for a total of 798,000 in proceeds to Lifeloc. There
were no discounts or commissions paid to underwriters or placement agents. There were no sales of equity securities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

 No options were exercised during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 or during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
