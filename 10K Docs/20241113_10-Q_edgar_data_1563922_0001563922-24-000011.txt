As of January 17, 2024, the Company ceased offering the shares under the previously effective registration statement, and pursuant to the Company s new registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-276532), the Company is offering up to million in Class A, C and I shares to its existing Class A, C and I shareholders pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated DRP. No dealer manager fees, selling commissions or other sales charges will be paid with respect to shares issued pursuant to the DRP except for distribution fees on Class C, P-S and P-T shares (as discussed in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies). At its discretion, the Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the DRP as well as modify or waive the terms of the DRP with respect to certain or all shareholders, in its discretion, to be in the best interests of the Company. A participant may terminate the election to participate in the DRP by written notice to the plan administrator received by the plan administrator at least 10 days prior to the distribution payment date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company issued million Class A shares, million Class C shares, million Class I shares, million Class P-A shares, million Class P-I shares, thousand Class P-D shares, million Class P-S shares, and thousand Class P-T shares for a total of million aggregate shares issued under the DRP.

 The Company suspended the payment of shareholder distributions effective following the distribution payment on May 1, 2024. In connection with suspending shareholder distributions, the Company also suspended the DRP which was offered to shareholders who could elect to have the full amount of cash distributions reinvested in additional shares. As a result of the suspension of shareholders distributions and the DRP, shareholders will not be able to purchase additional shares through the DRP until such time, if any, as the Board of Directors affirmatively authorizes the recommencement of the shareholder distributions and the DRP. However, the Company can make no such assurances as to whether this will happen or the timing or terms of any recommencement.

 b. if the Liquidation Performance Participation Distribution is payable as a result of a Listing, the Liquidation Performance Participation Distribution will equal of any premium the Company receives from the Listing. Additionally, the Liquidation Performance Participation Distribution shall be payable by converting the LPU into a number of newly issued Class P-I shares equal to the Liquidation Performance Participation Distribution divided by the Class P-I share value as of the first month end following the 30th trading day following such an IPO. 
 Since none of the events that would trigger the Liquidation Performance Participation Distribution was considered probable to occur, liability was recognized related to the LPU as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Additionally, certain employees of the Company received profits interest units from the LPU Holder in exchange for employment services. Since the LPU Holder does not have any other operations or assets, the distribution an employee grantee shall receive from these profits interest units is the equivalent of the Liquidation Performance Participation Distribution the Company shall make to the LPU Holder. The Company has determined that the profits interest units do not represent a substantive class of the Company s equity, and therefore, shall account for the potential distribution to employees as a payable in accordance with ASC Topic 710, Compensation General. Since none of the events that would trigger the distribution was considered probable to occur, liability was recognized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and compensation expense was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The use of we , us , our and the Company refer, collectively to the Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company LLC and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or context otherwise requires. This Quarterly Report does not constitute an offer of any of the Company s managed funds described herein. 
 
 Organizational Overview 
 Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company LLC (the Company or GREC LLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed in December 2012. The Company is an energy transition, renewable energy and investment management IM company that acquires, constructs and operates renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, as well as finances the construction and/or operation of these and other sustainable development projects and businesses and provides through Greenbacker Capital Management LLC GCM investment management services to funds within the sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy industry. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s fleet comprised 425 renewable energy projects with an aggregate power production capacity of approximately 3.2 gigawatts GW ), which includes operating capacity of approximately 1.6 GW and pre-operational capacity of approximately 1.6 GW. As of September 30, 2024, GCM serves as the registered investment adviser of four funds in the sustainable and renewable energy industry. 
 The Company conducts substantially all its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, Greenbacker Renewable Energy Corporation GREC ). The Company operates as a fully integrated and internally managed company after acquiring GCM and several other related entities, which are now wholly owned subsidiaries of GREC. The Company s fiscal year-end is December 31. 
 The Company previously conducted continuous public offerings of Class A, C, and I shares of limited liability company interests, along with Class A, C, and I shares pursuant to the Company s DRP. The public offerings were initially commenced in August 2013 and terminated March 29, 2019, raising a total of 253.4 million. The Company also privately offered Class P-A, P-I, P-D, P-T and P-S shares. These private offerings were conducted between April 2016 and March 16, 2022, raising a total of 1.4 billion. 
 The Company suspended the payment of shareholder distributions effective following the distribution payment on May 1, 2024. In connection with suspending shareholder distributions, the Company also suspended the DRP which was offered to shareholders who could elect to have the full amount of cash distributions reinvested in additional shares.

 For an organizational structure chart depicting a simplified version of our structure, see Part I Item 1. Business Organizational Overview in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. 
 Business Overview 
 The Company s business objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders, consisting of both current income and long-term capital appreciation, by acquiring and financing the construction and/or operation of income-generating renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development projects, primarily within North America, as well as by providing investment management services to funds within the sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy industry where the Company expects to receive investment management and incentive fees. 
 The Company operates with the capabilities of both an actively managed owner-operator of renewable energy businesses and as an active third-party investment manager of other funds within the sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy industry. The Company currently operates in two reportable segments described below. 
 IPP The IPP business represents the active management and operations of the Company's fleet of renewable energy projects, including those in late-stage development and under construction. The Company's renewable energy projects generally earn revenue through the sale of generated electricity as well as frequently through the sale of other commodities such as RECs. In certain cases, the Company also serves as a minority member in renewable energy projects where it does not actively manage and operate the project but receives periodic dividends. The Company also provides loans to developers for the construction of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects as an incremental revenue stream for IPP.

 The IPP business includes the direct costs to operate the Company's fleet, including costs such as operations and maintenance, repairs, and other costs incurred at the project / site level. Additionally, the Company employs a dedicated team of technical asset managers as well as a construction team to oversee the development and operations of our fleet. Such costs are recorded as Direct operating costs for IPP. 
 The IPP business also includes the allocable portion of the Company s General and administrative expenses, which represents overhead functions such as: finance and accounting, legal, information technology, human resources and other general functions that support the operations of IPP.

 Seasonality 
 Certain types of renewable power generation may exhibit seasonal behavior. For example, wind power generation is generally stronger in winter than in summer as wind speed tends to be higher when the weather is colder. In contrast, solar power generation is typically stronger in the summer than in the winter. This is primarily due to the brighter sunshine, longer days and shorter nights of the summer months, which generally result in the highest power output of the year for solar power. Because these seasonal variations are relatively predictable for these types of assets, we factor in the effects of seasonality when analyzing a potential acquisition in these target assets. Therefore, the impact that seasonality may have on our business, including the income from our renewable energy projects, will depend on the diversity of our acquisitions in renewable energy, energy efficiency and other sustainability-related projects in our overall portfolio. However, to the extent our acquisitions are concentrated in either solar or wind power, we expect our business to be seasonal based on the mix of renewable power generation technology. 
 
 Presentation of Key Factors Impacting Our Operating Results and Financial Condition 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges. Please see the factors discussed in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including those discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for additional information. 
 General Market Risks 
 Our business and the success of our strategies are affected by global and domestic economic, political and market conditions generally and including the local economic conditions where its assets are located. Certain external events such as public health crises (e.g., COVID-19), natural disasters and geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and the more recent Middle East conflict, have recently led to increased financial and credit market volatility and disruptions, leading to record inflationary pressure, changes in interest rates, supply chain issues, labor shortages and recessionary concerns. The Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates during 2024; however, there is no guarantee further reductions in interest rates may occur. The full impact of such external events on the financial and credit markets and consequently on the Company s future financial conditions and results of operations is uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. We will continue to monitor these events and will adjust our operations as necessary. 
 Size of Fleet 
 The size of our fleet of operating renewable energy projects is a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our operating fleet grows, the amount of revenue we receive will increase. In addition, our fleet of renewable energy projects may grow at an uneven pace, as opportunities to make investments in our target assets may be irregularly timed, and the timing and extent of our success in acquiring such assets, cannot be predicted. 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 Credit Risk 
 We expect to encounter credit risk relating to (1) counterparties to the electricity sales agreements (including power purchase agreements) for our projects, (2) counterparties responsible for project construction and equipment supply, (3) companies in which we may invest and (4) any potential debt financing we or our projects may obtain. When we are able to do so, we seek to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts with high quality counterparties. However, it is still possible that these counterparties may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. 
 If counterparties to the electricity sales agreements for our projects or the companies in which we invest are unable to make payments to us when due, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. While we seek to mitigate construction related credit risk by entering into contracts with high quality EPCs with appropriate bonding and insurance capacity, if EPCs to the construction agreements for our projects are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, our financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. 
 Pre-Operational Assets 
 The number of pre-operational renewable energy projects in our IPP business is a significant factor in our future revenue streams. As the Company acquires additional pre-operational assets, we must finalize construction and reach commercial operations before revenue is generated. We believe these assets, once operational, have the potential to generate significant operating revenues and cash flow for our business. 
 Electricity Prices 
 Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects and businesses expose us to volatility in the market prices of electricity. Although we generally seek projects that have long-term contracts, ranging from 10 to 25 years, which mitigate the effects of volatility in energy prices on our business, to the extent that our projects have shorter term contracts that have the potential of producing higher risk-adjusted returns, such shorter term contracts may subject us to risk should energy prices change. 
 Generally, our projects benefit from take-or-pay agreements, with terms structured to take 100 of the power output. We believe the take-or-pay nature of our contracts is a significant factor in managing our exposure to the daily volatility of the electricity market prices. On average, the contracts in our existing operating portfolio have an approximate remaining life of 18 years. 
 Impact of Government Incentives 
 The renewable energy and energy efficiency sector attracts significant U.S. federal, state and local government support and incentives to address technical barriers to the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and to promote the use of renewable energy and energy-saving strategies. These U.S. federal, state and local government incentives have historically functioned to increase (1) the revenue generated by, and (2) the equity returns available from, renewable energy projects. Energy efficiency projects are also eligible to receive government incentives at the U.S. federal, state and local levels that can be applied to offset project development costs. Governments in other jurisdictions also provide several types of incentives. 
 Corporate entities are eligible to receive benefits through tax credits, such as PTCs, ITCs, tax deductions, accelerated depreciation and U.S. federal grants and loan guarantees (from the U.S. Department of Energy, for instance), as described below. 
 U.S. Federal Incentives: 
 Corporate Depreciation: Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System MACRS 
 Under MACRS, owners of renewable energy and some energy efficiency projects can recover capital invested through accelerated depreciation, which reduces the payment of corporate tax. Bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code was extended and modified by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA ). Businesses can now immediately deduct 100 of the cost of eligible property in the year it is placed in service, through 2022. For property placed in service in 2023, the bonus depreciation percentage will drop to 80 , and then phase down by 20 each year until it expires after 2026. Also, the TCJA eliminated the rule that made bonus depreciation available only for new property. The changes in the TCJA provided more flexibility than the prior bonus depreciation rules in that they permit a taxpayer to depreciate an asset that is not new; however, the asset must be acquired from a third party in an arm s-length sale.

 On August 16, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the IRA into law, ratifying the most significant climate legislation in U.S. history. The IRA s 369 billion federal package is designed to enhance U.S. energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase domestic development, employment, and investment in the clean energy sector, and ultimately tackle the climate crisis. This landmark legislation makes decarbonization a national priority of the United States and serves as an acknowledgement of the urgency of the global climate crisis. 
 According to Princeton University's Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit Project REPEAT ), the IRA would drive nearly 3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investments into the energy industry through the next decade and cut annual emissions in 2030 by an additional ~1 billion metric tons below current policy, which would be 50 below 2005 levels. REPEAT projects an increase to 49 GW of solar deployed per year by 2025, which is approximately five times higher than capacity additions in 2020.

 Independent Power Producer 
 Energy Revenue 
 Energy revenue within the IPP segment primarily represents revenues associated with the sale of electricity under our long-term PPAs as well as from REC sales. The Company also generates energy revenue from capacity markets, whereby revenue is generated for our ability to meet peak demand if and when needed. The Company also generates revenues through performing energy optimization services for customers, which includes providing a battery storage system and services. 
 Intangible assets and liabilities recognized from PPAs and REC contracts related to the sale of energy or RECs in future periods for which the fair value has been determined to be less or more than market are amortized to revenue over the term of each underlying contract on a straight-line basis. 
 Energy revenue from the IPP segment was 48.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.7 million, or 10.7 , compared to the same period for 2023. PPA revenue is impacted by the underlying availability of the natural resource (i.e., wind or solar) and the underlying mix of operating assets by technology type. 
 The increase in Energy revenue is primarily driven by an increase of 4.5 million in Energy revenue generated by the Company s operating solar fleet to Energy revenue to 28.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to additional assets being placed in operation during and subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Energy revenue within the period is also driven by an increase of 2.9 million in Energy revenue generated by the Company s operating wind fleet to 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased production from the Company s restarted wind repower projects from 2023 and a large wind asset that was under repair in 2023 and higher than expected wind resources for generation. This was offset by reduction in revenue due to the EVCE bankruptcy. Refer to Electricity Production by Our Fleet below for additional information on operational summary statistics for the Company s IPP fleet. 
 Other Revenue - IPP 
 Other revenue from the IPP segment was 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.5 million, or 20.7 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Other revenue within the period is primarily driven by a reduction in interest income from notes receivable held by the Company due to the repayment of notes receivable during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Contract Amortization, Net - IPP 
 Contract amortization, net within the IPP segment primarily represents amortization of intangible assets and out-of-market contracts recognized from PPA and REC contracts assumed through acquisitions related to the sale of energy in future periods for which the fair value has been determined to be less or more than market are amortized to revenue over the term of each underlying contract on a straight-line basis. 
 Contract amortization, net from the IPP segment was 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million, or 17.9 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Contract amortization, net is primarily driven by the impairment of certain PPA intangibles associated with a certain renewable energy asset in the third quarter of 2023 as well as an increase in amortization revenue due to certain unfavorable PPA intangibles for projects placed into service subsequent to the third quarter of 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Direct operating costs within the IPP segment represents the costs to operate our fleet of renewable energy projects, including operations and maintenance, site lease expense, project level insurance and property taxes, and other costs incurred at the project level. Additionally, the Company employs a dedicated team of technical asset managers to monitor the operational performance of the projects within IPP. The salaries, benefits and professional service costs directly related to the operations of IPP that are not capitalized are included within Direct operating costs in the table above and on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Direct operating costs excludes any depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. 
 Direct operating costs from the IPP segment were 37.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13.9 million, or 58.8 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in Direct operating costs in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the settlement agreement, the Company entered into with a third party vendor, resulting in a forfeiture of advance deposits of 16.0 million due to the termination of the existing purchase contract in order to acquire the solar panels needed for its development and construction pipeline from a different vendor with significantly better economic proposition due to reduced cash outlays. This was offset by lower operating costs from the deconsolidation of EVCE in April 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information on the deconsolidation of EVCE. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expense from the IPP segment was 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million, or 16.9 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in General and administrative expense is primarily related to additional expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023 for fees related to a terminated PPA. 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense from the IPP segment was 18.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 33.9 million, or 64.9 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense within the period primarily related to additional accelerated depreciation recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The Company engaged in three wind repower projects in 2023 where the existing assets retrofitted with new and/or refurbished technology, including erecting taller, more efficient wind turbines to increase productivity. Depreciation of fixed assets replaced was accelerated between the mobilization milestone date in the related EPC contract and the date of de-electrification of the project site. The Company accelerated 36.1 million of depreciation on the three wind repower projects during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets, net and project termination costs 
 Impairment of long-lived assets, net and project termination costs expense from the IPP segment was 26.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 24.3 million, or 47.9 , compared to the same period for 2023. The Company recorded an impairment of 12.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to two development-stage projects due to the termination of the PPAs by the offtaker subsequent to September 30, 2024 as a result of events of default for failure to meet existing contractual milestones under the applicable PPA contract as of September 30, 2024. The impairment analysis indicated that the projected future cash flows for the projects no longer supported the recoverability of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets. The total impairment included a 6.3 million loss on plant and equipment, a 2.9 million loss on ROU assets and assets associated with upfront payments that was due to the offtaker and a 3.5 million of Impairment of long-lived assets, net and project termination costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to favorable PPA contracts presented within Intangible assets, net. Additionally, the Company recorded 13.6 million in project termination fees for termination charges due to the notice of termination. In 2023, the Company determined that there was an impairment of an intangible asset contract, as such, recorded a charge of 50.7 million associated with a certain renewable energy asset of which, 7.0 million was associated with the plant and equipment asset for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the remainder of which was associated with the favorable PPA contract. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 8. Property, Plant and Equipment and Note 9. Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Out-of-market Contracts, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 
 Investment Management 
 Revenue 
 The IM segment and the related revenue will be driven by GCM s investment management platform through management fee and incentive, performance-based fee revenues from current and future third-party funds managed by GCM. The IM segment also generates administrative revenue from certain of its managed funds, from services performed by Greenbacker Administration. 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 The primary source of IM revenues are management fees and performance participation fees earned. Management fee revenue earned by our IM business are generally based upon the underlying net asset value, cost of investments or committed capital of GROZ, GDEV I, GDEV II and GREC II the managed funds for which GCM provides investment management services, primarily relating to capital raise and deployment as well as other investor relation functions for third party funds. For certain of our IM customers, the Company is also eligible to receive certain performance-based incentive fees. 
 An additional revenue source for the IM segment will include, for certain managed funds, administrative services performed by Greenbacker Administration. These services include technical asset management, finance and accounting, legal and other costs incurred by the Company in performing its administrative services. GCM managed funds will be charged their allocable portion of such costs with no margin. 
 Revenue from the IM segment was 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.0 million or 71.6 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in revenue within the period is primarily related to revenue earned from GREC II related to management and administrative fees as a result of the growth of assets under management at GREC II. Refer to Part I Item 1 , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Direct Operating Costs IM 
 Direct operating costs within the IM segment represents the costs for the investment management services for the managed funds. This includes the costs to raise and deploy capital for such funds. 
 Direct operating costs from the IM segment was 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.8 million, or 18.6 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Direct operating costs within the period is primarily related to lower administrative and business development related costs for the IM segment. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expense from the IM segment was 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.0 million, or 76.4 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in General and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase in salary and compensation related expenses due to increased headcount for various functions providing support to the IM segment as well as additional share-based compensation expense related to GDEV II incentive fees. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 17. Share-based Compensation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information on GDEV II incentive fees. 
 
 Corporate

 Non-operating income and expense 
 Interest (expense) income, net 
 Interest (expense) income, net was 21.1 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.4 million of income for the same period for 2023. The change is primarily driven by an increase in interest expense related to sale-leaseback transactions closed subsequent to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally the increase in expense was driven by the unfavorable changes in fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps due to expected rate cuts in interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 10. Debt and Note 11. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Change in fair value of investments, net 
 Change in fair value of investments, net was a gain of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 1.9 million for the same period for 2023. The change is primarily driven by the change in fair value of the Company s investments, primarily an increase in fair value for the Company s Aurora Solar investment. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 6. Fair Value Measurements and Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Benefit from income taxes 
 Benefit from income taxes was a 8.8 million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 11.5 million benefit for the same period for 2023. The change is primarily driven by a change in the Company s estimated effective tax rate to 2.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in estimated effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in the estimated tax impact from the Company s forecasted income attributable to GREC. This forecast changed to a smaller total net loss in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to larger non recurring charges recorded in 2023. 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.8 million for the same period for 2023. The change is primarily related to significant projects that were placed into service in 2023, resulting in difference in significant tax benefits being allocated to the Tax Equity Investor offset by a project that was placed into service in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in tax benefits being allocated to the Tax Equity Investors.

 Independent Power Producer 
 Energy Revenue 
 Energy revenue from the IPP segment was 143.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 17.2 million, or 14 , compared to the same period for 2023. PPA revenue is impacted by the underlying availability of the natural resource (i.e., wind or solar) and the underlying mix of operating assets by technology type. 
 The increase in Energy revenue is primarily driven by an increase of 10.7 million in Energy revenue generated by the Company s operating solar fleet to 71.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to additional assets being placed in operation during and subsequent to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Energy revenue within the period is also driven by an increase in Energy revenue generated by the Company s operating wind fleet of 7.3 million to 47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increased production from the Company s restarted wind repower projects from 2023. Refer to Electricity Production by Our Fleet below for additional information on operational summary statistics for the Company s IPP fleet.

 Other revenue from the IPP segment was 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.1 million, or 19 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Other revenue within the period is primarily related to a reduction in interest income from notes receivable held by the Company. 
 Contract Amortization, Net - IPP 
 Contract amortization, net from the IPP segment was 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 4.4 million, or 31.8 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Contract amortization, net is primarily driven by the full impairment of PPAs associated with EVCE in the third quarter of 2023 as well as an increase in amortization revenue due to certain unfavorable PPA intangibles for projects placed into service subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Direct Operating Costs - IPP 
 Nine months ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Change Change Operations and maintenance 47,076 31,339 15,737 50.2 Property taxes, insurance and site lease 24,074 20,431 3,643 17.8 Salaries and benefits, professional fees and other 9,542 14,002 (4,460) (31.9) Direct operating costs - IPP 80,692 65,772 14,920 22.7 
 Direct operating costs from the IPP segment were 80.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.9 million, or 23 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in Direct operating costs within the period is primarily related to increased operating costs from additional assets being placed in operation during and subsequent to September 30, 2023 and a settlement agreement with a third party vendor resulting in forfeiture of advance deposits 16.0 million due to the termination of the existing purchase contract in order to acquire the solar panels needed for its development and construction pipeline from a different vendor with significantly better economic proposition due to reduced cash outlays. This was partially offset by lower operating costs from the deconsolidation of EVCE in April 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as well as a gain from insurance proceeds from a damaged power transformer. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 8. Property, Plant and Equipment, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information on the deconsolidation of EVCE and the gain from insurance proceeds, respectively. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expense from the IPP segment was 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.8 million, or 17 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in General and administrative expense is primarily related to increase in salary and compensation related expenses due to increased headcount for various functions providing support to the IPP segment.

 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 
 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense from the IPP segment was 54.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 43.5 million, or 44 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense within the period is primarily related to additional accelerated depreciation in the second and third quarter of 2023. The Company engaged in three wind repower projects in 2023 where the existing assets retrofitted with new and/or refurbished technology, including erecting taller, more efficient wind turbines to increase productivity. Depreciation of fixed assets replaced was accelerated between the mobilization milestone date in the related EPC contract and the date of de-electrification of the project site. The Company accelerated 51.9 million of depreciation on the three wind repower projects during the year ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by additional assets being placed in service during and subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain on deconsolidation, net 
 Gain on deconsolidation, net from the IPP segment was 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. EVCE filed for a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Colorado. As a result of the Bankruptcy Filing, the Company was, no longer deemed to have a controlling interest in EVCE under applicable accounting standards. As a result, EVCE was deconsolidated from the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements as of April 17, 2024. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets, net and project termination costs 
 Impairment of long-lived assets, net and project termination costs from the IPP segment was 32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 18.0 million, or 35 , compared to the same period for 2023. The Company recognized an impairment of long-lived assets due to a change in state legislature that impacted the earnings potential on six projects for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment of 12.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to two development-stage projects due to the notice of termination of the PPAs by the offtaker subsequent to September 30, 2024 as a result of events of default for failure to meet existing contractual milestones under the applicable PPA contract as of September 30, 2024. The impairment analysis indicated that the projected future cash flows for the projects no longer supported the recoverability of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets. The total impairment included a 6.3 million loss on plant and equipment, a 2.9 million loss on ROU assets and assets associated with upfront payments that was due to the offtaker and a 3.5 million of Impairment of long-lived assets, net and project termination costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to favorable PPA contracts presented within Intangible assets, net. Additionally, the Company recorded 13.6 million in project termination fees for termination charges due to the notice of termination. In 2023, the Company determined that there was an impairment of an intangible asset contract, as such, recorded a charge of 50.7 million associated with a certain renewable energy asset of which, 7.0 million was associated with the plant and equipment asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the remainder of which was associated with the favorable PPA contract.

 Investment Management 
 Revenue 
 Revenue from the IM segment was 14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.2 million or 57 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in revenue within the period is primarily related to revenue earned from GREC II related to management and administrative fees as a result of the growth of assets under management at GREC II. Refer to Part I Item 1 , in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Direct operating costs IM 
 Direct operating costs from the IM segment was 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.2 million, or 2 , compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in Direct operating costs within the period is primarily related to lower allocated administrative and distribution related costs.

 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expense from the IM segment was 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0 million, or 149 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in General and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase in salary and compensation related expenses due to increased headcount for various functions providing support to the IM segment as well as additional share-based compensation expense related to GDEV II incentive fees. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 17. Share-based Compensation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information on GDEV II incentive fees. 
 
 Corporate 
 General and administrative expense for Corporate was 36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.8 million, or 15 , compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in General and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase in salary and compensation related expenses primarily due to increased headcount for corporate functions as well as professional fees associated with various non-recurring projects. Additionally, the Company recognized additional expense related to new restricted share units and performance restricted share units granted subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 17. Share-based Compensation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 
 Non-operating income and expense 
 Interest (expense) income, net 
 Interest (expense) income, net was 35.2 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.9 million of income for the same period for 2023. The change is primarily driven by interest expense related to our sale-leaseback transactions entered into subsequent to the nine months ended September 30, 2023,offset by an increase in the favorable changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 10. Debt and Note 11. Derivative Instruments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Change in fair value of investments, net 
 Change in fair value of investments, net was a gain of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 1.3 million in the same period for 2023. The change is primarily driven by the change in fair value of the Company s investments, primarily an increase in fair value for the Company s OYA and GDEV II investments, partially offset by a decrease in fair value for the Company s Aurora Solar investment. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 6. Fair Value Measurements and Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Benefit from income taxes 
 Benefit from income taxes was a benefit of 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.2 million for the same period for 2023. The change is primarily driven by a decrease in the Company s estimated effective tax rate to 2.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.9 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in estimated effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in the estimated tax impact from the Company s forecasted income attributable to GREC. This forecast changed to a smaller total net loss in 2024 compared to 2023 due to larger non recurring charges recorded in 2023. 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was 49.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 65.8 million for the same period for 2023. The decrease is primarily related to the difference in tax benefits allocated to the tax equity investors in 2023 related to certain tax equity partnerships offset by tax benefits allocated to tax equity investors in 2024 related to certain tax equity partnerships.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This Quarterly Report includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Funds from Operations FFO are useful to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance. Each of these measures should not be considered in isolation from or as superior to or as a substitute for other financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net income (loss) or operating income (loss). The Company uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, as well as evaluate its underlying historical performance and to measure incentive compensation, as we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures depict the true performance of the business by encompassing only relevant and controllable events, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. In addition, the Company s debt agreements contain covenants that use a variation of these measures for purposes of determining debt covenant compliance. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and FFO should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and FFO are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company s financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company s liquidity and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The presentations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and FFO should not be construed as an inference that the future results the Company will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. 
 The Company further utilizes non-GAAP financial measures to determine the NAV and MSV of our shares. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and FFO 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses as a performance measure as well as for internal planning purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in providing a measure of core financial performance adjusted to allow for comparisons of results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it includes adjustments relating to items that are not indicative on the ongoing operating performance of the business. 
 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before: (i) interest expense; (ii) income taxes; (iii) depreciation expense; (iv) amortization expense (including contract amortization); (v) accretion; (vi) impairment of long-lived assets; (vii) amounts attributable to our redeemable and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests; (viii) unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments; (ix) other income (loss); and (x) foreign currency gain (loss). Additionally, the Company further adjusts for the following items described below: 
 Share-based compensation is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA as it is different from other forms of compensation as it is a non-cash expense and is highly variable. For example, a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost. In contrast, the expense associated with an equity-based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee, and the cost to the Company is based on a share-based compensation valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time; 
 The change in fair value of contingent consideration, which is related to the Acquisition, is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, if any such change occurs during the period. The non-cash, mark-to-market adjustments are based on the expected achievement of revenue targets that are difficult to forecast and can be variable, making comparisons across historical and future quarters difficult to evaluate; and 
 Other costs that are not consistently occurring, not reflective of expected future operating expense and provide no insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. This includes costs such as professional services and legal fees, and other non-recurring costs unrelated to the ongoing operations of the Company. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure used by management that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as superior to or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 FFO 
 FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses as a performance measure to analyze net earnings from operations without the effects of certain non-recurring items that are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the business. 
 76 

Table of Contents 

 FFO is calculated using Adjusted EBITDA less the impact of interest expense (excluding the non-cash component) and distributions to Tax Equity Investors under the financing facilities associated with our IPP segment. The Company excludes these distributions as the underlying source of distribution (collection of a loan) is not recorded within Adjusted EBITDA and is therefore not a component of our earnings from operations. 
 The Company believes that the analysis and presentation of FFO will enhance our investor s understanding of the ongoing performance of our operating business. The Company considers FFO, in addition to other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, in assessing operating performance and as a proxy for growth in distribution coverage over the long-term. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and FFO should not be considered in isolation from or as a superior to or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Net Asset Value and Monthly Share Value 
 Net Asset Value 
 The Company calculates both NAV and MSV in accordance with valuation guidelines as approved by our Board of Directors. The Company accepts repurchases under the SRP in connection with the death, disability or determination of incompetence of a shareholder. In connection with suspending shareholder distributions, the Company suspended the DRP. Both the DRP and the SRP are based upon the current MSV per class in effect.

Table of Contents 

 The calculation of our NAV is intended to be a calculation of the fair value of our assets less our outstanding liabilities as described below and will differ from the book value of our equity reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as prepared under the Non-Investment Basis. Under the Non-Investment Basis, we are required to issue Consolidated Financial Statements based on historical cost in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To calculate our NAV for the purpose of establishing a purchase and repurchase price for our shares, we have adopted a model, as explained below, that adjusts the value of our assets and liabilities from historical cost to fair value generally in accordance with the U.S. GAAP principles set forth in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 ). 
 To calculate our NAV, the Company has established procedures to estimate fair value of its investments generally in accordance with ASC 820 that the Company s Board of Directors has reviewed and approved. To the extent that such market data is available, the Company uses observable market data to estimate the fair value of investments. In the absence of quoted market prices in active markets or quoted market prices for similar assets in markets that are not active, the Company uses the valuation methodologies described below with unobservable data based on the best available information in the circumstances. These methodologies incorporate the Company s assumptions about the factors that a market participant would use to value the asset. 
 For investments for which quoted market prices are not available, which comprise most of our investment portfolio, fair value is estimated by using the cost, income or market approach. The income approach assumes that value is created by the expectation of future benefits, discounted by a risk premium, to calculate a current cash value. This estimate is the fair value (the amount an investor would be willing to pay to receive those future benefits). The market approach compares either recent comparable transactions to the investment or an offer to purchase an investment based upon a qualified bid (a signed term sheet and/or a signed purchase agreement). Adjustments to proposed prices are made to account for the probability of the deal closing, changes between proposed and executed terms, and any dissimilarity between the comparable transactions and their underlying investments. If multiple bids are qualified in the same valuation period, a blended market approach will be calculated. 
 The Company considers all assets that are fully construction-ready with no impediments to begin construction and where the costs to complete such projects are well understood for the income approach. The fair value of such eligible projects is determined based upon a discounted cash flow methodology. If the portfolio has any significant portion of value that remains subject to negotiation or contract or if other significant risks to complete the project exist, the investment may be held at cost as an approximation of fair value. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment by management. 
 In determining the appropriate fair value of an investment using these approaches, the most significant information and assumptions include, as applicable: available current market data, including relevant and applicable comparable market transactions, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the investment s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the project does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, comparable mergers and acquisitions, the principal market and enterprise values and environmental factors, among other factors. 
 The Board of Directors has approved the selection of an independent valuation firm to review the Company s valuation methodology and to work with management to provide additional inputs for consideration by the Company s Board of Directors with respect to the fair value of investments. Currently, one quarter (25 of the Company s investments will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm each quarter on a rotating quarterly basis. Accordingly, each such investment is evaluated by an independent valuation firm at least once each twelve-month calendar period. 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 The determination of the fair value of the Company s investments requires judgment, especially with respect to investments for which market quotations are not available. For most of the Company s investments, market quotations are not available. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Because the calculation of Company s NAV is based, in part, on the fair value of Company s investments as determined by management, our calculation of NAV is to a degree subjective and could be adversely affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of the Company s investments were materially higher than the values that the Company ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments. The following table reconciles total equity per our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 to our NAV: 
 (in thousands, except per share data) 
 September 30, 2024 Total equity 1,642,354 Add back or deduct the following: Noncontrolling interests (225,781) Redeemable noncontrolling interests (1,828) Accumulated unrealized appreciation in fair value of investments 142,212 Net asset value (members equity) 1,556,957 Shares outstanding 199,420 NAV per share 7.81 
 The aggregate NAV of the Company s common shares as of September 30, 2024 was 1.6 billion, or 7.81 per share, and was determined in accordance with the valuation guidelines as approved by the Company s Board of Directors. Prior to the change in status, the Company recorded its renewable energy projects at fair value and recorded the changes in fair value as an unrealized gain or loss. Upon the change in status, this fair value accounting is no longer applicable, and the Company presents on a consolidated basis the underlying assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable U.S. GAAP. 
 The following details the adjustments to reconcile total equity as determined under U.S. GAAP to NAV: 
 Noncontrolling Interests 
 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and those of its subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial and/or voting interest. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 15. Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further discussion; and 
 The Company excludes NCI for purposes of determining NAV as to remove the portion of net assets that are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. This includes the allocation of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
 Accumulated Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) in Fair Value of Investments 
 Our renewable energy assets are presented at historical cost and all debt facilities are recorded at their carrying value in the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under U.S. GAAP. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of our renewable energy assets or our debt are not recorded in U.S. GAAP equity. For purposes of determining NAV, our renewable energy projects and project-level debt are recorded at fair value. As a result, we include the accumulated unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in fair value of our renewable energy projects and project-level debt in NAV. The inception-to-date accumulated unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in fair value of our renewable energy projects as determined under the Investment Basis was included in U.S. GAAP equity as of May 19, 2022 (refer to the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of change in presentation due to change in status). As such, the adjustments reflect the change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in fair value of our renewable energy projects and project-level debt from May 19, 2022 and prospectively; and

Table of Contents 

 The fair value of the Company s derivative instruments, which represent interest rate swap contracts, and the related unrealized gain (loss) are already recorded within U.S. GAAP equity. As such, the unrealized gain (loss) associated with the fair value of the Company s renewable energy projects does not include the impact of our hedging activities associated with interest rate volatility on project-level debt. The following table provides for a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of September 30, 2024:

 Monthly Share Value 
 In addition to the description above to determine our non-GAAP NAV, we have adopted a model, as explained below, that adjusts NAV to MSV. The Company offers shares pursuant to the DRP and accepts repurchases under the SRP in connection with the death, disability or determination of incompetence of a shareholder. Both the DRP and the SRP are based upon the current MSV per class in effect. 
 We calculate our MSV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines that have been approved by our Board of Directors. As a general rule we will continue to monitor the valuation of the Company s entire investment portfolio and make adjustments to the NAV and MSV as necessary as soon as is practical thereafter to reflect any changes in market conditions that materially impact the value of our shares. On the last business day of every month, the Company will consider the appropriateness of the MSV . As part of that consideration, it will consider the current market values of our liquid and illiquid investment portfolios. 
 MSV is the basis for: (1) determining the price offered for each class of our shares pursuant to the DRP and the price per share that is paid to shareholder participants in our SRP; and (2) the value of an investment in our shares, as shown on each shareholder s periodic customer account statement. While we believe our MSV calculation methodologies are consistent with standard industry practices, there is no rule or regulation that requires we calculate MSV in a certain way. MSV should not be considered equivalent to stockholders equity or any other U.S. GAAP measure. 
 The Company s quarterly process to determine MSV per share class is performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The MSV per share class as of September 30, 2024 was approved by the Company s Board of Directors.

 Our MSV per share does not represent the amount of our assets less our liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not represent, warrant or guarantee that: 
 A shareholder would be able to realize the MSV per share for the class of shares a shareholder owns if the shareholder attempts to sell its shares; 
 A shareholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the MSV per share for the class of shares it owns upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or upon a sale of our Company; 
 Shares of our limited liability company interests would trade at their MSV per share on a national securities exchange; 
 A third-party would offer the MSV per share for each class of shares in an arm s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of our shares; or 
 The MSV per share would equate to a market price of an open-ended renewable energy fund. 
 The following details the adjustments to reconcile members equity as determined under U.S. GAAP to our MSV: 
 The accrued shareholder servicing fee represents the accrual for the full cost of the shareholder servicing fee for Class P-S, Class P-T and Class C shares. Under U.S. GAAP and NAV, we accrued the full cost of the shareholder servicing fee payable over the life of each share (assuming such share remains outstanding the length of time required to pay the maximum shareholder servicing fee) as an offering cost at the time we sold the Class P-S, Class P-T and Class C shares. For purposes of our MSV, we recognize the shareholder servicing fee as a reduction of MSV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid; and 
 Under GAAP and NAV, organization costs are expensed as incurred and offering costs are charged to equity as such amounts are incurred. For MSV, such costs will be recognized as a reduction to MSV as they are charged to equity ratably over 60 months.

 Electricity Production by Our Fleet 
 Our strategy of purchasing distributed generation and opportunistic utility scale projects enables us to continue building a highly diversified portfolio. While buying and operating middle-market projects poses certain challenges compared with buying large single projects, we see significant benefits associated with these middle-market projects in terms of investment return potential due to less competition with large capital providers, opportunity to buy pipelines of deals from developers, and the overall scalability of the asset class, where solar and wind projects can be purchased to match capital inflows. 
 The power-production capacity of the Company s operating fleet of renewable energy projects increased by 0.1 GW on a year-over-year basis as the Company acquired new operating projects and its under-construction projects entered commercial operation. 
 As illustrated below, this capacity growth enabled the Company s fleet of clean energy projects to produce over 0.8 million megawatt hours MWh of total power during the three months ended September 30, 2024, marking a year-over-year increase of 18 . The increased production is driven by the solar energy segment, which included 0.6 million MWh of solar energy production, representing year-over-year growth of 15 .

 The Company s operating solar fleet includes 336 operating assets comprising 1,208 MW of capacity as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 22 operating assets and 111 megawatts MW capacity compared to the prior year period. Total production was 0.6 million MWh for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 million MWh compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to additional assets being placed in operation during and subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s operating wind fleet includes 16 operating assets comprising 393 MW of capacity as of September 30, 2024, an increase of seven MW capacity compared to the prior year period. In addition, total production was 0.2 million MWh for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 million MWh compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to increased production from the Company s restarted wind repower projects from 2023, a large wind asset that was under repair in 2023 and higher than expected wind resources for generation. 
 Partially offsetting the overall increase of production, the Company s biomass production decreased 17.3 thousand MWh for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the deconsolidation of EVCE in April 2024. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our current renewable project assets, acquire, construct and develop our future renewable energy projects, make investments in renewable energy businesses, repurchase our common shares pursuant to the SRP, and other general business needs. 
 The Company s short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt, to make distributions to our shareholders (to the extent authorized and declared by the Board of Directors) and to repurchase our common shares pursuant to our SRP in connection with the death, disability or determination of incompetence of a shareholder. We also have a significant pipeline of currently contracted and potential future development, construction and acquisition projects, all of which will require short-term funding. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and borrowings under our existing financing sources and future debt and equity financing. 
 The Company s long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and other financing obligations, and to acquire, construct and develop renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with operating cash flow, cash on hand, borrowings under our existing financing sources and future debt and equity financing.

Table of Contents 

 The Company s primary sources of financing include corporate-level credit facilities or other secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. In addition, we expect to use other financing methods at the project level as necessary, including joint venture structures, construction loans, tax equity bridge loans, property mortgages, letters of credit, sale and leaseback transactions, other lease transactions and other arrangements, any of which may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets. In addition, other sources of capital may include tax equity financings, sale of tax credits, governmental grant proceeds, and proceeds from sales of assets and capital repayments from investments. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Tax Equity Investors, passive investors which could be financial institutions, insurance companies or corporations, contribute capital based on construction milestones in exchange for a share of the tax credits (and other tax benefits such as accelerated depreciation) and cash flows generated by a qualifying physical investment. Initially, the tax equity investor receives substantially all of the non-cash value attributable to the renewable energy systems and energy storage systems, which includes accelerated depreciation and Section 48(a) ITCs or Section 45(a) PTC; and generally between 15 -30 of the cash generated by the asset. These allocations then flip once certain time or yield-based milestones are met. Time-based flips occur on a set date after a five-year recapture period while yield-based flips occur after the tax equity investor achieves a specified return typically on an after-tax basis which may last longer than expected if the portfolio company s energy projects perform below our expectations. After the flip occurs, we receive substantially all of the cash and tax allocations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 108.4 million and 96.9 million, respectively, in Cash and cash equivalents and 61.1 million and 85.2 million, respectively, in Restricted cash, current. In the short-term, we anticipate continuing to (1) increase our draw on current financing facilities, and (2) enter into new financing arrangements. 
 We remain focused on maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility and continue to monitor the capital and credit markets. Beyond the primary sources of liquidity we use to meet our cash requirements, we continue to explore a variety of financing options to supplement our current cash flows in order to allow us to maintain normal future operations and to take advantage of the investment opportunities available in the marketplace. These financing options include, among others, raising capital in the public or private capital markets (which may include from existing investors) and establishing new financing arrangements with commercial banks. However, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the cost we would incur in connection with such financing or whether we will be able to consummate any such financing. 
 The Company continues to regularly monitor the Company s ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investment activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management. The pace as to which we are able to progress our significant pipeline of currently contracted and potential future development, construction and project acquisition projects is expected to be impacted by our ability to access additional financing. The more success we achieve in our capital raising and other financing activities, the faster we will be able to place in service new projects and begin to receive operating cash flow from these projects. If the amount of capital that is available to us on favorable terms is less than what is needed to fully fund these pipeline activities, we may be forced to slow the pace of these activities, which may ultimately delay or eliminate future operating cash flow that we anticipate will be available to us. 
 The Company suspended the payment of shareholder distributions effective following the distribution payment on May 1, 2024. In connection with suspending shareholder distributions, the Company also suspended the DRP which was offered to shareholders who could elect to have the full amount of cash distributions reinvested in additional shares. We also suspended our SRP effective September 23, 2023 (except with respect to repurchase requests made in connection with the death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence of a shareholder), and as a result, we expect to be able to devote a greater amount of our liquidity and capital resources to executing our broader business strategy. The Company is also currently engaged in a thorough assessment of the GREC fleet, with a view to potentially divest certain of the Company s current investments where, as an active portfolio manager, the Company can unlock capital either for reinvestment or to return to our shareholders. 
 If we are unable to expand our sources of financing, fully utilize our available cash or otherwise meet the required terms and financial covenants associated with our financing arrangements, it may have an adverse effect on our ability to reinstate distributions to our shareholders and to fund and continue our operations. Our liquidity plans are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described under the section titled Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Debt Outstanding 
 We supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns through the use of prudent levels of borrowings both at the corporate level and the project level. The Fifth Operating Agreement does not impose limitations on the amount of borrowings we may employ either at the corporate level or the project level. Our current policy is to generally target a leverage ratio of up to 2 of debt for every 1 of equity on our overall portfolio, with individual allocations of leverage based on the mix of asset types and obligors.

Table of Contents 

 The weighted average interest rate including associated swap agreements, deferred financing costs and capitalized interest on total debt outstanding was 3.90 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.1 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, in outstanding debt. See Part I Item 1 Note 10. Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 In the future, we expect that our ongoing sources of financing will be through corporate-level credit facilities or other secured and unsecured borrowings. In addition, we expect to use other financing methods at the project level as necessary, including joint venture structures, construction loans, tax equity bridge loans, property mortgages, letters of credit, sale and leaseback transactions, other lease transactions and other arrangements, any of which may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets. Other sources of capital may include tax equity financings, whereby an investor receives an allocation of tax benefits as well as cash distribution. 
 As of and for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, GREC Entity HoldCo was not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) for the credit agreement related to GREC Entity HoldCo, which resulted in the Company s classification of the debt to current liability as of December 31, 2023. The Company secured a waiver of default on June 12, 2024. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 10. Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for additional information. 
 
 Changes in Cash Flows 
 The following table shows cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the Company for the periods indicated: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 56,340 34,122 Net cash used in investing activities (193,996) (262,436) Net cash provided by financing activities 122,607 114,851 Net decrease in Cash, cash equivalents and Restricted cash (15,049) (113,463) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 22.2 million, compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the non-cash adjustments such as equity compensation expense of 13.0 million depreciation and amortization expense of 71.1 million, impairment of long-lived asset, net of 19.1 million and project termination cost of 13.6 million. Additionally, the increase was due to a decrease in net loss of 14.8 million compared to the prior year period and an increase in working capital of 43.2 million, primarily driven by the receipt of 47.2 million due to the termination of an interest rate swap in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 194.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in cash used of 68.4 million, compared to the same period for 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to an increase in receipts from notes receivable of 33.8 million as well as a reduction in payments made for ongoing construction projects of 29.5 million related to our solar and wind fleet as pre-operating projects reached COD and a decrease in pre-operating projects acquired subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the decrease in net cash used in investing activities is due to 12.5 million of additional net deposits returned for property, plant and equipment primarily due to reimbursements of refundable deposits on certain of our property, plant and equipment, return of capital of 6.6 million from the Company s OYA investment and a decrease in purchases related to the Company s equity method investments of 3.8 million. This was offset by additional loans made to Cider and OYA of 17.7 million.

 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 122.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.8 million, compared to the same period for 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily driven by cash proceeds of 111.5 million related to the sale-leaseback transaction entered during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in cash paid for repurchases of common shares and shareholder distributions and repurchases of 48.3 million and 27.9 million due to the suspension of the Company s SRP and DRP, respectively. Additionally, the increase in net cash provided by financing activities is driven by additional contributions from noncontrolling interests of 13.8 million and additional proceeds on borrowings of 13.3 million, compared to the prior year period. This was partially offset by an increase in cash paid on borrowings of 114.2 million, and additional payments on the Company s sale-leaseback transactions of 87.3 million, compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company has a variety of contractual obligations and commitments, both short-term and long-term in nature. We have included the following information related to commitments of the Company to further assist investors in understanding our outstanding commitments. 
 Debt Outstanding 
 The Company has various borrowings both at the corporate level and the project level. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.1 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, in outstanding debt. The Company currently has 89.7 million of capacity available to draw on its existing debt facilities. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 10. Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
 Letters of Credit 
 The Company is required to provide security under the terms of several of its power purchase agreements, permits, lease agreements and other project documents as well as many of its loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has provided the requisite security for these agreements in the form of a standby letter of credit of 176.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no unused letter of credit capacity. 
 Pledge of Collateral and Unsecured Guarantee of Loans to Subsidiaries 
 Pursuant to various project loan agreements between the Company's subsidiaries and various lenders, the Company has pledged solar and wind operating assets as well as the membership interests in various subsidiaries as collateral for the term loans with maturity dates ranging from December 2024 through March 2030. 
 Investment in To-Be-Constructed Assets and Membership Interest Purchase Commitments 
 Pursuant to various engineering, procurement and construction contracts and membership interest purchase agreements to which certain of the Company's subsidiaries are individually a party, the subsidiaries, and indirectly the Company, have committed an amount of approximately 0.8 billion to complete construction of the facilities and the closing of the purchase of membership interest pursuant to all conditions being met under such agreements. Based upon current construction and closing schedules, the expectation is that these commitments will be fulfilled between 2024 and 2028. The Company plans to use debt and tax equity financing as well as cash on hand to fund such commitments. 
 Power Purchase Agreements 
 The Company has long-term PPAs with its offtake customers. Under the PPAs, the Company is required to deliver agreed-upon quantities based on the agreements for successive periods, typically between one to five year rolling periods, over the terms of the PPAs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all agreed-upon delivery quantities. 
 Renewable Energy Credits Commitments 
 For certain solar and wind power systems, the Company has received incentives in the form of RECs. In certain cases, the entities have entered into fixed-price, fixed-volume forward sale transactions to monetize these RECs for specific entities. If we are unable to satisfy the transaction requirements due to lack of production, we may have to purchase RECs on the spot market and/or pay specified replacement cost damages. Based upon current production projections, we do not expect a requirement to purchase RECs to fulfill our current REC sales contracts. When RECs earned by the entities are sold either on a forward basis or in the spot market, revenue is recorded when the REC is transferred. 
 87 

Table of Contents 

 Recording of a sale of RECs under U.S. GAAP is accounted for under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). There are no differences in the process and related revenue recognition between REC sales to utilities and non-utility customers. Revenue is recorded when all revenue recognition criteria are met, including that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists (typically through a contract), services are rendered through the production of electricity, pricing is fixed and determinable under the contract, and collectability is reasonably assured. The accounting policy adopted is that the revenue recognition criteria are met when the energy is produced, and a REC is created and transferred to a third party when sold on a forward basis or in the spot market. 
 If any of our REC counterparties fail to satisfy their contractual obligations, our revenues may decrease under replacement agreements, and we may incur expenses locating and executing such replacement agreements. For the majority of the forward REC contracts currently effective as of September 30, 2024, GREC and/or the Company has provided an unsecured guaranty related to the delivery obligations under these contracts. The amount of the unsecured guaranty on REC contracts is nil as of September 30, 2024. 
 Pledge of Parent Company Guarantee s 
 Pursuant to various tax equity structures, which are governed by various agreements to which certain of the Company s subsidiaries are individually a party to, the Company has provided unsecured guarantees to support the commitments and obligations of these underlying tax equity agreements in an amount of 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not aware of any events that could trigger the Company s obligations under these guarantees. 
 In addition, the Company, along with the parent company of the other 50.00 member of OYA, provided a guarantee to the tax equity investor member in one of the partnerships, for which OYA is the partner, for the payment and performance of all obligations of these subsidiaries under the partnership documents as well as affiliate contracts. As of September 30, 2024, the Company considers it remote that it would be required to make payments under any of these guarantees. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 5. Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further details. 
 Leases 
 Lease agreements are evaluated at inception to determine whether they represent finance or operating leases. The Company has determined that the majority of its leases represent operating leases, and accordingly, minimum rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the lease commencement date. For finance leases, the minimum rental expense is recognized in a front-loaded expense pattern. Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further details on the Company s lease obligations. 
 
 Distributions 
 Subject to the Board of Directors review and approval and applicable legal restrictions, we intend to authorize and declare distributions on a quarterly basis and pay distributions on a monthly basis. When authorized and declared, we calculate each shareholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates, and each member s distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept each member s subscription for shares. From time to time, we may also pay interim special distributions in the form of cash or shares, with the approval of our Board of Directors. 
 Distributions will be made on all classes of our shares at the same time. The cash distributions with respect to the Class C, P-S and P-T shares are lower than the cash distributions with respect to Class A, I, P-A, P-I and P-D shares because of the distribution fee relating to Class C, P-S and P-T shares, which will be allocated as a class-specific charge. Amounts distributed to each class will be allocated among the holders of our shares in such class in proportion to their shares. 
 Cash distributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were funded from cash on hand and other external financing sources. To the extent authorized and declared by the Board of Directors, the Company expects to continue to fund distributions from a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations as well as other external financing sources. Due to the Company s acquisition strategy to own pre-operational assets that are not yet generating cash from operations as well as the Company s strategy of engaging in initiatives that include repowering projects where the existing assets are being retrofit with new and/or refurbished technology, including erecting taller, more efficient wind turbines to increase productivity, a significant amount of distributions will continue to be funded from other external financing sources until such projects become operational. Management fee and incentive fee revenue from our IM segment is also utilized as a source of capital to fund distributions as this portion of our business grows. 
 The Company suspended the payment of shareholder distributions effective following the distribution payment on May 1, 2024. In connection with suspending shareholder distributions, the Company also suspended the DRP which was offered to shareholders who could elect to have the full amount of cash distributions reinvested in additional shares.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 The Company, through approval by its Board of Directors, adopted the SRP, pursuant to which the Company would conduct quarterly share repurchases to allow members to sell all or a portion of their shares (of any class) back to the Company at a price equal to the then current monthly share value for that class of shares. 
 The SRP includes numerous restrictions that will limit a shareholder s ability to sell shares. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company may also use cash on hand (including the proceeds from the issuance of new shares), cash available from borrowings or other external financing sources and cash from liquidation of investments to repurchase shares. 
 A shareholders right to purchase is subject to the availability of funds and the other provisions of the SRP. Additionally, a shareholder must hold his or her shares for a minimum of one year before he or she can participate in the SRP, subject to any of the following special circumstances: (i) the written request of the estate, heir or beneficiary or a deceased shareholder; (ii) a qualifying disability of the shareholder for a non-temporary period of time, provided that the condition causing the qualifying disability was not pre-existing on the date that the shareholder became a shareholder; (iii) a determination of incompetence of the shareholder by a state or federal court located in the United States; or (iv) as determined by the Board of Directors, in their discretion, to be in the interests of the Company. If a member has made more than one purchase of shares, the one-year holding period will be calculated separately with respect to each purchase. 
 The quarterly share repurchases limits for the SRP are set forth below. 
 Quarter Ending Share Repurchase Limit(s) September 30, 2021, and each quarter thereafter During any 12-month period, 20.00 of the weighted average number of outstanding shares 
 During any fiscal quarter, 5.00 of the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the prior four fiscal quarters 
 
 The Company may repurchase fewer shares than have been requested in any particular quarter to be repurchased under the SRP, or none at all, in its discretion at any time. Further, the Board of Directors may modify, suspend or terminate the SRP if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders or in response to regulatory changes or changes in law. 
 On September 23, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the suspension of the SRP effective immediately, except for repurchase requests made in connection with the death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence of a shareholder. As a result of the suspension of the SRP, the Company will not accept or otherwise process any additional repurchase requests (except as noted above) until such time, if any, as the Board of Directors affirmatively authorizes the recommencement of the SRP. However, the Company can make no assurances as to whether this will happen or the timing or terms of any recommencement. 
 The Company has received an order for the SRP from the SEC under Rule 102(a) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. In addition, the SRP is substantially similar to repurchase programs for which the SEC has stated it will not recommend enforcement action under Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company engages in financial transactions that are not presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or may be recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unfunded commitments and guarantees to the Tax Equity Investors, which may affect our liquidity and funding requirements based on the likelihood that borrowers will advance funds under the loan commitments, or we will be required to perform under the guarantee obligations.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The following qualitative disclosures regarding our market risk exposures, except for: (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact, and (ii) the descriptions of how we manage our primary market risk exposures, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Our primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by us managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of our risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to our risk exposures and risk management strategies. There can be no assurance that our current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short or long term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all their investment in the shares. 
 We anticipate that our primary market risks will be related to commodity prices, the credit quality of our counterparties and project companies, changes in market interest rates and changes in government incentives. We will seek to manage these risks while at the same time seeking to provide an opportunity for shareholders to realize attractive returns through ownership of our shares. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Acquisitions of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects and businesses expose us to volatility in the market prices of electricity. To stabilize our revenue, we generally expect our projects will have PPAs with local utilities and offtakers that ensure all or most of electricity generated by each project will be purchased at the contracted price. In the event any electricity is not purchased by the offtaker or the energy produced exceeds the offtaker s capacity, we generally will sell that excess energy to the local utility or another suitable counterparty, which would ensure revenue is generated for all electricity produced. We may be exposed to the risk that the offtaker will fail to perform under the PPA, with the result that we will have to sell our electricity at the market price, which could be either advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on the market price of electricity at that point in time. 
 In regard to the market price of oil, our investments are little affected by the volatility in this market, as most oil consumed in the U.S. today is used for transportation infrastructure and not for the generation of electricity. Volatility in the market price of natural gas can result in volatility in the market price of electricity. The contractual status of our projects limits our exposure to volatility in the market prices of electricity caused by volatility in the market price of natural gas to our projects post-PPA periods, to situations where an offtaker is unable to fulfill their contractual obligation to buy the power the projects generate, or to situations where the projects generate energy in excess of that agreed upon in their PPAs and the excess power is sold to the market. 
 In regard to the market price of other commodities, increases in the costs of raw materials used in the construction of our renewable energy assets, could materially adversely affect the cost required to bring our projects to commercial operation. To mitigate this risk, we (i) when possible, share this risk with developers from whom we purchase in construction and pre-construction assets, and (ii) pursue large forward procurement strategies to secure equipment for our in-construction portfolio from large and credit worthy suppliers of equipment with fixed price contracts. When we do assume pricing risk for equipment, we budget for what we believe are conservative contingencies within our construction budgets. 
 Credit Risk 
 Through our acquisitions in our target assets, we expect to be indirectly exposed to credit risk relating to counterparties to the electricity sales agreements (including PPAs) for our projects as well as the businesses in which we invest. If counterparties to the electricity sales agreements for our projects or the businesses in which we invest are unable to make payments to us when due, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The Company will seek to mitigate this risk by deploying a comprehensive review and asset selection process and careful ongoing monitoring of acquired assets. In addition, we will seek contracts with high-credit-quality counterparties. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates 
 With respect to our business operations, general increases in interest rates over time may cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase, and the value of our debt investments to decline. Conversely, general decreases in interest rates over time may cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease, and the value of our secured loans to increase. We attempt to use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed interest rate payments. 
 91 

Table of Contents 

 The Company documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions, at the inception of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, or a treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized into earnings over the same periods during which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. 
 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings), net of tax, and are subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by utilizing a third-party statistical regression analysis. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to designated derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate liabilities. 
 Refer to Part I Item 1 Note 11. Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further information with respect to the Company's derivative instruments. 
 If all of the interest rate swaps had been discontinued on September 30, 2024, the counterparties would have owed the Company 81.7 million. Based on the credit ratings of the counterparties, the Company believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. 
 Changes in Government Incentives 
 Retrospective changes in the levels of government incentives may have a negative impact on our current renewable energy projects. Prospective changes in the levels of government incentives, including renewable energy credits and investment tax credits, may impact the relative attractiveness of future acquisitions in various renewable energy projects, which could make it difficult for the Company to find suitable acquisitions in the sector. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, and determined that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed and summarized and reported within the time period specified in the applicable rules and forms. 
 Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable (but not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be met. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
