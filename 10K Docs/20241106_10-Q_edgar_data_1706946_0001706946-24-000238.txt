 Basic and diluted net loss per share 
 Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net loss per share excludes the effect of all potential common shares outstanding as their impact would have been anti-dilutive. 
 The Company has excluded stock-based awards and shares issuable upon conversion of the 2027 Notes from the diluted loss per share calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive. The total number of shares excluded for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million.

 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company applies accounting for contingencies to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies. Accordingly, the Company discloses contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrues loss contingencies when, in consultation with legal advisors, it is concluded that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters is subject to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance, management believes that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, beyond that provided at September 30, 2024, would not be material to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance with respect to such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims could differ materially from those projected. 
 The Boeing Company and Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation v. the Company 
 On March 21, 2024, The Boeing Company and Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, a Boeing Company (collectively, Boeing ), filed suit against the Company in the Eastern District of Virginia, captioned The Boeing Company and Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, a Boeing Company v.

The complaint seeks damages in excess of million, expenses, attorneys fees and other equitable relief. On April 12, 2024, the Company filed an answer to Boeing s complaint and a counterclaim seeking damages relating to Boeing s breach of the Master Agreement, as well as an opposition to Boeing s motion for a preliminary injunction. 
 On April 4, 2024, the Company filed suit against Boeing in the Central District of California.

As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the Risk Factors sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and under the "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We are an aerospace and space travel company offering access to space for private individuals, researchers and government agencies. Our missions include flying passengers to space, as well as flying scientific payloads and researchers to space in order to conduct experiments for scientific and educational purposes. Our operations include the design and development, manufacturing, ground and flight testing, spaceflight operation, and post-flight maintenance of our spaceflight system. Our spaceflight system was developed using our proprietary technology and processes and is focused on providing space experiences for private astronauts, researcher flights and professional astronaut training. We have also leveraged our knowledge and expertise in manufacturing spaceships to occasionally perform engineering services for third parties. 
 Recent Developments 
 In June 2024, we completed our second spaceflight of 2024 and seventh commercial spaceflight to date, 'Galactic 07,' carrying one researcher and three private astronauts. Following the ' Galactic 07' flight , we paused Unity spaceflights and expect to re-commence flying with test flights of our new Delta Class spaceships in advance of restarting commercial service, which is expected to begin in 2026. 
 On June 12, 2024, at the Company s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved, and on June 14, 2024, we effected, a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ), and our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 17, 2024. Prior to the Reverse Stock Split, on May 29, 2024, we received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE that we were no longer in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 802.01C ), which requires listed companies to maintain an average closing price per share of at least 1.00 over a 30 consecutive trading-day period. Following the Reverse Stock Split, on July 1, 2024, we received a letter from the NYSE stating that we regained compliance with Section 802.01C. 
 All shares of our common stock, per-share data and related information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retroactively adjusted as though the Reverse Stock Split had been effected prior to all periods presented. 
 In July 2024, we completed our new manufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona, where final assembly of our next-generation Delta Class spaceships is scheduled to begin in 2025. After the initial development of our first Delta Class spaceship, we estimate the recurring cost to make each additional spaceship to be between 50 and 60 million. 
 In October 2024, we settled the lawsuit and all claims between us and The Boeing Company and Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, a Boeing Company. See Note 13 in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below, as well as in Part 1, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors and in Part II, Item 1A. in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

 Customer Demand 
 We have already received significant interest from potential astronauts. Going forward, we expect the size of our backlog and the number of astronauts that have flown to space on our spaceflight system to be an important indicator of our future performance. As of September 30, 2024, we have reservations for spaceflights for approximately 700 future astronauts, which represent approximately 194 million in expected future spaceflight revenue upon completion of the spaceflights. 
 Available Capacity and Annual Flight Rate 
 We commenced our commercial operations with VSS Unity and VMS Eve, which together comprised our initial commercial spaceflight system. Our annual flight rate is constrained by the availability and capacity of this commercial spaceflight system. To expand capacity, we are currently developing our next-generation spaceflight vehicles. These next-generation spaceflight vehicles, which include our Delta Class spaceships and additional motherships, are expected to dramatically increase our annual flight rate. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we completed a number of significant milestones related to the design phase of our Delta Class spaceships, including the completion of a majority of the manufacturing designs. These achievements will enable us to deploy some of our engineers from the Delta program to the design of our new mothership. We anticipate these additional engineering and design resources, together with the infusion of additional growth capital, could enable us to deploy our new mothership for commercial service in 2028. 
 Safety Performance of Our Spaceflight Systems 
 Our spaceflight systems are highly specialized with sophisticated and complex technology. We have built operational processes to ensure that the design, manufacture, performance and servicing of our spaceflight systems meet rigorous quality standards. However, our spaceflight systems are still subject to operational and process risks, such as manufacturing and design issues, human errors, or cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived safety issues may result in significant reputational harm to our business and our ability to generate spaceflight revenue.

 Spaceline operations expense includes costs to maintain and operate our spaceflight system; non-capitalizable costs to build our new vehicles and manufacture items required to support the making of our vehicles, such as rocket motors and spare parts; the consumption of rocket motors, fuel and other consumables; costs to maintain and support our Future Astronaut community; and costs to provide payload cargo and engineering services. 
 Following the launch of commercial service and achievement of technological feasibility in July 2023, we began presenting the operating expenses supporting our commercial spaceline activities as spaceline operations expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Prior to achievement of technological feasibility, spaceline operations expense included costs to support our Future Astronaut community and costs related to payload cargo and engineering services, which were previously presented as customer experience expense. 
 
 Spaceline operations expense decreased from 25.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 19.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a 5.4 million decrease in cash compensation and other employee benefit costs primarily due to a reduction in headcount and labor allocated to capitalizable projects. 
 Spaceline operations expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, following achievement of technological feasibility in July 2023, were primarily attributable to costs to maintain and operate our spaceflight system; non-capitalizable costs to build our new vehicles and manufacture items required to support the making of our vehicles; and costs to maintain and support our Future Astronaut community.

 Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to support activities that advance our future fleet towards commercialization, including basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related testing activities. Research and development costs will consist primarily of equipment, material, and labor costs (including from third-party contractors) for designing the spaceflight system s structure, spaceflight propulsion system, and flight profiles for our next-generation spaceships and motherships, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. 
 Research and development expenses decreased from 44.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by the settlement of certain disputed vendor invoices, resulting in a reversal of 18.6 million of accrued costs, a 6.2 million decrease in cash compensation and other employee benefit costs primarily due to a reduction in headcount and the completion of the modifications of VSS Unity and VMS Eve in July 2023, and a 2.1 million decrease in materials, consulting, and other costs primarily due to the completion of the VSS Unity and VMS Eve modifications. These decreases were partially offset by an 8.1 million increase in sub-contractor and contract labor costs associated with the development of our next-generation spaceflight vehicles.

Interest expense increased from 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We have accumulated net operating losses at the U.S. federal and state levels. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. The income tax expense is primarily related to corporate income taxes for our operations in the United Kingdom, which operates on a cost-plus arrangement. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 204.7 million and marketable securities of 539.2 million. Our principal sources of liquidity have come from sales of our common stock and offering of convertible senior notes ("2027 Notes").

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 271.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of 270.3 million of net losses, adjusted for non-cash items, which included stock-based compensation expense of 24.0 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 11.3 million, partially offset by 11.7 million of other non-cash items and 25.0 million of cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 352.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of 398.4 million of net losses, adjusted for non-cash items, which primarily included stock-based compensation expense of 35.6 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 9.7 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 116.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of 729.4 million in proceeds from maturities and calls of marketable securities, partially offset by 527.4 million in purchases of marketable securities and 86.1 million in capital expenditures. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 196.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted of 873.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and 25.9 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by 702.3 million in proceeds from maturities and calls of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 106.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of net cash proceeds from the sale and issuance of common stock of 107.7 million, partially offset by tax withholdings paid for net settled stock-based awards of 1.2 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 475.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of net cash proceeds from the sale and issuance of common stock of 479.0 million, partially offset by tax withholdings paid for net settled stock-based awards of 3.0 million. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenditures to fluctuate in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance the development of our next-generation spaceflight system and leverage investments in capital expenditures. 
 As our fleet of spaceships expands, we expect our expenditures to increase as we scale our commercial operations. Specifically, our long-term expenditures will increase as we: 
 scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support expanding our fleet with additional spaceships, carrier aircraft and rocket motors in connection with commercialization; 
 hire additional personnel in manufacturing operations, testing programs, maintenance operations and guest services as we increase the volume of our spaceflights; 
 scale up required operational facilities, such as hangars and warehouses; and 
 establish our astronaut campus in New Mexico. 
 We expect our arrangements with third-party providers to manufacture key subassemblies for our next-generation spaceships and for the design and manufacture of our next-generation carrier aircraft will require significant capital expenditures. Certain estimated amounts in connection with third-party arrangements are subject to future negotiations and cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty. 
 We believe that our current capital is adequate to sustain our operations for at least the next twelve months. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. While we have completed our initial commercial launch with a single spaceship, we are currently developing our next-generation spaceflight vehicles. We anticipate the costs to manufacture additional vehicles will begin to decrease as we continue to scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities.

 Issuances of Common Stock 
 In August 2022, we entered into a distribution agency agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC (each, an Agent and collectively, the Agents providing for the offer and sale of up to 300 million of shares of our common stock from time to time through the Agents, acting as sales agents, or directly to one or more of the Agents, acting as principal(s), through an "at-the-market offering" program (the "2022 ATM Program"). 
 We completed the 2022 ATM Program in June 2023, selling a total of 3.0 million shares of common stock and generating 300 million in gross proceeds, before deducting 3.0 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses. 
 In June 2023, we entered into a distribution agency agreement with the Agents providing for the offer and sale of up to 400 million of shares of our common stock from time to time through the Agents, acting as sales agents, or directly to one or more of the Agents, acting as principal(s), through an "at-the-market offering" program (the "2023 ATM Program"). 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 8.8 million shares of common stock under the 2023 ATM Program and generated 108.7 million in gross proceeds, before deducting 1.0 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 12.8 million shares of common stock under the 2023 ATM Program, generating 396.2 million in gross proceeds, before deducting 3.9 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses. 
 Liquidity Outlook 
 For at least the next twelve months, we expect our principal demand for funds will be for our ongoing activities described above. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity available to fund our business needs, commitments and contractual obligations for the next twelve months. 
 Beyond the next twelve months, our principal demand for funds will be to sustain our operations, operate our spaceline at Spaceport America in New Mexico, and expand our fleet of spaceships, motherships, and supporting facilities. We expect to generate revenue from our spaceflight program, which is expected to restart in 2026. To the extent this source of capital as well as sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing. 
 The commercial launch of our spaceflight program and the anticipated expansion of our fleet have unpredictable costs and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, that may affect the timing and magnitude of these anticipated expenditures. Some of these risk and uncertainties are described in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business . 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Except as set forth in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations and commitments as described in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies referred to below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and, therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Accordingly, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates compared to those previously disclosed in "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" included in Part II, Item 7.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
