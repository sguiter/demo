 Services and Other 
 
 The Company earns revenue as part of services performed via the +Oscar platform. Services revenue is recognized in the period the contractual performance obligations are satisfied and measured in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for performing the services. The timing of the Company's revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by customers. A receivable is recorded to Premiums and accounts receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and there is an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, deferred revenue is recorded to Accounts payable and other liabilities when payment is received before the performance obligations are satisfied. Other revenue includes primarily sublease income.

 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes in a private placement to funds affiliated with or advised by Dragoneer Investment Group, LLC, Thrive Capital, LionTree Investment Management, LLC and Tenere Capital LLC. The 2031 Notes are the Company's senior, unsecured obligations which bear interest at a rate of per annum, payable in cash, semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on June 30, 2022.

 The 2031 Notes are convertible into the Company's Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of 120.1721 per 1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of Class A common stock), subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, a conditional conversion feature of the 2031 Notes was satisfied when the last reported sales price per share of the Company s common stock was greater than of the conversion price of per share for each of at least twenty ) trading days during the period of thirty ) consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the quarter. As a result, the 2031 Notes are convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024 at the option of the holder.

In the case of federal and state-run reinsurance programs, no reinsurance premiums are paid. Expected reimbursement from the reinsurer for claims incurred are recorded as a reduction to claims incurred with a corresponding reinsurance recoverable asset.

 Credit Ratings 
 
 The financial condition of the Company's reinsurers is regularly evaluated to minimize exposure to significant losses. A key credit quality indicator for reinsurance is the financial strength ratings issued by the credit rating agencies, which provide an independent opinion of a reinsurer s ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. The Company s reinsurers have most recently been issued financial strength ratings of A+ or higher. 
 
 The creditworthiness of each reinsurer is evaluated in order to assess counterparty credit risk and estimate an allowance for expected credit losses on the Company's reinsurance recoverable balances.

Overview 
 
 Oscar Health, Inc. is a leading healthcare technology company, whose mission is to make a healthier life accessible and affordable for all. Our full stack technology platform refers to our differentiated cloud-native end-to-end technology solution, which connects our member-facing features, including our mobile application, website, and virtual care solutions with our back-office tools that span all critical healthcare insurance and technology domains, including member and provider data, utilization management, claims management, billing, and benefits. Our member-first philosophy and innovative approach to care has earned the trust of approximately 1.65 million members, as of September 30, 2024. We currently offer individual and family as well as small group plans and we offer services through +Oscar that utilize our full stack technology platform to power others within the healthcare space. 
 
 We regularly review our Total Revenue, Medical Loss Ratio MLR ), Selling, General and Administrative Expense Ratio SG A Expense Ratio ), and Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA , a non-GAAP financial metric) to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe these operational and financial measures are useful in evaluating our performance, in addition to our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Total Revenue 
 
 Total revenue includes Premium revenue, Investment income, and Services and other revenue. We believe Total revenue is an important metric to assess the growth of our business, as well as the earnings potential of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Premium revenue includes direct policy premiums collected from our members and from the federal government, risk adjustment transfers, and assumed policy premiums we receive as part of our reinsurance arrangement under our Cigna+Oscar Small Group plan offering, and is net of ceded premium from excess of loss ("XOL") and run-off quota share reinsurance contracts accounted for under reinsurance accounting. Investment income primarily includes investment income, interest earned, and gains (losses) on our investment portfolio. Services and other revenue includes primarily revenue earned from administrative services performed as part of the +Oscar platform, as well as sublease income.

 MLR 
 
 MLR is a metric used to calculate medical expenses as a percentage of net premiums before ceded quota share reinsurance. Medical expenses are the total expenses incurred by members in order to utilize health care services less any member cost sharing. These services include inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and physician costs. Medical claims also include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, provider disputed claims, risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers, and various other medical-related costs. The impact of the federal risk adjustment program is included in the denominator of our MLR. We believe MLR is an important metric to demonstrate the ratio of our costs to pay for healthcare of our members to the net premium before ceded reinsurance. MLR in our existing products are subject to various federal and state minimum requirements. 
 
 SG A Expense Ratio 
 
 The SG A Expense Ratio reflects the Company s Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of Total revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include distribution expenses, wages, benefits, costs of software and hardware, the impact of quota share reinsurance, stock-based compensation, and other administrative costs. We believe the SG A Expense Ratio is useful to evaluate our ability to manage our overall selling, general, and administrative cost base. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for stock-based compensation and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of our business, where applicable for the period presented. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. 
 
 We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. 
 
 By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with a reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, Net income (loss), we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for Net income (loss) or other financial statement data presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as indicators of financial performance. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from Net income (loss) is provided under Results of Operations-Adjusted EBITDA . 

Recent Developments, Trends and Other Factors Impacting Performance 
 
 Members 
 
 Our membership is measured as of a particular point in time and is concentrated in the individual market. Membership may vary throughout the year due to disenrollments, any Special Enrollment Periods SEP ), and other market dynamics that are in effect such as Medicaid redeterminations, other legislative or regulatory actions, or other factors that enable the overall market to grow or decline throughout the year.

 Risk Adjustment 
 
 The risk adjustment programs in the markets we serve are administered federally by Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS and are designed to mitigate the potential impact of adverse selection and provide stability for health insurers. Under this program, each plan is assigned a risk score based upon demographic information and current year claims information related to its members. The risk score is used to adjust plan revenue to reflect the relative risk of the plan's enrolled population. We reevaluate our risk adjustment transfer estimates as new information and market data becomes available until we receive the final reporting from CMS in later periods, up to twelve months in arrears. 
 
 Our risk adjustment transfer estimates are subject to a high degree of estimation and variability and are affected by the relative risk of our members, and in the case of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA") risk adjustment program, relative to that of other insurers. There is a higher degree of uncertainty associated with estimates of risk adjustment transfers at the beginning of the policy year resulting from composition of the risk score being based on concurrent claim data. There is additional uncertainty for both markets and blocks of business that experience outsized growth, compounded by the lack of credible experience data on the newly enrolling population. Furthermore, there is also uncertainty associated with changes in other carriers operations, which may impact the ultimate degree of market level risk. Actual risk adjustment calculations and transfers could materially differ from our assumptions. 
 
 Claims Incurred 
 
 Our medical expenses are impacted by seasonal effects of medical costs such as the utilization of deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums over the course of the policy year, which shifts more costs to us in the second half of the year as we pay a higher proportion of covered claims costs, and the number of days and holidays in a given period. Our medical and pharmacy costs can also exhibit seasonality depending on selection effects or changes in the risk profile of our membership and the proportion of our membership that is new in the calendar year. The emergence of medical and pharmacy claims is influenced by the aforementioned drivers, and further mix shifts may continue to alter claims incurred patterns in future periods. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Our business is generally affected by the seasonal patterns of our member enrollment, medical expenses, and health plan mix shift and product design. SEP or other market dynamics that drive enrollment and/or mix changes throughout the year may impact the per member levels of premiums, claims, and/or risk adjustment transfers. Additionally, medical expenses have historically been highest towards the second half of the year due to a number of factors discussed above. 
 
 Reinsurance 
 
 We believe our reinsurance agreements help us achieve important goals for our business, including risk management, capital efficiency, and greater predictability in our earnings in the event of unexpected significant fluctuations in our MLR. Specifically, reinsurance is a financial arrangement under which the reinsurer agrees to cover a portion of our medical claims in return for a portion of the premium. Our reinsurance agreements are contracted under two different types of arrangements: quota share reinsurance contracts and XOL reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance agreements do not relieve us of our primary medical claims incurred obligations. Refer to Note 9 - Reinsurance included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of the accounting methods used to record our quota share reinsurance arrangements.

 Regulatory Update 
 
 In December 2022, Congress passed the omnibus spending bill which delinked the Medicaid continuous coverage from the end of the public health emergency for COVID-19. Medicaid redeterminations were required to begin by April 1, 2023, and while most states initially anticipated completing unwinding-related renewals by mid-2024, many states have extended their unwinding timelines for several additional months, due to adoption of strategies to promote continuity of coverage for eligible individuals, pauses in procedural disenrollments, or other state-specific situations. CMS also previously announced an SEP that began March 31, 2023 and was expected to end July 31, 2024, but has been extended to November 30, 2024. While CMS guidance indicates that Medicaid redeterminations have been completed in certain states, CMS has recently announced that all unwinding-related renewals for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP must be completed no later than December 31, 2025. We continue to expect that consumers transitions from Medicaid and CHIP coverage to ACA marketplace plans may contribute to additional growth in the ACA marketplace. 
 
 On July 19, 2024, in response to increases in unauthorized changes in consumers enrollments by agents and brokers, CMS introduced changes to the ACA broker Agent of Record process, tightening compliance by requiring brokers to follow stricter documentation protocols and obtain explicit consumer consent. We continue to monitor regulatory developments to address bad actors, including possible changes to eligibility or income verification requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements by CMS. 
 
 Non-Renewal of Cigna+Oscar Partnership and Exit from Small Group Market 
 
 On March 26, 2024, the Company notified Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company that it is not renewing the Cigna+Oscar Small Group arrangement after the expiration of the initial term on December 31, 2024. The parties will continue to offer their Cigna+Oscar Small Group product through December 15, 2024. Additionally, effective December 15, 2024, Oscar will no longer be offering small group products in any market. Refer to Note 1 - Organization - Non-Renewal of Cigna+Oscar Partnership and Exit from the Small Group Market included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 Change Healthcare Incident 
 
 Change Healthcare CHC ), which provided claims clearinghouse and other services to the Company, experienced a cybersecurity incident on February 21, 2024. At this time, CHC has not notified the Company of any breach of our members data. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or complex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. As of September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from what was reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Membership 
 
 We view the number of members enrolled in our health plans as an important metric to help evaluate and estimate revenue and market share. Additionally, the more members we enroll, the more data we have, which allows us to improve the functionality of our platform. The following table summarizes the Company s membership by offering: 
 
 As of September 30, Membership by Offering 2024 2023 Individual and Small Group 1,602,993 912,761 Medicare Advantage 1,840 Cigna+Oscar (1) 
 51,291 68,559 Total Members (2) 
 1,654,284 983,160 (1) Represents total membership for our co-branded partnership with Cigna. (2) A member covered under more than one of our health plans counts as a single member for the purposes of this metric. 
 
 Membership increased by 671,124, or 68 , as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023. The increase in membership is a result of strong retention and new enrollments in existing and expansion markets further supported by ACA market growth in 2024. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in Cigna+Oscar members served and our exit from the Medicare Advantage market. 
 
 Premium 
 
 Premium revenue increased 976.2 million, or 70 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and increased 2,330.4 million, or 54 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were primarily driven by higher membership and rate increases, partially offset by higher risk adjustment transfers as a percentage of premiums. 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 Investment income increased 8.0 million, or 19 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and increased 23.4 million, or 20 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were due to a larger asset base, higher investment yields, and higher interest rates.

 Medical Expenses and MLR 
 
 Medical expenses increased 840.8 million, or 72 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and increased 1,830.7 million, or 53 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were primarily due to increased membership. MLR increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to modestly higher medical costs, primarily driven by higher SEP membership resulting in higher risk adjustment transfers as well as higher COVID-related costs, partially offset by favorable prior period development. MLR improved for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to favorable prior period development, partially offset by higher SEP membership resulting in higher risk adjustment transfers.

 (2) Represents prior period development for premiums ceded to reinsurers pursuant to quota share treaties accounted for under reinsurance accounting, which are in runoff. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and SG A Expense Ratio 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 134.5 million, or 41 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and increased 228.1 million, or 21 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were driven by higher distribution and selling expenses associated with higher membership year over year, partially offset by the impact of the acceleration of stock compensation expense associated with the cancellation of the Founders Awards in the first quarter of 2023. The SG A Expense Ratio improved 360 basis points year over year, and 500 basis points year over year for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to improved fixed cost leverage and variable cost efficiencies. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 1.7 million, or (18) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to less internally developed software placed into service. 
 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately (3.97) and (1.41) , respectively, and 4.12 and (3.51) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 We maintain liquidity at two levels of our corporate structure, through our health insurance subsidiaries (any subsidiary of Oscar Health, Inc. that has applied for or received a license, certification or authorization to sell health plans by any state Department of Insurance, Department of Financial Services, Department of Health, or comparable regulatory authority) and through our holding company (our parent company, Oscar Health, Inc., on a standalone basis Parent and subsidiaries excluding our health insurance subsidiaries). 
 
 The majority of the assets held by the holding company are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total cash and cash equivalents and investments held by the holding company was 260.1 million and 234.1 million, respectively, of which 12.7 million and 12.6 million was restricted for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The majority of the assets held by our health insurance subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total cash and cash equivalents and investments held by our health insurance subsidiaries was 3,413.8 million and 2,721.2 million, respectively, of which 17.3 million for both 2024 and 2023 was on deposit with regulators as required for statutory licensing purposes. These amounts are classified as restricted deposits on the balance sheet. 
 
 Our health insurance subsidiaries states of domicile have statutory minimum capital requirements that are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer s investments and products. The combined statutory capital and surplus of our health insurance subsidiaries was 1,068.0 million and 800.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which was in compliance with and in excess of the minimum capital requirements for each period. The health insurance subsidiaries historically have required capital contributions from Parent to maintain minimum levels. The health insurance subsidiaries may be subject to additional capital and surplus requirements in the future, as a result of factors such as increasing membership and medical costs, which may require us to incur additional indebtedness, sell capital stock, or access other sources of funding in order to fund such requirements. During periods of increased volatility, adverse securities and credit markets, including those due to rising interest rates, may exert downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers, and any such funding may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 As our health insurance subsidiaries have collectively become profitable and to the extent their levels of statutory capital and surplus continue to exceed minimum regulatory requirements, we may make periodic requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations or seek to enter into transactions or structures that enable us to efficiently deploy this excess capital, which may or may not require approval by our regulators. The health insurance subsidiaries paid dividends, distributions, and loan repayments of 52.0 million to Parent in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our health insurance subsidiaries have issued dividends and made loan repayments of 133 million to Parent. 
 
 Our health insurance subsidiaries also utilize quota share reinsurance arrangements to reduce our minimum capital and surplus requirements, which are designed to enable us to efficiently deploy capital to fund our growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, Parent made 99.8 million and 16.5 million of capital contributions, respectively, to the health insurance subsidiaries. We estimate that had we not had any quota share reinsurance arrangements in place, the health insurance subsidiaries would have been required to hold approximately 520.0 million and 447.1 million of additional capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which Parent would have been required to fund. The actual amount of any required capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries may differ at any given time depending on each health insurance subsidiary s capital adequacy.

 Short-Term Cash Requirements 
 The Company s cash requirements within the next twelve months include benefits payable, risk adjustment transfer payable, current lease liabilities, interest payable on debt, other current liabilities and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily funded by cash available for general corporate use, cash flows from current operations, and/or the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Based on our current forecast, we believe the Company's cash, and cash equivalents and investments, not including restricted cash, will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 Our cash flows used in operations may differ substantially from our net loss due to non-cash charges or due to changes in balance sheet accounts. The timing of our cash flows from operating activities can also vary among periods due to the timing of payments made or received. Some of our payments and receipts, including risk adjustment transfers and reinsurance receipts, can be significant. For example, during the third quarter of 2024, we made a payment through our health insurance subsidiaries of approximately 1,056.8 million into the risk adjustment program for the 2023 policy year. As such, timing of payments and receipts can influence cash flows from operating activities in any given period which would have a negative impact on our operating cash flows. 
 
 Long-Term Cash Requirements 
 Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include operating leases. We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. 
 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 
 During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, the conditional conversion feature of the 2031 Notes, which permits conversion upon satisfaction of the common stock sale price condition, was satisfied. As a result, the 2031 Notes are convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024 at the option of the holder. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the 2031 Notes have not been converted. Upon conversion, the 2031 Notes will be settled, at the Company s election, in shares of Class A common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 Oscar may not redeem the 2031 Notes at the Company s option prior to December 31, 2026. 
 
 For more information on our 2031 Notes, including the requirements for redemption, see in Note 15 - Long-Term Debt, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and, Note 7 Debt to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 We have 115.0 million available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility until December 2025, provided we are in compliance with all covenants. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. For more information on our Revolving Credit Facility, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Revolving Credit Facility in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 7 Debt to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Investments 
 
 We generally invest the cash of our health insurance subsidiaries in U.S. treasury and agency securities. We primarily invest the cash of the Company in investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. These investments are purchased pursuant to board-approved investment policies that reflect our obligations under our credit agreement and conform to applicable state laws and regulations. 
 
 Our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our health insurance subsidiaries may invest. These investment policies require that our investments of U.S. corporate bonds have final maturities of a maximum of two years from the settlement date and a maximum of five years from the settlement date for U.S. Government obligations. Professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. Our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments in a loss position. Net investment income for our health insurance subsidiaries was 47.8 million and 39.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 135.3 million and 114.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our restricted investments are invested principally in cash and cash equivalents and U.S. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and investments on deposit or pledged to various state agencies as a condition for licensure. We classify our restricted deposits as long-term given the requirement to maintain such assets on deposit with regulators. 

Summary of Cash Flows 
 
 Our primary operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income. Our primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, risk adjustment transfers, and operating expenses, including interest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 631.4 million as compared with 569.0 million used in operating activities for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher premiums received, which were partially offset by higher claim disbursements. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities primarily include the purchase and disposition of financial instruments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 1,356.0 million as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 404.7 million for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to an increase in purchases of securities and a lower level of maturing investment. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities may include proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and proceeds from stock option exercises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 64.6 million as compared to 5.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily attributable to potential changes in interest rates and/or inflation and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the fair value of our investment portfolio, which consists of U.S. treasury and agency securities, corporate notes, and certificates of deposit. Our primary market risk exposure is driven by changes to prime rate-based interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors, and other factors beyond our control. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1 increase in interest rates at September 30, 2024, the fair value of our investments would decrease by approximately 44.1 million. Any declines in interest rates over time would reduce our investment income.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
