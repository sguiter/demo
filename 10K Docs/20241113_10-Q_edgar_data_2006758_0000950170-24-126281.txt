 million during the prior fiscal quarter may be valued based on inputs identified by the Adviser without the necessity of obtaining valuation from an independent valuation firm, if once annually an independent valuation firm using the procedures described herein provides an independent assessment of value. Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, seniority of investment in the investee company s capital structure, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there were no significant changes to the Company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process.

of its investment company taxable income as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company (among other requirements) intend to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from corporate-level income taxes. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until we file our tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2024. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividend and distributions and other permanent book and tax difference are reclassified to paid-in capital. If we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated undistributed taxable income. If we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distribution would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitation under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividend-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the

Management s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal. 

term and thereafter will continue for successive annual periods provided that such continuance is specifically approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent trustees. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations. The Company pays the Adviser a fee for its services under the Advisory Agreement consisting of two components, a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. Substantial additional fees and expenses may also be charged by the Administrator to the Company, which is an affiliate of the Adviser. Base Management Fee The Management Fee is accrued monthly and paid quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company's net assets as of the beginning of the first business day of the applicable month. For these purposes, net assets means the Company s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For the first calendar quarter in which the Company has operations, net assets was measured as the average of net assets (i) at the date the Company first delivers a drawdown notice to its investors and (ii) at the end of such first calendar quarter. The Adviser has agreed to waive the management fee through March 15, 2025 and waive of the management fee and incentive fee from March 15, 2025 to March 15, 2026.

 per quarter annualized). We will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized); 

 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). This catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 

 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 

 (ii) Incentive Fee on Capital Gains The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year. Fees are computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. These calculations are for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. The Adviser has agreed to waive the incentive fee through March 15, 2025 and waive 50 of the incentive fee from March 15, 2025 to March 15, 2026. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized and respectively, of management fees, and and respectively, of performance-based incentive fees before impact of waived fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and respectively, of management fees, were waived and and respectively, of performance-based incentive fees were waived.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized and respectively, of servicing fees. The agreement with the Servicer terminated after the Conversion Date, when the Company elected to be regulated as a BDC. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement The Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain expenses (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest or distributions and/or servicing fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), the Company shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment . Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). No Reimbursement Payment for any month will be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share (as defined below) declared by the Company at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) our Operating Expense Ratio (as defined below) at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365 day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to Adviser, and interest expense, by our net assets. The Company s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity securities are primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA comparable multiples and market discount rates. The Company typically uses EBITDA comparable multiples on its equity securities to determine the fair value of investments. The Company uses market discount rates for debt securities to determine if the effective yield on a debt security is commensurate with the market yields for that type of debt security. If a debt security s effective yield is significantly less than the market yield for a similar debt security with a similar credit profile, the resulting fair value of the debt security may be lower. For certain investments where fair value is derived based on a recovery analysis, the Company uses underlying commodity prices from third party market pricing services to determine the fair value and/or recoverable amount, which represents the proceeds expected to be collected through asset sales or liquidation. Further, for certain investments, the Company also considered the probability of future events which are not in management s control. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the structured products include the discount rate applied in the valuation models in addition to default and recovery rates applied to projected cash flows in the valuation models. Specifically, when a discounted cash flow model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the discount rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment; conversely decreases in the discount rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks. For certain investments such as warrants, the Company may use an option pricing technique, of which the applicable method is the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method BSM ), to perform valuations. The BSM is a model of price variation over time of financial instruments, such as equity, that is used to determine the price of call or put options. Various inputs are required but the primary unobservable input into the BSM model is the underlying asset volatility.

Recent Developments 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10. Subsequent Events for a summary of recent developments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, credit worthiness of portfolio companies and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition to the discussion below, our significant accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company follows guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), where fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are determined within a framework that establishes a three-tier hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable market data and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to establish a classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value using a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs for the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the information available. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets or liabilities may not be an indication of the risks associated with investing in those assets or liabilities. 
 ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The level assigned to the investment valuations may not be indicative of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in such investments. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the consolidated financial statements may differ materially from the values that would be received upon an actual disposition of such investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 889.8 million or 99.1 of the Company s investments were classified as Level 3. The high proportion of Level 3 investments relative to our total investments is directly related to our investment philosophy and target portfolio, which consists primarily of long-term secured debt, as well as unsecured and mezzanine positions of private middle-market companies. A fundamental difference exists between our investments and those of comparable publicly traded fixed income investments, namely high-yield bonds, and this difference affects the valuation of our private investments relative to comparable publicly traded instruments. 
 55 

Table of Contents 

Senior secured loans, or senior loans, are higher in the capital structure than high-yield bonds, and are typically secured by assets of the borrowing company. This improves their recovery prospects in the event of default and affords senior loans a structural advantage over high-yield bonds. Many of the Company s investments are also privately negotiated and contain covenant protections that limit the issuer to take actions that could harm us as a creditor. High-yield bonds typically do not contain such covenants. 
 Given the structural advantages of capital seniority and covenant protection, the valuation of our private debt portfolio is driven more by investment specific credit factors than movements in the broader debt capital markets. Each security is evaluated individually and as indicated below, we value our private investments based upon a multi-step valuation process, including valuation recommendations from independent valuation firms.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our AP Leaf Secured Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), our capital commitments, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and repayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our short-term investments, our AP Leaf Secured Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months.

 The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company deems that certain money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). At the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider taking proactive steps utilizing cash

equivalents with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility during the following quarter, pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills from time-to-time on the last business day of the quarter and typically close out that position on the following business day, settling the sale transaction on a net cash basis with the purchase, subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize other balance sheet transactions, including calling capital commitments, as we deem appropriate. The amount of these transactions or such drawn cash for this purpose is excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base upon which the management fee is determined.

 Distributions 
 For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. Although the tax character of distributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include return of capital, the exact amount cannot be determined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until we file our tax return for the tax year ended December 31, 2024. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Our quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board. 
 To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. Although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. Currently, we have substantial net capital loss carryforwards and consequently do not expect to generate cumulative net capital gains in the foreseeable future. 
 We maintain an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for our shareholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the distribution reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions or fail to satisfy certain other conditions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we may suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual PIK, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may not be able to meet the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders. 
 PIK Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, PIK income totaled 0.7 million and 1.2 million on total investment income of 26.1 million and 74.4 million, respectively. In order to maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company s PIK income. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company s related party transactions. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Investment Valuation Risk 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board based on, among other things, the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to peri od. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Fair Value Measurements as well as Note 2 and Note 4 to our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information relating to our investment valuation . 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the majority of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which generally are SOFR-based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate) and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates, and many of which are subject to certain floors. Further, our AP Leaf Secured Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR rates with no interest rate floors. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

The following table shows the estimated annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate flows for variable rate instruments) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. From time to time, we may become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While we do not expect that the resolution of these matters if they arise would materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, resolution will be subject to various uncertainties and could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 None. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities

Exhibit 10.1 
 AMENDED AND RESTATED DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN 
 Effective: March 15, 2024 
 Amended and Restated: November 6, 2024 
 This Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the Plan is adopted by Middle Market Apollo Institutional Private Lending (the Fund ). 
 1. Distribution Reinvestment. As agent for the shareholders (the Shareholders of the Fund who (i) purchase the Fund s common shares of beneficial interest (the Shares pursuant to the Fund s private offering (the Offering ), or (ii) purchase Shares pursuant to any future offering of the Fund, and who do not opt out of participating in the Plan (the Participants ), the Fund will apply all dividends and other distributions declared and paid in respect of the Shares held by each Participant (the Distributions ), including Distributions paid with respect to any full or fractional Shares acquired under the Plan, to the purchase of additional Shares for such Participant. 

2. Effective Date. The effective date of this Plan shall be the date that the minimum offering requirements are met in connection with the Offering and the escrowed subscription proceeds are released to the Fund. 

3. Procedure for Participation. If any Shareholder initially elects not to be a Participant, they may later become a Participant by subsequently completing and executing an enrollment form or any appropriate authorization form as may be available from the Fund or State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Plan Administrator ). Participation in the Plan will begin with the next Distribution payable after acceptance of a Participant s subscription, enrollment or authorization. Shares will be purchased under the Plan as of the first calendar day of the month following the record date of the Distribution. 

4. Suitability. Each Participant is requested to promptly notify the Fund in writing if the Participant experiences a material change in his or her financial condition, including the failure to meet the income, net worth and investment concentration standards imposed by such Participant s state of residence and set forth in the Fund s most recent prospectus. For the avoidance of doubt, this request in no way shifts to the Participant the responsibility of the Fund s sponsor, or any other person selling shares on behalf of the Fund to the Participant to make every reasonable effort to determine that the purchase of Shares is a suitable and appropriate investment based on information provided by such Participant. 

5. Purchase of Shares. 

a. The Fund shall use newly-issued shares of its Shares to implement the Plan. The number of newly-issued shares to be issued to a Shareholder shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such Shareholder by a price equal to the net asset value as of the last day of the Fund s fiscal quarter immediately preceding the declaration date of the Distribution (unless the Board of Trustees determines to use the net asset value per share as of another time). Shares issued pursuant to the Plan will have the same voting rights as Shares issued pursuant to the Offering. The Fund shall pay the Plan Administrator s fees under the Plan. 

b. No upfront selling commissions will be payable with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the Plan, but such shares will be subject to ongoing distributor and/or shareholder servicing fees. Participants in the Plan may purchase fractional Shares so that 100 of the Distributions will be used to acquire Shares. 

6. Notice. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given by any provision of this Plan shall be in writing and addressed to Middle Market Apollo Institutional Private Lending, c/o State Street Bank and Trust Company if to the Plan Administrator, or such other addresses as may be specified by written notice to all Participants. Notices to a Participant may be given by letter addressed to the Participant at the Participant s last address of record with the Fund. Each Participant shall notify the Fund promptly in writing of any change of address. 

1 

7. Taxes. THE REINVESTMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS DOES NOT RELIEVE A PARTICIPANT OF ANY INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MAY BE PAYABLE ON THE DISTRIBUTIONS. INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL TAX INCOME LIABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS MAY BE FOUND IN THE PUBLIC FILINGS MADE BY THE FUND WITH THE SEC. 

8. Share Certificates. The ownership of the Shares purchased through the Plan will be in book-entry form unless and until the Fund issues certificates for its outstanding Shares. 

9. Termination by Participant. A Participant may terminate participation in the Plan at any time, without penalty, by delivering notice to the Plan Administrator. Such notice must be received by the Plan Administrator 10 business days in advance of the first calendar day of the next month in order for a Participant s termination to be effective for such month. Any transfer of Shares by a Participant to a non-Participant will terminate participation in the Plan with respect to the transferred Shares. If a Participant elects to tender its Shares in full, any Shares issued to the Participant under the Plan subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer will be considered part of the Participant s prior tender, and Participant s participation in the Plan will be terminated as of the valuation date of the applicable tender offer. Any distributions to be paid to such Shareholder on or after such date will be paid in cash on the scheduled distribution payment date. If a Participant terminates Plan participation, the Fund may, at its option, ensure that the terminating Participant s account will reflect the whole number of Shares in such Participant s account and provide a check for the cash value of any fractional share in such account. Upon termination of Plan participation for any reason, the Plan Administrator is authorized to deduct a 15.00 transaction fee plus a brokerage commission from the proceeds, and future Distributions will be distributed to the Shareholder in cash. 

10. Amendment, Suspension or Termination by the Fund. The Board of Trustees may by majority vote amend any aspect of the Plan; provided that the Plan cannot be amended to eliminate a Participant s right to terminate participation in the Plan and that notice of any material amendment must be provided to Participants at least 10 business days prior to the effective date of that amendment. The Board of Trustees may by majority vote suspend or terminate the Plan for any reason upon 30 business days written notice to the Participants. 

11. Liability of the Fund. The Fund shall not be liable for any act done in good faith, or for any good faith omission to act, including, without limitation, any claims or liability (i) arising out of failure to terminate a Participant s account upon such Participant s death prior to timely receipt of notice in writing of such death or (ii) with respect to the time and the prices at which Shares are purchased or sold for a Participant s account. To the extent that indemnification may apply to liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of a particular state, the Fund has been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC and certain state securities commissioners, such indemnification is contrary to public policy and, therefore, unenforceable. 

12. Applicable Law. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
