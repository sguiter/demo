 In June 2024, the Company entered into an agreement (as modified, the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract with Advanced Technology International, the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle s Consortium Management Firm funded by HHS BARDA, which was modified in September 2024 to increase funding and provide for the manufacturing of a vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. Pursuant to the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract, the Company will receive funding of up to million to conduct a Phase 2b comparative study evaluating the Company s oral pill COVID- 19 vaccine candidate against an mRNA vaccine comparator approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and manufacture a COVID- 19 vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract currently makes available an aggregate amount of up to million, consisting of fixed fee amounts totaling million and reimbursement of costs incurred in trial preparation and execution activities. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract further contemplates additional funding up to million if the Company and HHS BARDA decide to continue with the Phase 2b comparative study. The Company accounts for the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract under Accounting Standards Codification 958 - 605 and recognizes revenue as the firm fixed-price milestone is earned and allowable cost-plus-fixed-fees are incurred. Reimbursable costs under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract primarily include direct labor, subcontract costs, materials, travel, and approved overhead and indirect costs. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract contains terms and conditions that are customary for contracts with HHS BARDA of this nature, including the U.S. government having the right to terminate the contract for convenience or to terminate for default if the Company fails to meet its obligations as set forth in the statement of work. Revenue from government contracts recognized on the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract was million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on costs incurred and the achievement of a firm fixed-price milestone under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. Deferred government revenue represents amounts that have been received from HHS BARDA and the earnings process is not yet complete. Deferred government revenue in current liabilities was million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Management believes that if the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract were to be terminated prior to completion of the Phase 2b comparative study, the costs incurred through the effective date of such termination and any settlement costs resulting from such termination would be allowable costs. Cost reimbursement payments to the Company are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon annual audit by the government. Management believes that revenue for periods not yet audited will be recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and settlement. When the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made, revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly in the period that the adjustment is known. 
 
 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract 
 
 In January 2024, the Company was awarded a contract (as amended, the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract by HHS BARDA with a base and all options value of million. Under the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract, the Company received an award to support clinical trial planning activities for a Phase 2b clinical trial that would compare the Company s XBB vaccine candidate to an mRNA comparator to evaluate efficacy for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, systemic and mucosal immune induction, and adverse events. The 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract originally had a period of performance term that was set to expire in July 2024, but the Company entered into an amendment in July 2024 that extended the period of performance expiration date into October 2024. The Company accounts for the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract under Accounting Standards Codification 958 - 605 and recognizes revenue as donor-imposed conditions are met. Revenue from government contracts recognized on the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, based on the achievement of certain milestones under the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract. Deferred government revenue represents amounts that have been received from HHS BARDA and the earnings process is not yet complete. Deferred government revenue in current liabilities was million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Grant Revenue 
 
 In November 2022, the Company accepted a million grant to perform research and development work for the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation (the BMGF Grant and received million in advance that was recorded as restricted cash and deferred revenue. The Company received an additional million in July 2023 upon completion of certain milestones. The Company recognizes revenue under research contracts only when a contract is executed and the contract price is fixed or determinable. Revenue from the BMGF Grant was recognized in the period during which the related costs were incurred and the related services rendered, as the applicable conditions under the contract were met. Costs of contract revenue were recorded as a component of operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company recognized revenue from the BMGF Grant of and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company fully recognized revenue from the BMGF Grant during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

million cash payment to Aviragen in consideration for acquiring certain royalty rights Royalty Rights related to the approved product Inavir in the Japanese market. The Royalty Rights were obtained pursuant to the collaboration and license agreements (the License Agreement and a commercialization agreement that the Company entered into with Daiichi Sankyo. Per the terms of the RIAA, during the first royalty interest period of April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2025, HCRP is entitled to the first million and any cumulative remaining shortfall amount plus of the next million in royalties earned in each year commencing on April 1, with any excess revenue being retained by the Company. Further, during the second royalty interest period beginning April 1, 2025 and ending on December 24, 2029, HCRP is entitled to the first million and any cumulative remaining shortfall amount, plus of the next million in royalties, with any excess revenue being retained by the Company. A shortfall occurs when, during an annual period ending on March 31 st , for the first royalty interest period of April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2025, the Company s royalty payments fall below million; and million for the second royalty interest period of April 1, 2025 and ending on December 24, 2029, excluding the period of April 1, 2028 through December 24, 2029. In the event there shall remain any cumulative remaining shortfall amount as of December 24, 2029, any royalties received from Daiichi Sankyo subsequently by the Company would be payable to HCRP until the cumulative remaining shortfall amount has been paid. 
 
 For avoidance of doubt, the RIAA states, in the event there is a remaining cumulative remaining shortfall amount as of December 24, 2029, the Company shall not be obligated to pay HCRP any royalty payment beyond what the Company is paid from Daiichi Sankyo. The cumulative remaining shortfall amount is the aggregate amount of the remaining shortfall for each annual period, which was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Under the relevant accounting guidance, due to a limit on the amount of royalties that HCRP can earn under the RIAA, this transaction was accounted for as a liability that is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the arrangement. The Company has no obligation to pay any amounts to HCRP other than to pass through to HCRP its share of royalties as they are received from Daiichi Sankyo. To record the amortization of the liability, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received under the License Agreement and the payments that will be passed through to HCRP over the life of this agreement. Consequently, the Company imputes interest on the unamortized portion of the liability and records non-cash interest expense using an estimated effective interest rate. The royalties earned in each period that will be passed through to HCRP are recorded as non-cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties, with any excess not subject to pass-through being recorded as royalty revenue. When the pass-through royalties are paid to HCRP in the following quarter, the imputed liability related to sale of future royalties is commensurately reduced. The Company periodically assesses the expected royalty payments, and to the extent such payments are greater or less than the initial estimate, the Company adjusts the amortization of the liability and interest rate. As a result of this accounting, even though the Company does not retain HCRP s share of the royalties, it will continue to record non-cash revenue related to those royalties until the amount of the associated liability, including the related interest, is fully amortized. 
 
 The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

million of non-cancelable purchase commitments, principally for contract manufacturing and clinical services which are expected to be paid within the next year. In addition, the Company has operating lease commitments as detailed in Note 7 . 
 
 (b) Indemnifications 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third -party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with certain officers and directors which provide, among other things, that the Company will indemnify and advance expenses incurred in connection with certain actions, suits or proceedings to such officer or director, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements he or she may be required to pay in actions or proceedings which he or she is or may be made a party by reason of his or her position as a director, officer or other agent of the Company, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and the Company s Bylaws. The Company currently has directors and officers insurance. 
 
 (c) Litigation 

From time to time the Company may be involved in legal proceedings arising in connection with its business. Based on information currently available, the Company believes that the amount, or range, of reasonably possible losses in connection with any pending actions against it in excess of established reserves, in the aggregate, is indeterminable to its consolidated financial condition or cash flows. However, any current or future dispute resolution or legal proceeding, regardless of the merits of any such proceeding, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to run the Company successfully, and could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In August and September 2020, two substantially similar securities class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The first action, titled Himmelberg v. Vaxart, Inc. et al. was filed on August 24, 2020. The second action, titled Hovhannisyan v. Vaxart, Inc. et al. was filed on September 1, 2020 together, the Putative Class Action ). By Order dated September 17, 2020, the two actions were deemed related. On December 9, 2020, the court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs counsel. 
 
 On January 29, 2021, lead plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint. On July 8, 2021, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On May 14, 2021, the court granted lead plaintiffs request to amend the consolidated amended complaint and denied defendants motions to dismiss as moot. On June 10, 2021, lead plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated complaint, and on August 9, 2021, lead plaintiffs filed a corrected first amended consolidated complaint. The first amended consolidated complaint, as corrected, named certain of Vaxart s current and former executive officers and directors, as well as Armistice Capital, LLC Armistice ), as defendants. It claimed three violations of federal civil securities laws; violation of Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b - 5, as against the Company and all individual defendants; violation of Section 20 (a) of the Exchange Act, as against Armistice and all individual defendants; and violation of Section 20A of the Exchange Act against Armistice. The first amended consolidated complaint, as corrected, alleged that the defendants violated securities laws by misstating and/or omitting information regarding the Company s development of a norovirus vaccine, the vaccine manufacturing capabilities of a business counterparty, and the Company s involvement with Operation Warp Speed OWS and by engaging in a scheme to inflate Vaxart s stock price. The first amended consolidated complaint sought certification as a class action for similarly situated shareholders and sought, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages and attorneys fees and costs. On July 8, 2021, all defendants moved to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint. By Order dated December 22, 2021, the court granted the motion to dismiss by Armistice with leave to amend and otherwise denied the motions to dismiss. On July 27, 2022, lead plaintiffs filed a notice announcing that they had reached a partial settlement (the Partial Settlement to resolve all claims against the Company and its current or former officers and/or directors in their capacity as officers and/or directors of the Company (the Settling Defendants ). Pursuant to the Partial Settlement, the Company agreed to a settlement amount of million with 2.0 million to be paid by the Company and the remainder to be paid by the Company s insurers. On November 2, 2022, the Company paid the million settlement amount with respect to the Putative Class Action pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement reached in that case. On November 14, 2022, lead plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint that purported to include new allegations to support claims against Armistice. By Orders dated January 25, 2023, the court approved the Partial Settlement and entered judgment dismissing with prejudice all claims asserted in the Putative Class Action against the Settling Defendants. 
 
 On October 23, 2020, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, entitled Roth v. Armistice Capital LLC, et al. The complaint names Armistice and certain Armistice-related parties as defendants, asserting a violation of Exchange Act Section 16 (b) and seeking the disgorgement of short-swing profits. The complaint purports to bring the lawsuit on behalf of and for the benefit of the Company and names the Company as a nominal defendant for whose benefit damages are sought. Following discovery, a motion for summary judgment was filed by Armistice and the Armistice-related party defendants to dismiss the complaint. On March 27, 2024, the court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed all claims in the complaint in their entirety. On April 11, 2024, the Plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, commencing appellate proceedings. In June 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to the court of appeals to stay the appeal pending efforts to re-instate the complaint in the district court, which was granted by the court of appeals. In July 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion with the district court seeking to set aside the judgment and to re-instate the complaint. On August 15, 2024, the district court denied Plaintiff s motion to set aside the judgment. On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff re-filed its appeal with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which is currently pending. 
 
 On January 8, 2021, a purported shareholder, Phillip Chan, commenced a pro se lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California titled Chan v. Vaxart, Inc. et al. (the Opt-Out Action ), opting out of the consolidated Himmelberg v. Vaxart, Inc. et al. and Hovhannisyan v. Vaxart, Inc. et al. class actions, (together, the Putative Class Action ). Because this complaint is nearly identical to an earlier version of a complaint filed in the Putative Class Action, the Opt-Out Action has been stayed while the Putative Class Action is pending.

 Company Overview and Background 
 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of oral recombinant vaccines based on our Vector-Adjuvant-Antigen Standardized Technology VAAST proprietary oral vaccine platform. We are developing prophylactic vaccine candidates that target a range of infectious diseases, including norovirus (a widespread cause of acute gastroenteritis), coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 )), and influenza. In addition, we have generated preclinical data for our first therapeutic vaccine candidate targeting cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus HPV ). Our oral vaccines are designed to generate broad and durable immune responses that may protect against a wide range of infectious diseases and may be useful for the treatment of chronic viral infections and cancer. Our investigational vaccines are administered using a room temperature-stable tablet, rather than by injection. 

Vaxart Biosciences, Inc. was originally incorporated in California under the name West Coast Biologicals, Inc. in March 2004 and changed its name to Vaxart, Inc. Private Vaxart in July 2007, when it reincorporated in the state of Delaware. On February 13, 2018, Private Vaxart completed a reverse merger (the Merger with Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. Aviragen ), pursuant to which Private Vaxart survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aviragen. Under the terms of the Merger, Aviragen changed its name to Vaxart, Inc. and Private Vaxart changed its name to Vaxart Biosciences, Inc.

We are developing the following tablet vaccine candidates, which are all based on our proprietary platform:

Norovirus Vaccine . Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea, among people of all ages in the United States. Each year, on average in the United States, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and contributes to 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults. Virtually all norovirus disease is caused by norovirus GI and GII genotypes, and we are developing a bivalent vaccine candidate designed to protect against both. 

In September 2023, we announced that our Phase 2 GI.1 norovirus challenge study evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of the GI.1 component of our bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate met five of six primary endpoints based on preliminary topline data. The study achieved its primary endpoints of a statistically significant 29 relative reduction in the rate of norovirus infection between the vaccinated and placebo arms, a strong induction of norovirus-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and other immune response endpoints. Vaccination also led to a 21 relative reduction in norovirus acute gastroenteritis in the vaccine arm compared to placebo, but this was not statistically significant. In prespecified analyses, the study also showed an 85 relative decrease in viral shedding in the vaccine arm compared with placebo and no statistically significant difference in disease severity in the vaccinated cohort compared with placebo. The vaccine candidate was also safe and well tolerated with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. 
 
 In July 2023, we announced our Phase 2 placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate met all primary endpoints and our bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate was well-tolerated with robust immunogenicity based on preliminary topline data. Preliminary results showed robust increases in serum antibody responses across both doses at Day 29 relative to Day 1. Placebo subjects did not have a measurable increase in the antibody response. The vaccine candidate also had a favorable safety profile that included no vaccine-related serious adverse events and no dose limiting toxicity. Adverse event rates for both doses were similar to placebo. 
 
 In the second half of 2024, we received constructive feedback from the Food and Drug Administration FDA on our data for potential correlates of protection and next steps for our norovirus program. While we believe we have identified a functional antibody response that may be associated with protection for norovirus, the FDA requested new clinical data before proceeding with further review of our potential correlate. 
 
 In the Fall of 2022, we announced a Phase 1 study that would receive significant funding and support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to evaluate whether our bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate induces antibodies in the breast milk of lactating mothers and whether infants up to six months of age can acquire those antibodies by breastfeeding. Passive transfer of antibodies from mother to infant that are induced in milk may protect breastfeeding infants from infectious pathogens. We initiated this study in the fourth quarter of 2023 and announced positive top line results in April 2024. Top line results showed antibodies rose in lactating mothers who received the high dose of our bivalent vaccine candidate. Specifically, serum antibodies to norovirus rose on average 5.6 fold in response to the GI.1 virus strain and 4.4 fold in response to the GII.4 virus strain and breast milk antibodies to norovirus rose on average 4.0 fold in response to the GI.1 virus strain and 6.0 fold in response to the GII.4 virus strain. The vaccine was well tolerated with no vaccine-related serious adverse events and no dose-limiting pharmacotoxicity. As a grant recipient from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Vaxart has agreed to a global access commitment for use of its bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate, if proven effective and approved, in breastfeeding mothers from low- and middle-income countries. 
 
 We have also created additional norovirus GI.1 and GII.4 constructs that may be more potent than the constructs being evaluated in clinical trials. We are discussing the regulatory feedback from the FDA, clinical data on current constructs, and preclinical data generated on new constructs with certain key opinion leaders to assist us in determining the best way to progress our norovirus program. 

Coronavirus Vaccine. COVID-19, a severe respiratory tract infection caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is a major cause of hospitalization and death in the U.S. and worldwide. According to the CDC, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. While most COVID-19 restrictions, such as stay-at-home orders, have been lifted, COVID-19 continues to spread and remains a public health threat, not least due to the continuing emergence of new variants.

In September 2022, we announced the results from the first part of a two-part Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our oral COVID-19 (spike S protein only) vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1.1-S met both its primary and secondary endpoints based on topline data. VXA-CoV2-1.1-S was able to boost the serum antibody responses for volunteers that previously received an mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna). Serum neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan), a recognized correlate of protection, were boosted in this population from a geometric mean of 481 to 778, a fold rise of 1.6. Volunteers that had lower starting titers had larger increases than subjects that had higher titers. There were also substantial increases in the neutralizing antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4/5 in these volunteers as measured by sVNT assay. Increases in the mucosal IgA antibody responses (antibodies in the nose and mouth) were observed in approximately 50 of subjects. Subjects that had an increase in the mucosal IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S had an increase in IgA responses to other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4/5, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, demonstrating the cross-reactive nature of these immune readouts. We are not proceeding with the second part of the study. 
 
 In February 2021, we announced our Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our oral COVID-19 (S and nucleocapsid N proteins) vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1 met both its primary and secondary endpoints based on preliminary data. Initial results showing cross-reactive mucosal antibody responses were published in Science Translational Medicine . Additional detailed study results and mucosal durability data were reported in medRxiv in July 2022. 
 
 We have made a COVID-19 vaccine candidate that expresses only the S protein from the SARS-CoV-2 XBB strain. Based on preclinical data, our XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate is more potent than our prior COVID-19 vaccine constructs. We are also in the process of manufacturing a COVID-19 vaccine candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 KP.2 strain. 
 
 In January 2024, we were awarded a contract (the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority HHS BARDA ), a division of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response ASPR within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in an amount of 9.3 million to fund preparation for a Phase 2b clinical study involving 10,000 patients. In June 2024, we entered into an agreement (as modified, the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract with Advanced Technology International, the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle s Consortium Management Firm funded by HHS BARDA, which was modified in September 2024 to increase funding and scope. Pursuant to the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract, we will receive funding of up to 456.1 million to conduct the Phase 2b study and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. 
 
 The Phase 2b study is a double-blind, multi-center, randomized, comparator-controlled study to determine the relative efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Vaxart s oral pill COVID-19 vaccine candidate against an approved mRNA COVID-19 injectable vaccine in adults previously immunized against COVID-19 infection. The study design anticipates enrolling approximately 10,000 healthy adults 18 years and older in the United States with approximately 5,000 receiving our COVID-19 vaccine candidate and approximately 5,000 receiving an approved mRNA comparator. The Phase 2b study starts with a sentinel cohort of 400 individuals using the Company's XBB COVID-19 vaccine and an mRNA XBB comparator. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the FDA will review 30-day safety data of the sentinel cohort once enrollment is complete. The study will strive to enroll participants in line with U.S. demographics, as well as including at least 25 over the age of 65. 
 
 The Phase 2b study will measure efficacy for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, systemic and mucosal immune induction, and the incidence of adverse events. The primary endpoint is relative efficacy of Vaxart s COVID-19 vaccine candidate compared to an approved mRNA comparator for the prevention of symptomatic disease. Primary efficacy analysis will be performed when all participants have either discontinued or completed a study visit 12 months post-vaccination. An interim analysis for vaccine efficacy compared to an approved mRNA comparator may be performed when 255 events have been reached. 
 
 We initiated the sentinel cohort of the Phase 2b clinical trial in September 2024. Upon a favorable review by the DSMB and FDA, we anticipate initiating the second part of the Phase 2b clinical trial, aiming to enroll approximately 10,000 participants, in early 2025. 

Influenza Vaccine. Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. An estimated one billion cases of seasonal influenza occur annually worldwide, of which three to five million cases are considered severe, causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year. In the United States, between 9,000,000 to 41,000,000 people catch influenza annually, between 140,000 and 710,000 people are hospitalized with complications of influenza, and between 12,000 and 52,000 people die from influenza and its complications each year. 

In 2018, we completed a Phase 2 challenge study of our H1N1 flu vaccine candidate, which was funded through a 15.7 million contract with HHS BARDA. We announced that, in healthy volunteers immunized and then experimentally infected with H1 influenza, our H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine candidate reduced clinical disease by 39 relative to placebo. Fluzone, the market-leading injectable quadrivalent influenza vaccine, reduced clinical disease by 27 . Our tablet vaccine candidate also showed a favorable safety profile, indistinguishable from placebo. 
 
 We also presented data from the study demonstrating that our vaccine candidate elicited a significant expansion of mucosal homing receptor plasmablasts to approximately 60 of all activated B cells. We believe these mucosal plasmablasts are a key indicator of a protective mucosal immune response and a unique feature of our vaccine candidates. 
 
 We have also initiated early-stage development on novel vaccine constructs containing our own antigens to develop a universal influenza vaccine candidate. We had previously produced a non-GMP oral vaccine candidate containing certain proprietary antigens from Janssen Vaccines Prevention B.V. Janssen and tested the candidate in a preclinical challenge model. The preclinical study has been completed and we have submitted a report to Janssen. In August 2023, Janssen announced it would exit all vaccine and infectious disease R D programs aside from an E. coli preventive vaccine and continuing to provide access to marketed HIV products. Vaxart is no longer pursuing a universal influenza vaccine using Janssen intellectual property. 
 
 The Company intends to work with governments around the world to create pandemic monovalent influenza vaccines for emergency use or stockpiling, if requested. We are also continuing development of our preclinical seasonal and universal influenza vaccine candidates. 

HPV Therapeutic Vaccine . Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and in the United States with about 13,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States according to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition. Our first therapeutic oral vaccine candidate targets HPV 16 and HPV 18, the two strains responsible for 70 of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical dysplasia. 

We have tested our HPV 16 vaccine candidate in two different HPV 16 solid tumor models in mice. The HPV 16 vaccine candidate elicited T cell responses and promoted migration of the activated T cells into the tumors, leading to tumor cell killing. Mice that received our HPV 16 vaccine candidate showed a significant reduction in volume of their established tumors. 
 
 In October 2018, we filed a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for our first therapeutic vaccine candidate targeting HPV 16 and HPV 18 and we subsequently submitted our pre-IND briefing package. We received feedback from the FDA in January 2019 to support submission of an IND application to support initiation of clinical testing. 
 
 The Company remains engaged in discussions with regulatory agencies, governments, non-governmental organizations and other potential strategic parties to determine the best way to progress its HPV program. 
 
 Antivirals 

Through the Merger, we acquired two royalty earning products, Relenza and Inavir. We also acquired three Phase 2 clinical stage antiviral compounds and subsequently discontinued independent development of these compounds. However, for one of these, Vapendavir, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Altesa Biosciences, Inc. Altesa in July 2021, permitting Altesa to develop and commercialize this capsid-binding broad-spectrum antiviral. Altesa is conducting a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to evaluate the impact of Vapendavir on the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms following rhinovirus challenge. 

Relenza and Inavir are antivirals for the treatment of influenza, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, plc GSK and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited Daiichi Sankyo ), respectively. We have earned royalties on the net sales of Relenza and Inavir in Japan. The last patent for Relenza expired in July 2019 and the last patent for Inavir expires in August 2036. Sales of these antivirals vary significantly by quarter, because influenza virus activity displays strong seasonal cycles, and by year depending on the intensity and duration of the flu season, the impact COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, on seasonal influenza, and competition from other antivirals such as Tamiflu and Xofluza.

Financial Operations Overview 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Non-Cash Royalty Revenue Related to S al e of Future R oyalties 
 
 In April 2016, Aviragen sold certain royalty rights related to Inavir in the Japanese market for 20.0 million to HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. HCRP ). Under the terms of our agreement with HCRP, during the first royalty interest period of April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2025, HCRP is entitled to the first 3.0 million and any cumulative remaining shortfall amount plus 15 of the next 1.0 million in royalties earned in each year commencing on April 1, with any excess revenue being retained by us. Further, during the second royalty interest period beginning April 1, 2025 and ending on December 24, 2029, HCRP is entitled to the first 2.7 million and any cumulative remaining shortfall amount plus 15 of the next 1.0 million in royalties, with any excess revenue being retained by us. A shortfall occurs when, during an annual period ending on March 31 st , for the first royalty interest period of April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2025, royalty payments fall below 3.0 million; and 2.7 million for the second royalty interest period of April 1, 2025 and ending on December 24, 2029, excluding the period of April 1, 2028 through December 24, 2029. In the event there is a remaining cumulative remaining shortfall amount as of December 24, 2029, then, for so long as the Company continues to receive royalties from Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited Daiichi Sankyo ), the sum of those royalties will be paid to HCRP until the cumulative remaining shortfall amount has been paid in full. 
 
 For avoidance of doubt, we are not obligated to pay HCRP any royalty payment beyond what we are paid by Daiichi Sankyo. The cumulative remaining shortfall amount is the aggregate amount of the shortfall for each annual period, which was 6.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Revenue from Government Contracts 
 
 In January 2024, we were awarded the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract by HHS BARDA, with a base and all options value of 9.3 million. Under the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract, we received an award to support clinical trial planning activities for a Phase 2b clinical trial that would compare our XBB vaccine candidate to an mRNA comparator to evaluate efficacy for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, systemic and mucosal immune induction, and adverse events. Revenue from government contracts recognized on the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract was 0.9 million and 8.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, based on the achievement of certain milestones under the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. In September 2024, the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract was modified to increase funding and expand the scope to include the manufacture of a vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. Pursuant to the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract (as modified), we will receive funding of up to 456.1 million to conduct a Phase 2b comparative study evaluating our oral pill COVID-19 vaccine candidate against an mRNA vaccine comparator approved by the FDA and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract currently makes available an aggregate amount of up to 96.5 million, consisting of fixed fee amounts totaling 67.9 million and reimbursement of costs incurred in trial preparation and execution activities. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract further contemplates additional funding up to 359.6 million if we and HHS BARDA decide to continue with the Phase 2b comparative study. Revenue from government contracts recognized on the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract was 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on costs incurred and the achievement of a firm fixed-price milestone under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. 
 
 Grant Revenue 
 
 In November 2022, we accepted a grant (the BMGF Grant of 3.5 million to perform research and development work for the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and received 2.0 million in advance that was recorded as restricted cash and deferred revenue. We received an additional 1.5 million in July 2023 upon completion of certain milestones. We recognize revenue under research contracts only when a contract is executed and the contract price is fixed or determinable. Revenue from the BMGF Grant was recognized in the period during which the related costs were incurred and the related services rendered, as the applicable conditions under the contract were met. Costs of contract revenue were recorded as a component of operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We fully recognized revenue from the BMGF Grant during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses represent costs incurred on conducting research, such as developing our tablet vaccine platform, and supporting preclinical and clinical development activities of our tablet vaccine candidates. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the following: 

employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations CROs ), that conduct clinical trials on our behalf; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), that manufacture product used in the clinical trials; 

expenses incurred in procuring materials and for analytical and release testing services required to produce vaccine candidates used in clinical trials; 

process development expenses incurred internally and externally to improve the efficiency and yield of the bulk vaccine and tablet manufacturing activities 

laboratory supplies and vendor expenses related to preclinical research activities; 

consultant expenses for services supporting our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing activities; and 

facilities, depreciation and allocated overhead expenses. 

We do not allocate our internal expenses to specific programs. Our employees and other internal resources are not directly tied to any one research program and are typically deployed across multiple projects. Internal research and development expenses are presented as one total. 
 We have incurred significant external costs for CROs that conduct clinical trials on our behalf, and for CMOs that manufacture our tablet vaccine candidates, although these costs have decreased since 2022 since we now perform the majority of our manufacturing activities in-house. We have captured these external costs for each vaccine program. We do not allocate external costs incurred on preclinical research or process development to specific programs.

We expect to incur significant research and development expenses in 2024 and beyond as we advance our tablet vaccine candidates into and through clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our tablet vaccine candidates and prepare for a possible commercial launch, all of which will also require a significant investment in manufacturing and inventory related costs. To the extent that we enter into licensing, partnering or collaboration agreements, a significant portion of such costs may be borne by third parties. 
 
 The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our tablet vaccine candidates. The probability of successful commercialization of our tablet vaccine candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data obtained in future trials, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our tablet vaccine candidates. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, insurance, allocated expenses and expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit, accounting, public relations, market research and other consulting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Allocated expenses consist of rent, depreciation and other facilities-related expenses.

 Non-cash R oyalty R evenue Related to Sale of Future Royalties 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties from Daiichi Sankyo was 40,000 and 0.4 million , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 0.7 million and 0.8 million, respectively. We continue to have non-cash royalty revenue as all royalties received for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were required to be paid to HCRP. 
 
 Revenue from Government Contracts 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from government contracts was 4.9 million and zero, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 12.9 million and zero, respectively. The revenue from government contracts consists of the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract awarded to us in January 2024 and the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract awarded to us in June 2024. Revenue from the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract was 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue from the ATI-RRPV Contract was 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Grant Revenue 
 
 We recognized revenue from the BMGF Grant of zero and 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and zero and 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Re search and Development 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , research and development expenses increased by 64,000 , or 0 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, an increase in preclinical expenses across multiple programs and facilities expenses, offset by a decrease in clinical trial expenses related to our norovirus vaccine candidate, a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and personnel-related costs, and a decrease in manufacturing expenses. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by 1.9 million, or 4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in clinical trial expenses related to our norovirus vaccine candidate, stock-based compensation expense, severance and other personnel-related costs, offset by increases in clinical trial expenses as related to our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, manufacturing and preclinical expenses and facilities expenses. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gen eral and admin istrative expenses decreased by 0.6 million, or 12 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and directors and officers insurance costs, partially offset by increases in legal and other professional fees. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses, and directors and officers insurance costs, offset by increases in severance costs and legal and other professional fees.

 For the three months ended September 30,2024 , we recorded interest income of 1.0 million , a 41 increase from the 0.7 million interest income recorded in the three months ended September 30,2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded interest income of 1.9 million, a 7 decrease from the 2.1 million interest income recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in our cash, cash equivalents and investments balance. 
 
 Non-cash interest expense related to sale of future royalties representing imputed interest on the unamortized portion of the sale of future royalties liability, increased to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in non-cash royalty revenue payable to HCRP.

 The provision for income taxes was 18,000 and 39,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 84,000 and 87,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax charge relates to interest on an intercompany loan from a foreign subsidiary and a 5 withholding tax on royalty revenue earned on sales of Inavir in Japan, which is potentially recoverable as a foreign tax credit but expensed because we record a 100 valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The amount of income tax expense recorded is directly proportional to Inavir royalties, including the portion that we pass through to HCRP. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary source of financing is from the sale and issuance of common stock in public offerings as well as funding from HHS BARDA. In the past, we have also obtained funds from the issuance of common stock warrants, secured debt and preferred stock and from collaboration agreements. 
 
 In September 2021, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the September 2021 ATM ), under which we may offer and sell, from time to time through sales agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 100 million. We incurred direct expenses and paid sales commissions of up to 3.0 of gross proceeds from the sale of shares under the September 2021 ATM. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 7,719,641 shares were issued and sold under the September 2021 ATM for gross proceeds of 9.1 million, which, after deducting sales commissions and expenses incurred to date, resulted in net proceeds of 8.8 million. Effective October 18, 2024, the Company terminated the September 2021 ATM and discontinued all offers and sales of common stock thereunder. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. In September 2024, the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract was amended to increase funding and expand the scope to include the manufacture of a vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. Pursuant to the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract, we will receive funding of up to 456.1 million to conduct a Phase 2b comparative study evaluating our oral pill COVID-19 vaccine candidate against an mRNA vaccine comparator approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine candidate targeting the KP.2 strain. As of September 30, 2024, we received 65.4 million of cash payments under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, through the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have received 0.6 million under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Oppenheimer Co. Inc., relating to the issuance and sale by us in an underwritten registered direct offering of 50,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.80 per share. The gross proceeds to us from such offering were 40.0 million, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses paid by us, the net proceeds were 37.5 million. 
 
 In January 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement with RA Capital Healthcare Fund, L.P. pursuant to which 15,384,615 shares of our common stock were sold to RA Capital Healthcare Fund, L.P. at an offering price of 0.65 per share. The gross proceeds from the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement were 10.0 million and, after deducting offering expenses, the net proceeds were 9.9 million. 
 
 In January 2024, we were awarded the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract with a base and all options value of 9.3 million. Under the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract, we received an award to support clinical trial planning activities for a Phase 2b clinical trial that would compare our XBB vaccine candidate to an mRNA comparator to evaluate efficacy for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, systemic and mucosal immune induction, and adverse events. The 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract originally had a period of performance term that was set to expire in July 2024, but we entered into an amendment in July 2024 that extended the period of performance expiration date into October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we received approximately 9.3 million of cash payments under the 2024 ASPR-BARDA Contract.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 58.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe our existing funds are sufficient to fund us for at least one year from the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report. To continue operations thereafter, we expect that we will need to raise further capital, through the sale of additional securities or otherwise. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, most notably our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services. 
 
 We may fund a significant portion of our ongoing operations through partnering and collaboration agreements which, while reducing our risks and extending our cash runway, will also reduce our share of eventual revenues, if any, from our vaccine candidates. We may be able to fund certain activities with assistance from government programs. We may also fund our operations through debt financing, which would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. 
 
 However, due to several factors, including those outside management s control, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional financing transactions. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, management s plans include further reducing or delaying operating expenses. 
 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 

the timing and costs of our planned preclinical studies for our product candidates; 

the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials of our product candidates; 

our manufacturing capabilities, including the availability of contract manufacturing organizations to supply our product candidates at reasonable cost; 

the amount and timing of royalties received on sales of Inavir; 

the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 

the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals; 

revenue received from commercial sales of our future products, which will be subject to receipt of regulatory approval; 

the terms and timing of any future collaborations, licensing, consulting or other arrangements that we may enter into; 

the amount and timing of any payments that may be required in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of any patents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights; 

our ability to stay listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market; and 

the extent to which we in-license or acquire other products and technologies.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 
 We experienced negative cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, in the amounts of 37.4 million and 56.9 million, respectively. The cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to cash used to fund a net loss of 55.0 million and an increase in working capital of 3.8 million, partially offset by adjustments for net non-cash income related to depreciation and amortization, amortization of discount on investments, net, stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense related to sale of future royalties and non-cash revenue related to sale of future royalties totaling 13.7 million. The cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to cash used to fund a net loss of 65.1 million and a decrease in working capital of 8.4 million, partially offset by adjustments for net non-cash income related to depreciation and amortization, amortization of discount on investments, net, stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense related to sale of future royalties and non-cash revenue related to sale of future royalties totaling 16.5 million.

Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 31.2 million of cash to purchase investments, net of maturities, and used 0.5 million of cash to purchase property and equipment. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 30.7 million from maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, and used 1.9 million to purchase property and equipment, net of disposals. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 37.5 million from the sale of our common stock under the June 2024 Offering, net proceeds of 8.8 million from the sale of our common stock under the September 2021 ATM and net proceeds of 9.9 million from the sale of our common stock under the 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, partially offset by 0.2 million from common stock acquired to settle employee tax withholding liabilities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received net proceeds of 13.6 million from the sale of 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, 1.4 million from the sale of common stock under the September 2021 ATM and 0.3 million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

Long Term Debt, HCRP. Under an agreement executed in 2016, during the first royalty interest period of April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2025, we are obligated to pay HCRP the first 3.0 million and any cumulative remaining shortfall amount plus 15 of the next 1.0 million in royalties earned in each year commencing on April 1, with any excess revenue being retained by us. Further, during the second royalty interest period beginning April 1, 2025 and ending on December 24, 2029, HCRP is entitled to the first 2.7 million and any cumulative remaining shortfall amount plus 15 of the next 1.0 million in royalties, with any excess revenue being retained by us. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for further details. 
 
 Operating leases. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for further details of leases. 
 
 Purchase obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services. We consider all open purchase orders, which are generally enforceable and legally binding, to be commitments, although the terms may afford us the option to cancel based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. 
 
 Share-based payment arrangements . Beginning in 2022, we shifted from awarding only options to issuing a mixture of options and restricted stock units RSUs to our employees. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to outstanding unvested stock options and RSUs expected to vest was 15.9 million, which we expect to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of 2.3 years. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for further details on stock-based compensation expense recognized. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 
 
 Accrued Research and Development Expenses 
 
 We record accrued expenses for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials, and contract manufacturing activities. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided and include the costs incurred but not yet invoiced within other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs can be a significant component of our research and development expenses. 
 
 We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates.

Intangible Assets 
 
 Intangible assets acquired in the Merger were initially recorded at their estimated fair values of 20.3 million for developed technology related to Inavir which was, until it was revalued, being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of future royalties of 11.75 years. The developed technology related to Inavir was revalued at 5.0 million as of December 31, 2022, resulting in an impairment loss of 4.3 million being recorded. These valuations were prepared with the assistance of an independent third party based on discounted cash flows of estimated future revenue streams, which are highly subjective. The fair value as of September 30, 2024, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of 5.1 years. 
 
 Revenue from Government Contracts 
 
 Under firm fixed-price milestone contracts, we recognize the firm fixed-price revenue as the milestones are substantially complete and the firm fixed-price for the milestone is earned firm fixed-price milestone ). Under cost reimbursable contracts, we recognize revenue as allowable costs are incurred and the fixed fee is earned cost-plus-fixed-fee ). Reimbursable costs under the contract primarily include direct labor, subcontract costs, materials, equipment, travel, and approved overhead and indirect costs. Fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts are earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the work relative to total estimated contract costs, with such costs incurred representing a reasonable measurement of the proportional performance of the work completed. 
 
 Payments to us under cost reimbursable contracts are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon annual audit by the government. Management believes that revenue for periods not yet audited has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and settlement. When the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made, revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly in the period that the adjustment is known. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We measure the fair value of all stock option awards to employees, non-executive directors and consultants on the grant date, and record the fair value of these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense over the service period. The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the expense recorded is affected by subjective assumptions regarding a number of variables, as follows: 
 
 Expected term This represents the period that our stock-based awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (the arithmetic average of its original contractual term and its average vesting term). We have very limited historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for our stock-based awards. Based on the weighted average applied to options awarded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a notional 10 decrease in expected term would have reduced the fair value and the related compensation expense by approximately 2.1 . 
 
 Expected volatility This is a measure of the amount by which our common stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. Since the beginning of 2020, we have measured volatility based on the historical volatility of our own stock over the retrospective period corresponding to the expected term of the options on the measurement date. Based on the weighted average applied to options awarded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a notional 10 decrease in expected volatility (from 129.1 to 116.2 would have reduced the fair value and the related compensation expense by approximately 4.0 . 
 
 Risk-free interest rate This is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve on the measurement date corresponding with the expected term of the stock-based awards. 
 
 Expected dividend We have not made any dividend payments and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. 
 
 Forfeiture rate This is a measure of the number of awards that are expected to not vest and is reassessed quarterly. An increase in the estimated forfeiture rate will cause a small decrease in the related compensation expense early in the service period, but since the final expense recorded for each award is the number of options vested times their grant date fair value, it has no impact on the total expense recorded. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See the Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 for information related to the issuance of new accounting standards in the first nine months of 2024, which are either not applicable to its operations or their adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, maintain liquidity that is sufficient to meet cash needs and maximize total return without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this goal, we maintain our excess cash and cash equivalents in money market funds and marketable debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and we hold no equity securities. We presently have no borrowings or lines of credit. 
 
 Specifically, as of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately 58.7 million, which consist of primarily bank deposits, money market funds and U.S. government securities. All of our investments must satisfy high credit rating requirements at the time of purchase. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk, however, because our investments are rated highly and mostly short-term, we believe that our exposure to risk of loss due to interest rate changes is not significant. 
 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 
 Our royalty revenue, which is calculated in U.S. dollars, is based on sales in Japanese yen, so a 1 increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar against the yen would lead to a 1 reduction in royalty revenue and related accounts receivable. All our other revenue and substantially all of our expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses recently and do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant in the near future.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no material change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Vaxart have been detected.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The information included in Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies (c) Litigation to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 is incorporated by reference into this Item. 
 
 We may also from time to time be involved in legal proceedings arising in connection with our business. Based on information currently available, we believe that the amount, or range, of reasonably possible losses in connection with any pending actions against us in excess of established reserves, in the aggregate, is not material to our condensed consolidated financial condition or cash flows. However, any current or future dispute resolution or legal proceeding, regardless of the merits of any such proceeding, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to run our business successfully, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 You should consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2024, together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, when evaluating our business and our prospects. There are no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as described below. 
 
 A significant portion of the funding to further develop our COVID-19 vaccine candidate is currently expected to come from HHS BARDA funds. If HHS BARDA were to eliminate, reduce, delay, or object to funding available to us under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract, this could have a significant, negative impact on our revenues and cash flows, and we may be forced to suspend or terminate the continued development of the product candidate or obtain alternative sources of funding. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract with Advanced Technology International, the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle s Consortium Management Firm funded by HHS BARDA. In September 2024, the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract was amended to increase funding and scope. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract currently makes available an aggregate amount of up to approximately 96.5 million, consisting of a fixed fee of approximately 67.9 million and reimbursement of costs incurred in trial preparation and execution activities. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract further contemplates additional funding up to approximately 359.6 million if the Company and HHS BARDA decide to continue with the related study. As of September 30, 2024, we have recognized 4.2 million in revenue pursuant to the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract based on costs incurred. 
 
 We anticipate that a significant portion of the funding to further develop our COVID-19 vaccine candidate will come from the remaining amounts to be received under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract. The 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract provides that the government has the right to determine whether to fund the continued performance of the study after the initial funding. If the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract is terminated or suspended, or if there is any government decision not to continue funding or reduction or delay in funding under the 2024 ATI-RRPV Contract, our revenues and cash flows would be significantly and negatively impacted and we may be forced to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on no-dilutive terms, terms favorable to us, or at all. 
 
 Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. 

Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which imposes, among other requirements, a 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Our common stock traded for less than 1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, and we received notice of this from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market on July 2, 2024. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were granted a 180-calendar day grace period, or until December 30, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The minimum bid price requirement would be met if our common stock had a minimum closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day grace period. If at any time during this 180-calendar day period the bid price of the Company s common stock closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Nasdaq staff stated that it will provide the Company with a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. However, under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Nasdaq staff may exercise its discretion to extend this ten-day period as discussed in Rule 5810(c)(3)(H).

Alternatively, if we fail to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) prior to the expiration of the initial 180-calendar day period, we may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided (i) we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (except for the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement) and (ii) we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure this deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. In the event we do not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) prior to the expiration of the initial 180-calendar day period, and if it appears to the Staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are not otherwise eligible, the Staff stated that it will provide us with written notice that our securities are subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market. At that time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance or that Nasdaq will grant us a further extension of time to regain compliance, if necessary. 
 
 The delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future, or at all. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair our stockholders ability to sell or purchase our common stock when they wish to do so. Further, if our common stock were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock would cease to be recognized as a covered security and we would be subject to additional regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid requirement would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from falling below the Nasdaq minimum bid price required for continued listing again, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders equity or market values of our common stock, our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decrease. 
 
 Unless our common stock continues to be listed on a national securities exchange it will become subject to the so-called penny stock rules that impose restrictive sales practice requirements. 
 
 If we are unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, our common stock could become subject to the so-called penny stock rules if the shares have a market value of less than 5.00 per share. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to include any stock that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception for stock traded on a national securities exchange. The SEC regulations impose restrictive sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors as defined by relevant SEC rules. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. This means that if we are unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, the ability of stockholders to sell their common stock in the secondary market could be adversely affected. 
 
 If a transaction involving a penny stock is not exempt from the SEC s rule, a broker-dealer must deliver a disclosure schedule relating to the penny stock market to each investor prior to a transaction. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and its registered representative, current quotations for the penny stock, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the customer s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

 Project Identifier: RRPV24-04-NGVx-003 

 Project Title: Oral Mucosal Vaccine for SARS-CoV2 Protection 

 RRPV Member Organization Name: Vaxart, Inc. 

 Primary Place of Performance: 170 Harbor Way Suite 300 South San Francisco, CA 94080 

1.0 Introduction / Background 

Vaxart Biosciences, Inc. Vaxart is a development-stage biotechnology company with a pipeline of biologics across multiple therapeutic classes. Vaxart's platform technology makes it possible to administer vaccines in a thermo-stable tablet form, allowing for rapid deployment in mass vaccination programs, without the large logistical requirements and significant medical waste of conventional frozen vaccines. The vaccines are designed to trigger strong mucosal IgA and T-cell responses, as well as systemic antibodies. The technology is based on a non-replicating adenoviral vector with a molecular adjuvant that enhances antigen immune responses in the human intestine, the site of tablet release. 

This project will compare Vaxart s updated COVID-19 vaccine candidate that incorporates the XBB variant sequence (VXA-CoV2-XBB) to an mRNA comparator to evaluate efficacy for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, systemic and mucosal immune induction, and adverse events. 

2.0 Scope / Project Objective 

The objective of this project is to complete a phase 2b clinical trial, comparing Vaxart s XBB-strain Covid-19 candidate vaccine (VXA-CoV2-3.1) to an approved mRNA XBB-strain COVID-19 vaccine. Vaxart has divided the program into two phases. Phase 1 includes the execution of a Phase 2b clinical trial comparing Vaxart s XBB vaccine candidate and an mRNA vaccine comparator for efficacy, immune induction, and safety. Phase 2 includes further analysis to characterize the durability of the immune responses initially characterized by tracking mucosal samples from vaccinated individuals for a year, and assessing cross-reactivity over time. 

Phase 1: Clinical Trial Execution for Phase 2b Clinical Trial 

 Vaxart shall execute a Phase 2b clinical trial in approximately 10,000 individuals comparing Vaxart s XBB vaccine candidate and an mRNA vaccine comparator for efficacy, immune induction, and safety. The clinical trial will begin with a sentinel cohort of 400 individuals using Vaxart s XBB vaccine and an mRNA XBB comparator. 

Specifically, Vaxart will: 

Determine the relative efficacy of the Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate compared to the currently recommended booster dose for the prevention of symptomatic, PCR confirmed COVID-19 

Assess the safety and tolerability of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate 

Evaluate the humoral immunogenicity of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate 

Evaluate cellular immunogenicity of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate 

Evaluate the mucosal immune responses of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate 

Determine the durability of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate compared to the currently recommended booster dose for the prevention of symptomatic, PCR confirmed COVID-19 

Determine the relative efficacy of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate compared to the currently recommended booster dose for the prevention of asymptomatic, PCR confirmed COVID-19 

Determine the relative efficacy of Vaxart s XBB COVID-19 vaccine candidate compared to the currently recommended booster dose for the prevention of severe PCR confirmed COVID-19 

Efficacy subanalyses and Correlates of Protection analyses 

Concurrently, Vaxart will manufacture new KP.2 lots to support a 10,000 subject follow-on trial as described under Task Area 5 (1.5), CMC, below. 

PHASE 2: Additional Characterization of Immune Responses 

 Vaxart will expand on the durability of the immune responses initially characterized by tracking mucosal samples from vaccinated individuals for a year, and assessing cross-reactivity over time. Vaxart will characterize the B cell memory populations to understand how prior vaccination and infection exposure shapes the B cell repertoire. B cells elicited by vaccination will be cloned and characterized for the ability to produce cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses. Specifically, Vaxart will: 

To determine mucosal memory cell responses. 

Clone antibodies that bind to SARS-COV-2 and other coronaviruses induced by the two vaccines and evaluate cloned antibodies for cross-reactivity and affinity. 

3.0 Requirements 

Phase 1: Clinical Trial Execution for Phase 2b Clinical Trial (WBS 1) 

 Vaxart shall execute a Phase 2b clinical trial in approximately 10,000 individuals comparing Vaxart s XBB vaccine candidate and an mRNA vaccine comparator for efficacy, immune induction, and safety. The clinical trial will begin with a sentinel cohort of 400 individuals using Vaxart s XBB vaccine and an mRNA XBB comparator. 

Task Area #1 Program Management (WBS 1.1) 

 Vaxart s program management activities will follow procedures described in the Project Management Institute Project Management Book of Knowledge PMBOK ). These activities align with requirements established by the BARDA. Consistent with those requirements, the primary objective to program management is to ensure that the activities and outputs that result are delivered on time, within scope and budget, and meet applicable quality standards. 

Vaxart will undertake all of the required program management activities necessary to complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 of this project. 

The Principal Investigator (PI) for the project will work with Vaxart s program management team and will be responsible for the technical and contractual deliverables of the program. The Vaxart Program Team (VPT), which includes representatives from BARDA, will conduct weekly progress meetings through the period of performance. In addition, the VPT will conduct monthly performance reviews in accordance with the USG contract/communication plan requirements. (WBS 1.1.1) 

The Program Manager and Principal Investigator will have responsibility for deliverables from the Subcontractors. Each of the Subcontractors will be managed day-to-day by the program management team and the appropriate Vaxart Technical Lead. A Subcontract Management Plan will be submitted to BARDA within [ ] business days of award in accordance with the ASPR Business Toolkit. The Project Manager shall have the responsibility of reporting to BARDA any material subcontract issues that could impact the timing and quality of the program deliverables. (WBS 1.1.2) 

The PI and program management team are the leads and with the entire Project Teams input, have responsibility for Risk Identification and Mitigation. Included in this section is the generation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Security Plan within [ ] business days of contract award to be approved by BARDA. While monitoring risk will be on-going through the program and a topic for discussion in the telecons/meeting with BARDA, the Risk Register and associated documentation from the RMP will be updated no less than monthly and included in the Monthly Technical Progress Report to BARDA. (WBS 1.1.3) 

Vaxart will perform and report on program performance as directed by BARDA. Included in this activity is program cost accounting and invoicing. (WBS 1.1.4) 

Vaxart will maintain a quality management system to ensure that all activities carried out in accordance with the standards applicable to medical devices and pharmaceutical activities for clinical studies. Vaxart will use a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) with the key subcontractors in the program. The QASP, an element of Quality Management, will describe the methods used to monitor subcontractor performance, establish documentation/reporting requirements, and Vaxart s interactions with the subcontractor. The QASP is a means for evaluating whether the subcontractor is meeting the performance standards/quality levels identified in the project work plan and the contractor s quality control plan, and to ensure that the deliverables meet Vaxart s commitment to BARDA in the program. (WBS 1.1.5) 

As part of Vaxart s overall program management activities including subcontractor, risk and quality management activities will travel to sites as necessary to oversee the project. (WBS 1.1.6) 

Specific deliverables for WBS 1.1 subtasks are delineated in Section 4.0 Deliverables 

Task Area #2 Analytical (WBS 1.2) 

 Vaxart s analytical activities encompass those activities to be performed to collect, test, and report on samples taken from subjects in the Phase 2b trial. 

Vaxart will provide serum and PBMC samples to BARDA for analysis at a central CRO (WBS 1.2.1) . 

Serum samples will be taken from all subjects according to the schedule detailed in the synopsis. Samples will be shipped from the clinical sites to a central repository. Samples from the central repository will be shipped to the CRO contracted by BARDA to measure serum antibody responses. (WBS1.2.1.1) 

PBMC samples will be taken from greater than 1,000 subjects, according to the timeline plan detailed in the protocol. These will be processed using the BARDA method of PBMC isolation. Samples will be shipped with a liquid N2 dry shipper to a central repository and provided to the CRO contracted by BARDA to measure to measure T cell responses to SARS-Cov-2 S protein. Additionally, 200 subjects (0 and 7 days post vaccination) enrolled in the study will be collected and processed using the Vaxart method for isolation. These samples will be used for assessing mucosal memory and mucosal homing markers in Phase 2. 

BARDA and Vaxart will characterize immune responses at mucosal surfaces according to the schedule detailed in the synopsis. (WBS 1.2.2) 

To test the effects of mucosal vaccination, saliva samples will be collected using [ ] at timepoints post vaccination according to the schedule detailed in the synopsis. Samples will be shipped to the mucosal processing lab contracted by BARDA. Spike specific antibody levels will be assessed using MSD technology and functional antibodies (nAb) will be measured by [ ]. Vaxart will evaluate a small subset for pan-coronavirus immune responses and nAb using surrogate neutralization assays (sVNTs). (WBS 1.2.2.1) 

To test the effects of mucosal vaccination, nasal samples will be collected using Nasosorption devices (Mucosal Diagnostics) at timepoints post vaccination according to the schedule detailed in the synopsis. Samples will be shipped to the mucosal processing lab contracted by BARDA. Spike specific antibody levels will be assessed using MSD technology and functional antibodies (nAb) will be measured by [ ]. Vaxart will evaluate a small subset for pan-coronavirus immune responses and nAb using surrogate neutralization assays (sVNTs). (WBS 1.2.2.2) 

Vaxart will determine the efficacy of Vaxart s XBB vaccine candidate and the mRNA comparator vaccine against symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. (WBS 1.2.3) 

Subjects that report covid infection will be asked to provide nasal swab samples [ ] to determine duration of shedding. Any subject testing positive for symptomatic infection will be sequenced from the first positive sample to determine the breakthrough strain. (WBS 1.2.3.1) 

All subjects enrolled will be provided kits to swab weekly for SARS-COv-2 infection. Samples will be returned to a central lab by mail. Samples will be tested for asymptomatic infection.

6. Data Rights 

 Vaxart has filed broad domestic and international patents covering its proprietary technology and creations for oral vaccination using adenovirus and TLR3 (US patents 7,879,602 and 8,222,224). Vaxart has also filed for patent protection on their COVID-19 vaccine candidates. All intellectual property is fully owned by Vaxart, without any encumbrances. 

 Vaxart anticipates that it will utilize intellectual property (including patented inventions) in the performance of any contract that either has been developed at private expense (and in which Vaxart has ownership in the case of patented invention pursuant to FAR 52.227-11 or data pursuant to FAR 52.227-14), developed by a third-party (in which Vaxart has appropriate license rights) or pursuant to a prior government contract (in which case Vaxart has ownership rights as determined by that contract). Vaxart will provide a more detailed statement of rights in intellectual property for government review and approval (including any declarations of rights in intellectual property by Vaxart s subcontractors) and does not anticipate any impediments in Vaxart s ability to develop the vaccine technology based upon intellectual property that will be utilized in performance.
