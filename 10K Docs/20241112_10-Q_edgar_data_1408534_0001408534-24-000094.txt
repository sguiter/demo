 Litigation

Where it is probable that First Guaranty will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, First Guaranty records a liability in its consolidated financial statements.

First Guaranty Bank is a defendant in a lawsuit alleging fault for a loss of funds by a customer related to fraud by a third party with a possible loss range of to million. The Bank denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, which is in early stages and no trial date has been set. accrued liability has been recorded related to this lawsuit. First Guaranty settled a case in the third quarter of 2021 for million. A receivable for million was recorded for recovery by a claim against First Guaranty's insurer. During the second quarter of 2024, First Guaranty received million of the million receivable. The remaining million was written off. In the opinion of management, neither First Guaranty nor First Guaranty Bank is currently involved in such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that the resolution is expected to have a material adverse effect on First Guaranty s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in these ordinary claims or litigation against First Guaranty or First Guaranty Bank could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention, and may materially and adversely affect the reputation of First Guaranty and First Guaranty Bank, even if resolved favorably.

 Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 3.9 billion, an increase of 371.2 million, or 10.4 , from December 31, 2023. Assets increased primarily due to increases in investment securities of 259.9 million, cash and cash equivalents of 81.2 million and net loans of 18.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loans

First Guaranty's hotel and hospitality portfolio totaled 182.2 million at September 30, 2024. As part of the management of risks in our loan portfolio, First Guaranty had previously established an internal guidance limit of approximately 200.0 million for its hotel and hospitality portfolio. First Guaranty had 409.0 million in loans related to our Texas markets at September 30, 2024 which was an increase of 33.4 million or 8.9 from 375.7 million at December 31, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, 77.8 of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate. The largest portion of our loan portfolio, at 42.0 as of September 30, 2024, was non-farm non-residential loans secured by real estate. Approximately 53.9 of the loan portfolio was based on a floating rate tied to the prime rate, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), or Treasury rates as of September 30, 2024. 48.9 of the loan portfolio is scheduled to mature within five years from September 30, 2024. 
 
 Commercial real estate CRE has received increased regulatory scrutiny in recent quarters due to valuation concerns associated with the increase in market interest rates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. First Guaranty has utilized enhanced risk management practices for CRE concentration analysis for several years. First Guaranty Bank s credit department conducts an annual stress test for CRE related loans that is presented to the Bank s board of directors. The stress test analyzes the impact of changes in interest rates and cash flow on loan customers with credit exposures of 2.5 million or greater. First Guaranty generally requires personal guarantees on CRE loans. First Guaranty generally approves CRE loans with loan-to-values of 80 or less. First Guaranty also generally requires for construction related CRE loans that the borrower provides their equity contribution upfront before loan funds are advanced. 
 
 First Guaranty has diversified its CRE portfolio across both industries and geographic location. The following is a summary of the largest CRE related loans associated with hotel and motels, office properties, apartment complexes, healthcare related properties, and properties under construction as of September 30, 2024.

First Guaranty also has a 29.6 million loan for land development secured by a property located in Texas. 
 
 The increase in classified assets at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 was due to a 74.1 million increase in substandard loans offset by a 1.1 million decrease in doubtful loans. The increase in substandard loans was primarily the result of downgrades during the second quarter of 2024 of two related commercial loan relationships, with balances of 24.0 million and 18.2 million, from pass to substandard status, and one commercial loan relationship totaling 28.7 million downgraded during the third quarter of 2024, from special mention to substandard status. The 28.7 million commercial loan relationship was pass status at December 31, 2023. The decrease in doubtful loans was primarily the result of the payoff of a 0.4 million one-to-four family loan classified as doubtful during the first quarter of 2024. Special mention loans increased by 60.5 million in 2024. The increase in special mention loans was primarily the result of downgrades during the third quarter of 2024 of one multifamily loan totaling 26.0 million, one commercial lease loan relationship totaling 19.1 million, and one commercial real estate loan relationship totaling 8.6 million, from pass to special mention status. 
 
 Net loans are reduced by the allowance for credit losses which totaled 33.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 30.9 million at December 31, 2023.

Investment Securities 
 
 Investment securities at September 30, 2024 totaled 664.0 million, an increase of 259.9 million compared to 404.1 million at December 31, 2023. The portfolio consists of both available for sale (AFS) and held to maturity securities (HTM). The securities designated as held to maturity are agency and corporate debt securities that are part of First Guaranty s investment strategy and public funds collateralization program. We purchase securities for our investment portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk and meet pledging requirements for public funds and borrowings. 
 
 The securities portfolio consisted principally of U.S. Government and Government agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities and municipal bonds. U.S. government agencies consist of FHLB, Federal Farm Credit Bank ("FFCB"), Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae obligations. Mortgage-backed securities that we purchase are issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Management monitors the securities portfolio for both credit and interest rate risk. We generally limit the purchase of corporate securities to individual issuers to manage concentration and credit risk. Corporate securities generally have a maturity of 10 years or less. U.S. Government securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities that have maturities of less than two years. Government agency securities generally have maturities of 15 years or less. Agency mortgage-backed securities have stated final maturities of 15 to 20 years. 
 
 Our available for sale securities portfolio totaled 342.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 259.1 million, or 310.4 , compared to 83.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities. 
 
 Our held to maturity securities portfolio totaled 321.4 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.8 million, or 0.2 , compared to 320.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 256.3 million, or 38.6 , of the securities portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than one year. 13.3 million, or 2.0 , of the securities portfolio, not including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities, were scheduled to mature between one and five years. The majority of these securities were corporate bonds. 157.1 million, or 23.7 , of the securities portfolio, not including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities, were scheduled to mature between five and ten years. Securities, not including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities, with contractual maturity dates over 10 years totaled 182.1 million, or 27.4 , of the total securities portfolio at September 30, 2024. The average maturity of the securities portfolio is affected by call options that may be exercised by the issuer of the securities and are influenced by market interest rates. Prepayments of mortgages that collateralize mortgage-backed securities also affect the maturity of the securities portfolio. Based on internal forecasts as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the securities portfolio has a forecasted weighted average life of approximately 6.32 years based on the current interest rate environment. The portfolio had an estimated effective duration of 4.74 years at September 30, 2024. 
 
 There were no credit related impairment of available for sale securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses for held to maturity securities was 0.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 
 Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Loans are ordinarily placed on nonaccrual status when principal and interest is delinquent for 90 days or more. However, management may elect to continue the accrual when the asset is well secured and in the process of collection. It is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which we have reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest and a reasonable payment performance period is observed (generally considered six months or longer). Other real estate owned consists of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.

 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Nonaccrual loans: Real Estate: Construction and land development 2,815 530 Farmland 1,189 836 1- 4 family 9,563 6,985 Multifamily 537 537 Non-farm non-residential 42,414 9,740 Total Real Estate 56,518 18,628 Non-Real Estate: Agricultural 1,968 1,369 Commercial and industrial 3,711 1,581 Commercial leases 3,334 1,799 Consumer and other 257 1,810 Total Non-Real Estate 9,270 6,559 Total nonaccrual loans 65,788 25,187 Loans 90 days and greater delinquent accruing: Real Estate: Construction and land development Farmland 1- 4 family 77 124 Multifamily Non-farm non-residential 14,711 Total Real Estate 77 14,835 Non-Real Estate: Agricultural 57 Commercial and industrial 395 Commercial leases Consumer and other Total Non-Real Estate 452 Total loans 90 days and greater delinquent accruing 77 15,287 Total nonperforming loans 65,865 40,474 Real Estate Owned: Construction and land development 203 251 Farmland 1- 4 family 267 309 Multifamily Non-farm non-residential 690 690 Total Real Estate Owned 1,160 1,250 Total nonperforming assets 67,025 41,724 Nonperforming assets to total loans 2.42 1.52 Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.71 1.17 Nonperforming loans to total loans 2.38 1.47 Nonaccrual loans to total loans 2.38 0.92 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 50.59 122.79 Net loan charge-offs to average loans 0.62 0.17 
 
 -37- 

At September 30, 2024, nonperforming assets totaled 67.0 million, or 1.71 of total assets, compared to 41.7 million, or 1.17 , of total assets at December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of 25.3 million, or 60.6 . The increase in nonperforming assets occurred primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by a decrease in loans 90 days greater delinquent and still accruing and other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans included loans previously classified as purchase credit deteriorated following the adoption of CECL. 
 
 Nonaccrual loans increased from 25.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 65.8 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in nonaccrual loans was concentrated primarily in non-farm non-residential, one-to-four family, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, commercial leases, agricultural, and farmland loans. The largest increase in nonaccrual loans was associated with one commercial real estate relationship totaling 37.0 million. Nonaccrual loans included 2.0 million in loans with a government guarantee. These are structured as net loss guarantees in which up to 90 of loss exposure is covered. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, loans 90 days or greater delinquent and still accruing totaled 0.1 million, a decrease of 15.2 million compared to 15.3 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in loans 90 days or greater delinquent and still accruing was attributed to moving those loans to nonaccrual, and was concentrated primarily in non-farm non-residential, commercial and industrial, agricultural, and one-to-four family loans. 
 
 Other real estate owned totaled 1.2 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.1 million compared to 1.3 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our largest nonperforming assets were comprised of the following nonaccrual loans: (1) a 37.0 million non-farm non-residential loan relationship comprised of five loans with a specific reserve of 4.1 million; (2) a 3.3 million one- to four-family loan relationship; (3) a 1.8 million commercial real estate loan; (4) a commercial lease loan that totaled 1.7 million; (5) a commercial lease loan that totaled 1.6 million; (6) a 1.3 million one- to four-family loan relationship with a specific reserve of 0.5 million; and (7) a 1.3 million loan relationship that is classified as purchased credit deteriorated.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 First Guaranty adopted FASB ASC Topic 326 Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments Update No. 2016-13 ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. ASU 2016-13, referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL standard, requires financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to be presented at an amount net of an allowance for credit losses, which reflects expected losses for the full life of the financial asset. Unfunded lending commitments are also within the scope of this topic. Under prior GAAP losses were not recognized until the occurrence of the loss was probable. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans is maintained to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, offset by recoveries of previously charged-off loans and is decreased by loan charge-offs. The provision is a charge to current expense to provide for current expected loan losses and to maintain the allowance commensurate with management's evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Various factors are taken into consideration when determining the amount of the provision and the adequacy of the allowance. These factors include but are not limited to: 
 
 past due and nonperforming assets; 
 
 specific internal analysis of loans requiring special attention; 
 
 the current level of regulatory classified and criticized assets and the associated risk factors with each; 
 
 changes in underwriting standards or lending procedures and policies; 
 
 charge-off and recovery practices; 
 
 national and local economic and business conditions; 
 
 nature and volume of loans; 
 
 overall portfolio quality; 
 
 adequacy of loan collateral; 
 
 quality of loan review system and degree of oversight by our board of directors; 
 
 competition and legal and regulatory requirements on borrowers; 
 
 examinations of the loan portfolio by federal and state regulatory agencies and examinations; and 
 
 review by our internal loan review department and independent accountants. 
 
 The data collected from all sources in determining the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management with regard to current national and local economic trends, prior loss history, underlying collateral values, credit concentrations and industry risks. An estimate of potential loss on specific loans is developed in conjunction with an overall risk evaluation of the total loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as new information becomes available. 
 
 The allowance consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful, substandard, or collateral dependent. For such loans that are also classified as collateral dependent, an allowance is established when the collateral value is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified loans and special mention loans and is based on historical loss experience for the past three years adjusted for qualitative factors described above. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect the estimate of probable losses. 
 
 The balance in the allowance for credit losses is principally influenced by the provision for loan losses, recoveries, and by net loan loss experience. Additions to the allowance are charged to the provision for credit losses. Losses are charged to the allowance as incurred and recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance at the time recovery is collected. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans was 33.3 million, or 1.20 of total loans, and 50.5 of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Comparing September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023, there were changes within the specific components of the allowance balance. 
 
 A provision for credit losses of 14.0 million was made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The 14.0 million provision made in 2024 included a 1.3 million negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. First Guaranty's unfunded commitments declined during the first nine months of 2024 which resulted in a reduced liability. The provisions made were taken to provide for current credit losses and to maintain the allowance proportionate to risks inherent in the loan portfolio.

 Deposits 
 
 Managing the mix and pricing the maturities of deposit liabilities is an important factor affecting our ability to maximize our net interest margin. The strategies used to manage interest-bearing deposit liabilities are designed to adjust as the interest rate environment changes. We regularly assess our funding needs, deposit pricing and interest rate outlooks. From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, total deposits increased 420.8 million, or 14.0 , to 3.4 billion. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased 40.8 million, or 9.2 , to 402.0 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was primarily concentrated in individual and business noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 24.7 million, or 1.6 , to 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily concentrated in public funds interest-bearing demand deposits. Savings deposits increased 14.5 million, or 6.6 , to 233.5 million at September 30, 2024, primarily related to increases in business and individual savings deposits. Time deposits increased 471.8 million, or 57.5 , to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases in brokered time deposits. 
 
 Management will continue to evaluate and update our product mix and related technology in its efforts to attract additional customers. We currently offer a number of deposit products that are competitively priced and designed to attract and retain customers with primary emphasis on noninterest-bearing deposits, select time deposits and other lower cost deposits. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of outstanding certificates of deposit in amounts greater than 250,000 was approximately 197.1 million. At September 30, 2024, approximately 39.0 million of First Guaranty's certificates of deposit greater than 250,000 had a remaining term greater than one year. 
 
 The total amount of our uninsured deposits (deposits in excess of 250,000, as calculated in accordance with FDIC regulations) was estimated at 273.1 million at September 30, 2024. This total excludes public funds deposits that are collateralized by securities or FHLB letters of credit. The amount of uninsured deposits including collateralized public funds deposits was estimated at 847.6 million at September 30, 2024.

Public funds deposits totaled 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Public funds time deposits totaled 73.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 50.9 million at December 31, 2023. Public funds deposits increased due to new balances from existing customers that was primarily attributed to seasonal fluctuations. First Guaranty has developed a program for the retention and management of public funds deposits. Since the end of 2012, First Guaranty has maintained public funds deposits in excess of 400.0 million. These deposits are from public entities such as school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and municipalities. The majority of these funds are under fiscal agency agreements with terms of three years or less. Deposits under fiscal agency agreements are generally stable but public entities may maintain the ability to negotiate term deposits on a specific basis including with other financial institutions. These deposits generally have stable balances as we maintain both operating accounts and time deposits for these entities. There is a seasonal component to public deposit levels associated with annual tax collections. Public funds will increase at the end of the year and during the first quarter. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, there are monthly fluctuations associated with internal payroll and short-term tax collection accounts for our public funds deposit accounts. Public funds deposit accounts are collateralized by FHLB letters of credit, by expanded reciprocal deposit insurance programs, by Louisiana municipal bonds and by eligible government and government agency securities such as those issued by the FHLB, FFCB, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. First Guaranty continues to grow the proportion of its public funds portfolio that is collateralized by reciprocal deposit insurance as an alternative to pledging securities or utilizing FHLB letters of credit. First Guaranty initiated this strategy to invest these deposits more efficiently in higher yielding loans to improve the net interest margin and earnings. Total public funds collateralized by reciprocal deposit insurance programs decreased to 526.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 591.7 million at December 31, 2023.

 Total Shareholders' Equity 
 
 Total shareholders' equity increased to 256.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 249.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity was principally the result of an increase of 4.7 million in retained earnings, 0.3 million in surplus and a decrease of 1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The 4.7 million increase in retained earnings was primarily due to net income of 11.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by 5.0 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our common stock and 1.7 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our preferred stock. The 0.3 million increase in surplus was due to common stock issued under the Equity Bonus Plan during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily attributed to the decrease in unrealized losses on available for sale securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Results of Operations for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Performance Summary 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.9 million, an increase of 0.2 million, or 8.7 , from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was the result of several factors. First Guaranty experienced an increase in interest income, an increase in noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expense. This increased income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan losses. Loan interest income increased due to the growth in First Guaranty's loan portfolio, repricing of existing loans to higher market rates, including loan fees recognized as an adjustment to yield. Securities interest income increased due to an increase in the average yield of the investment portfolio. Noninterest income increased primarily due to an increase on gains on the sale of loans. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to decreased personnel expenses, legal and professional fees, travel and lodging, operating supplies, and marketing expense. Factors that offset the increase in net income included an increase in interest expense that was due to increases in volume of interest-bearing liabilities and market interest rates. The increase in the provision was related to changes within the portfolio and charge-offs experienced in the third quarter. Earnings per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.11 per common share, an increase of 10.0 or 0.01 per common share from 0.10 per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.4 million, an increase of 3.5 million, or 44.5 , from 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was the result of several factors. First Guaranty experienced an increase in interest income, an increase in noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expense. This increased income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and an increase in the provision for loan losses. Loan interest income increased due to the growth in First Guaranty's loan portfolio and repricing of existing loans to higher market rates, including loan fees recognized as an adjustment to yield. Securities interest income increased due to an increase in the average yield of the investment portfolio. Noninterest income increased primarily due to the net gain on sale of assets related to the sale-leaseback transaction and an increase on gains on the sale of loans. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to decreased legal and professional fees, marketing, travel and lodging, operating supplies, and data processing. Factors that partially offset the increase in net income included an increase in interest expense that was due to increases in volume of interest-bearing liabilities and market interest rates. The increase in the provision was related to changes within the portfolio and charge-offs experienced in 2024. Earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.78 per common share, an increase of 39.3 or 0.22 per common share from 0.56 per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Net Interest Income 
 
 Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. Interest rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, combine to affect net interest income. First Guaranty s assets and liabilities are generally most affected by changes in the Federal Funds rate, SOFR rate, short term Treasury rates such as one month and three month Treasury bills, and longer term Treasury rates such as the U.S. ten year Treasury rate. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. There may also be a time lag in the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities. It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds. 
 
 A financial institution's asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non-financial company, in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Accordingly, changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on a financial institution's performance. The impact of interest rate changes depends on the sensitivity to the change of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The effects of the changing interest rate environment in recent periods and our interest sensitivity position is discussed below. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.7 million and 20.4 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our total interest-earning assets and an increase in the average yield of our total interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the average rate of our total interest-bearing liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our total interest-earning assets increased by 412.3 million to 3.6 billion due to strong growth in our loan portfolio, and an increase in interest-earning deposits with banks. The average yield of our interest-earning assets increased by 42 basis points to 6.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an improved mix of higher yielding assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 466.8 million to 3.0 billion primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. The average rate of our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 35 basis points to 4.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The rise in market interest rates, particularly associated with Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in our liabilities cost. The primary source of the increase in liabilities cost was associated with the repricing of maturing time deposits to higher market rates along with interest bearing demand deposits for public funds that are primarily indexed to Treasury rates. As a result, our net interest rate spread increased 7 basis points to 1.80 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 3 basis points to 2.51 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 65.9 million and 63.7 million, respectively. The increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our total interest-earning assets and an increase in the average yield of our total interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the average rate of our total interest-bearing liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our total interest-earning assets increased by 394.3 million to 3.5 billion due to strong growth in our loan portfolio and an increase in interest-earning deposits with banks. The average yield of our interest-earning assets increased by 55 basis points to 6.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an improved mix of higher yielding assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 461.2 million to 2.9 billion primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. The average rate of our total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 74 basis points to 4.49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The rise in market interest rates, particularly associated with Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in our liabilities cost. The primary source of the increase in liabilities cost was associated with the repricing of maturing time deposits to higher market rates along with interest bearing demand deposits for public funds that are primarily indexed to Treasury rates. As a result, our net interest rate spread decreased 19 basis points to 1.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 23 basis points to 2.52 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

First Guaranty's loan portfolio expanded during the third quarter of 2024 due to growth associated with our loan originations and existing loans repriced to higher market rates. These factors contributed to the increase in interest income as the average balance of our total interest-earning assets, primarily associated with loans, increased, and the average yield of interest-earning assets increased. The average balance of our interest-earning assets increased 412.3 million to 3.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The average yield of interest-earning assets increased by 42 basis points to 6.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest income on securities increased 0.6 million to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in average balance and average yield of securities. The average balance of securities increased 12.5 million to 424.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 412.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a increase in the average balance of our U.S. Treasuries securities portfolio compared to the prior year. The average yield on securities increased 54 basis points to 2.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in lower yielding Treasury securities that matured in 2023. 
 
 Interest income on loans increased 6.4 million or 14.8 , to 49.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of an increase in the average balance and average yield of loans. The average balance of loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased by 178.7 million to 2.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely as a result of new loan originations. The average yield on loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased by 51 basis points to 7.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the improved mix of loans along with an increase in market interest rates. 
 
 Interest income on interest-earning deposits with banks increased 2.7 million to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks increased 219.3 million to 364.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 145.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased 31.3 million, or 23.6 , to 164.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. First Guaranty's loan portfolio expanded during the first nine months of 2024 due to growth associated with our loan originations and existing loans repriced to higher market rates. These factors contributed to the increase in interest income as the average balance of our total interest-earning assets, primarily associated with loans, increased, and the average yield of interest-earning assets increased. The average balance of our interest-earning assets increased 394.3 million to 3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year. The average yield of interest-earning assets increased by 55 basis points to 6.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest income on securities increased 0.8 million to 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in average yield of securities. The average yield on securities increased 39 basis points to 2.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in lower yielding Treasury securities that matured in 2023. The average balance of securities decreased 19.4 million to 396.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 415.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of our U.S. Treasuries securities portfolio compared to the prior year. 
 
 Interest income on loans increased 22.4 million or 18.4 , to 144.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of an increase in the average balance and average yield of loans. The average balance of loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased by 216.6 million to 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 largely as a result of new loan originations. The average yield on loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased by 58 basis points to 6.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the improved mix of loans along with an increase in market interest rates. 
 
 Interest income on interest-earning deposits with banks increased 8.0 million to 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period as a result of an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks increased 196.5 million to 299.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 103.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Interest Expense 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased 7.5 million, or 27.8 , to 34.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates and due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average rate of interest-bearing demand deposits was 4.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in market interest rates, particularly U.S. Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in rates paid on interest-bearing demand deposits. The largest concentration of interest-bearing demand deposits is associated with public funds deposits that are primarily indexed to Treasury rates. Treasury rates increased as the Federal Reserve increased rates to address increased inflation in the U.S. economy. The average rate of time deposits increased 105 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.85 as compared to the prior year period. The increase in the average rate of time deposits was due to changes in market rates as existing time deposits repriced to higher market rates. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 466.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 3.0 billion as compared to the prior year period. This increase was a result of a 69.9 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits, a 18.0 million increase in the average balance of savings deposits, a 358.2 million increase in the average balance of time deposits, and a 20.6 million increase in the average balance of borrowings. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased 29.1 million, or 42.1 , to 98.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 69.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in market interest rates and due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The average rate of interest-bearing demand deposits was 4.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in market interest rates, particularly U.S. Treasury rates, contributed to the increase in rates paid on interest-bearing demand deposits. The largest concentration of interest-bearing demand deposits is associated with public funds deposits that are primarily indexed to Treasury rates. Treasury rates increased as the Federal Reserve increased rates to address increased inflation in the U.S. economy. The average rate of time deposits increased 144 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.72 as compared to the prior year period. The increase in the average rate of time deposits was due to changes in market rates as existing time deposits repriced to higher market rates. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 461.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.9 billion as compared to the prior year period. This increase was a result of a 61.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits, a 18.2 million increase in the average balance of savings deposits, a 300.7 million increase in the average balance of time deposits, and a 81.0 million increase in the average balance of borrowings.

The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. 
 
 The net interest income yield shown below in the average balance sheet is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and is a measure of the efficiency of the earnings from balance sheet activities. It is affected by changes in the difference between interest on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the percentage of interest-earning assets funded by interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for Credit and Loan Losses 
 
 A provision for credit and loan losses is a charge to income in an amount that management believes is necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The provision is based on management's regular evaluation of current economic conditions in our specific markets as well as regionally and nationally, changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio, underlying collateral values securing loans, and other factors which deserve recognition in estimating loan losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events change. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 4.9 million compared to 0.6 million for the same period in 2023. The 4.9 million included a 0.5 million negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. Total charge-offs were 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. Charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were concentrated in consumer auto and equipment secured loans, unsecured consumer loans, consumer credit card loans, a loan relationship classified as purchased credit deteriorated, a commercial and industrial loan relationship, and a one- to four-family loan. Partially offsetting these charge-offs were recoveries that totaled 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 14.0 million compared to 1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The 14.0 million provision included a 1.3 million negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. Total charge-offs were 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.0 million for the same period in 2023. Charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were concentrated in consumer auto and equipment secured loans, unsecured consumer loans, a loan relationship that is classified as purchased credit deteriorated a loan relationship associated with a restaurant supply business located in Louisiana secured by real estate, equipment and inventory, and a commercial and industrial loan associated with the Main Street Lending Program. Partially offsetting these charge-offs were recoveries that totaled 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.2 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 We believe that the allowance is adequate to cover current expected losses in the loan portfolio given the current economic conditions, and current expected net charge-offs and nonperforming asset levels. Economic uncertainty may result in additional increases to the allowance for credit losses in future periods. 
 Noninterest Income 
 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are customer service fees, ATM and debit card fees, loan fees, gains on the sales of loans and available for sale securities and other service fees. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. 
 
 Noninterest income totaled 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.9 million from 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gains on the sale of loans. Service charges, commissions and fees totaled 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.9 million for the same period in 2023. ATM and debit card fees totaled 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net securities losses were 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net gains on the sale of loans were 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 for the same period in 2023. Net gains on the sale of assets were 31,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net losses of 7,000 for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest income totaled 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Noninterest income totaled 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.2 million from 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gains on sale of assets associated with the sale-leaseback transaction during the second quarter of 2024. Service charges, commissions and fees totaled 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.5 million for the same period in 2023. ATM and debit card fees totaled 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.4 million for the same period in 2023. Net securities losses were 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net gains on the sale of loans were 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12,000 for the same period in 2023. Net gains on the sale of assets were 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11,000 for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest income totaled 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.1 million for the same period in 2023.

Noninterest Expense 
 
 Noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense and other types of expenses. Noninterest expense totaled 19.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits expense totaled 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.1 million for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest expense totaled 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.4 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Noninterest expense totaled 59.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 59.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits expense totaled 30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense totaled 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 6.5 million for the same period in 2023. Other noninterest expense totaled 21.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 23.0 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of other noninterest expense: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other noninterest expense: Legal and professional fees 625 1,296 3,102 4,829 Data processing 413 497 1,196 1,559 ATM fees 424 448 1,237 1,271 Marketing and public relations 296 463 999 1,472 Taxes - sales, capital, and franchise 678 558 1,890 1,664 Operating supplies 41 224 247 664 Software expense and amortization 1,203 1,366 3,824 3,768 Travel and lodging 112 330 599 1,118 Telephone 135 96 378 264 Amortization of core deposit intangibles 174 174 522 522 Donations 58 148 241 574 Net costs from other real estate and repossessions 150 124 533 243 Regulatory assessment 1,182 676 3,105 2,112 Other 1,579 1,046 3,582 2,930 Total other noninterest expense 7,070 7,446 21,455 22,990 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of other non-deductible expenses and the statutory tax rate. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.6 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in income before income taxes. First Guaranty's statutory tax rate was 21.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.4 million and 2.4 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in income before income taxes. First Guaranty's statutory tax rate was 21.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity refers to the ability or flexibility to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations. Maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows us to have sufficient funds available to meet customer demand for loans, withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, interest-earning demand deposits with banks, federal funds sold and available for sale investment securities. 
 
 First Guaranty's cash and cash equivalents totaled 367.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 286.5 million at December 31, 2023. Loans maturing within one year or less at September 30, 2024 totaled 434.8 million compared to 357.7 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, time deposits maturing within one year or less totaled 773.8 million compared to 503.7 million at December 31, 2023. Time deposits maturing after one year through three years totaled 386.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 214.0 million at December 31, 2023. Time deposits maturing after three years totaled 132.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 103.0 million at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty's held to maturity ("HTM") securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 was 321.4 million, or 48.4 of the investment portfolio, compared to 320.6 million, or 79.3 at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty's available for sale ("AFS") securities portfolio was 342.6 million, or 51.6 of the investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 compared to 83.5 million, or 20.7 of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2023. The majority of the AFS portfolio was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 First Guaranty maintained a net borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank totaling 477.2 million and 259.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively with 135.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 compared to 205.0 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. The advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 were comprised of long-term advances that totaled 135.0 million. The 100.0 million FHLB long-term advance matures in the second quarter of 2027 and the 35.0 million FHLB long-term advance matures in the third quarter of 2027. The advances outstanding at December 31, 2023 were comprised of three long term advances totaling 155.0 million and two short-term advances that totaled 50.0 million. The change in borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank was due to changes in the value that First Guaranty receives on pledged collateral and due to First Guaranty's usage of the line. First Guaranty has increasingly transitioned public funds deposits into reciprocal deposit programs for collateralization as an alternative to FHLB letters of credit. We also maintain federal funds lines of credit at various correspondent banks with borrowing capacity of 100.5 million and one revolving line of credit totaling 20.0 million secured by a pledge of the Bank's common stock, with no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. We also have a discount window line with the Federal Reserve Bank that totaled 242.8 million at September 30, 2024 which was an increase of 23.7 million compared to availability of 219.1 million at December 31, 2023. First Guaranty did not have any advances under this facility at September 30, 2024. Management believes there is sufficient liquidity to satisfy current operating needs. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 First Guaranty's capital position is reflected in shareholders' equity, subject to certain adjustments for regulatory purposes. Further, our capital base allows us to take advantage of business opportunities while maintaining the level of resources we deem appropriate to address business risks inherent in daily operations. 
 
 Total shareholders' equity increased to 256.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 249.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity was principally the result of an increase of 4.7 million in retained earnings, 0.3 million in surplus and a decrease of 1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The 4.7 million increase in retained earnings was primarily due to net income of 11.4 million, partially offset by 5.0 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our common stock and 1.7 million in cash dividends paid on shares of our preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The 0.3 million increase in surplus was due to common stock issued under the Equity Bonus Plan during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily attributed to the decrease in unrealized losses on available for sale securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Regulatory Capital 
 
 Risk-based capital regulations adopted by the FDIC require banks to achieve and maintain specified ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. Similar capital regulations apply to bank holding companies over 3.0 billion in assets. The risk-based capital rules are designed to measure "Tier 1" capital (consisting of common equity, retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities, net of goodwill and other intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income) and total capital in relation to the credit risk of both on- and off- balance sheet items. Under the guidelines, one of its risk weights is applied to the different on-balance sheet items. Off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments, are also subject to risk weighting. Applicable bank holding companies and all banks must maintain a minimum total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8.00 , at least half of which must be in the form of core or Tier 1 capital. These guidelines also specify that bank holding companies that are experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels. 
 
 In order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, an institution must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank's capital conservation buffer was 3.64 exceeding the minimum of 2.50 . As of September 30, 2024, First Guaranty's capital conservation buffer was 2.79 exceeding the minimum of 2.50 . 
 
 As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the Federal Reserve Board has amended its small bank holding company and savings and loan holding company policy statement to provide that holding companies with consolidated assets of less than 3 billion that are (i) not engaged in significant nonbanking activities, (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and (3) do not have a material amount of SEC-registered debt or equity securities, other than trust preferred securities, that contribute to an organization's complexity, are no longer subject to regulatory capital requirements, effective August 30, 2018. On January 1, 2024, First Guaranty ceased being considered a "small bank holding company". Accordingly, both the Bank and First Guaranty are required to maintain specified ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. 
 
 In addition, as a result of the legislation, the federal banking agencies have developed a "Community Bank Leverage Ratio" (the ratio of a bank's Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A "qualifying community bank" that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered "well capitalized" under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution's risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies set the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9 . Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 8 beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio increased to 8.5 for the calendar year. Community banks will have until January 1, 2022, before the Community Bank Leverage Ratio requirement will return to 9 . A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank did not elect to follow the Community Bank Leverage Ratio. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements and were well capitalized within the meaning of federal regulatory requirements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk 
 
 Our asset/liability management (ALM) process consists of quantifying, analyzing and controlling interest rate risk (IRR) to maintain reasonably stable net interest income levels under various interest rate environments. The principal objective of ALM is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and to maintain adequate levels of liquidity. 
 
 The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, one of our most significant forms of market risk is interest rate risk, which is inherent in our lending and deposit-taking activities. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans secured by real estate and fixed rate securities in our investment portfolio, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The board of directors of First Guaranty Bank has established two committees, the management asset liability committee and the board investment committee, to oversee the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. The management asset liability committee is comprised of senior officers of the Bank and meets as needed to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position. The board ALCO investment committee is comprised of certain members of the board of directors of the Bank and meets monthly. The management asset liability committee provides a monthly report to the board ALCO investment committee. 
 
 The need for interest sensitivity gap management is most critical in times of rapid changes in overall interest rates. We generally seek to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by maintaining a relatively balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on a one-year time horizon and greater than one-year time horizon. Because of the significant impact on net interest margin from mismatches in repricing opportunities, we monitor the asset-liability mix periodically depending upon the management asset liability committee's assessment of current business conditions and the interest rate outlook. We maintain exposure to interest rate fluctuations within prudent levels using varying investment strategies. These strategies include, but are not limited to, frequent internal modeling of asset and liability values and behavior due to changes in interest rates. We monitor cash flow forecasts closely and evaluate the impact of both prepayments and extension risk. 
 
 -53- 

The following interest sensitivity analysis is one measurement of interest rate risk. This analysis reflects the contractual maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities over various time periods. This analysis does not factor in prepayments or interest rate floors on loans which may significantly change the report. This table includes nonaccrual loans in their respective maturity periods. The gap indicates whether more assets or liabilities are subject to repricing over a given time period. The interest sensitivity analysis at September 30, 2024 illustrated below reflects a liability-sensitive position with a negative cumulative gap on a one-year basis. 
 
 The interest spread and liability funding discussed below are directly related to changes in asset and liability mixes, volumes, maturities and repricing opportunities for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-sensitive assets and liabilities are those which are subject to repricing in the near term, including both floating or adjustable rate instruments and instruments approaching maturity. The interest sensitivity gap is the difference between total interest-sensitive assets and total interest-sensitive liabilities. Interest rates on our various asset and liability categories do not respond uniformly to changing market conditions. Interest rate risk is the degree to which interest rate fluctuations in the marketplace can affect net interest income.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), a Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. First Guaranty maintains such controls designed to ensure this material information is communicated to Management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report are effective. There were no changes in First Guaranty's internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter in the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, First Guaranty's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 First Guaranty is subject to various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business. First Guaranty assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings. Where it is probable that First Guaranty will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, First Guaranty records a liability in its consolidated financial statements. First Guaranty does not record a loss if the loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss is not estimable. First Guaranty was a defendant in a lawsuit alleging overpayment on a loan related to a disputed interest rate. This lawsuit was settled in the first quarter of 2023 for 0.6 million. First Guaranty Bank is a defendant in a lawsuit alleging fault for a loss of funds by a customer related to fraud by a third party, with a possible loss range of 0.0 million to 1.5 million. The Bank denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit, which is in early stages, and no trial has been set. No accrued liability has been recorded related to this lawsuit. First Guaranty settled a case in the third quarter of 2021 for 1.1 million. A receivable for 0.9 million was recorded for recovery by a claim against First Guaranty's insurer. During the second quarter of 2024, First Guaranty received 0.5 million of the 0.9 million receivable. The remaining 0.4 million was written off. In the opinion of management, neither First Guaranty nor First Guaranty Bank is currently involved in such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that the resolution is expected to have a material adverse effect on First Guaranty s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in these ordinary claims or litigation against First Guaranty or First Guaranty Bank could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention, and may materially and adversely affect the reputation of First Guaranty and First Guaranty Bank, even if resolved favorably.
