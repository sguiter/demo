Forward-looking statements are based on certain estimates, beliefs, expectations and assumptions made in light of management s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that may be appropriate. 
 Forward-looking statements necessarily involve unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in, or expressed or implied by such statements. Due to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions inherent in forward-looking information, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects can be found in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and applicable securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada on February 21, 2024 (the Annual Report on Form 10-K ), as supplemented by the risk factors in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in this Quarterly Report under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 general economic and business conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate; 

our ability to implement our strategic plan, including realization of benefits from certain cost-optimization initiatives undertaken since 2022 and into 2024, and the ability of our board of directors Board of Directors or Board to successfully implement its transformation plan; 

inflation and material fluctuations of commodity prices, including raw materials, and our ability to set prices for our products that satisfactorily adjust for inflation and fluctuations in commodity prices; 

volatility of our share price and potentially limited liquidity for U.S. investors due to our common shares being quoted on the OTC Pink Tier 

the availability of capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all, which may impact our liquidity and impair our ability to make investments in the business; 

turnover of our key executives and difficulties in recruiting or retaining key employees; 

our history of negative cash flow from operating activities; 

our ability to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flows; 

our ability to attract, train and retain qualified hourly labor on a timely basis to increase overall productive capacity in our manufacturing facilities to enable us to capture rising demand in the construction industry; 

our ability to achieve and manage growth effectively; 

competition in the interior construction industry; 

the voting influence of our two largest shareholders are able to exercise over the Company due to their ownership of our common shares; 

competitive behaviors by our co-founders and former executives; 

the condition and changing trends of the overall construction industry; 

our reliance on the network of Construction Partners (as defined herein) for sales, marketing and installation of our solutions; 

our ability to introduce new designs, solutions and technology and gain client and market acceptance; 

defects in our designing and manufacturing software and warranty and product liability claims brought against us; 

the effectiveness of our manufacturing processes and our success in implementing improvements to those processes; 

ii 

the effectiveness of certain elements of our administrative systems and the need for investment in those systems; 

shortages of supplies of certain key components and materials or disruption in supplies due to global events; 

global economic, political and social conditions affecting financial markets, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East; 

our exposure to currency exchange rates, tax rates, interest rates and other fluctuations, including those resulting from changes in laws or administrative practice, or changes in monetary policies; 

legal and regulatory proceedings brought against us;

cyber-attacks and other security breaches of our information and technology systems; 

damage to our information technology and software systems; 

our requirements to comply with applicable environmental, health, safety and other laws;

the effect of being governed by the corporate laws of a foreign country, including the difficulty of enforcing civil liabilities against directors and officers residing in a foreign country; 

the availability and treatment of government subsidies (including any current or future requirements to repay or return such subsidies); and 

future mergers, acquisitions, agreements, consolidations or other corporate transactions we may engage in. 

These risks are not exhaustive. Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual results, performance or achievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the anticipated or estimated results discussed in the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the effects of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or expressed or implied by, any forward-looking statements. Our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which represent our beliefs, assumptions and estimates only as of the dates on which they were made, as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even though circumstances may change in the future, except as required under applicable securities laws. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

DIRTT sells its products and services pursuant to fixed-price contracts which generally have a term of one year or less. The transaction price used in determining the amount of revenue to recognize from fixed-price contracts is based upon agreed contractual terms with each customer and is not subject to variability. 

Over time 

Revenue recognized at a point in time represents the majority of the Company s sales. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains legal title to the product, which is when ownership of the product is transferred to, or services are delivered to, the customer. Revenue recognized over time is limited to installation and ongoing maintenance contracts with customers and is recorded as performance obligations which are satisfied over the term of the contract. 

Deferred revenue 

Contract liabilities 

Contract liabilities primarily relate to deposits received from customers and maintenance revenue from license subscriptions. The balance of contract liabilities was lower as at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 mainly due to the timing of orders and payments.

DIRTT has one reportable segment: solutions. The DIRTT solutions segment derives revenues from customers by providing physical products and digital tools through our ICE software to create interior spaces for our customers across the commercial, healthcare, education and government industries. The solutions segment provides digital tools (access to ICE software) and physical products to create modular interior construction spaces for our customers. DIRTT s chief operating decision maker is the executive leadership team that includes the president and chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and the chief executive officer. The chief operating decision maker assesses performance for the solutions segment and decides how to allocate resources based on gross profit and net income (loss) that also is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as consolidated gross profit and net income (loss). The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets. The chief operating decision maker uses net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets (return on assets) in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the solutions segment or into other parts of the entity, such as to repay long-term debt. Gross profit and net income (loss) are used to monitor budget versus actual results. The chief operating decision maker also uses net income (loss) in competitive analysis by benchmarking to DIRTT s competitors. The competitive

The Support Agreement otherwise prohibits each of 22NW and WWT from acquiring any additional shares. To give effect to the terms of the Support Agreement, the Board adopted an amended and restated shareholder rights plan effective August 2, 2024 (the Amended and Restated SRP ), which amended and restated the Company's shareholder rights plan agreement originally adopted by the Board on March 22, 2024 (the Original SRP ). The Amended and Restated SRP was ratified by shareholders at the special meeting held on September 20, 2024 (the SRP Meeting ). The Amended and Restated SRP revised the definition of Exempt Acquisition in order to permit WWT to acquire additional common shares without triggering the provisions of the Amended and Restated SRP. The Amended and Restated SRP is otherwise consistent with the Original SRP and is substantially similar to the rights plan adopted by the Company in 2021. Like the Original SRP, the Amended and Restated SRP is intended to help ensure that all shareholders of the Company are treated fairly and equally in connection with any unsolicited take-over bid or other acquisition of control of the Company (including by way of a creeping take-over bid). The Amended and Restated SRP was not adopted in response to any specific proposal to acquire control of the Company, and the Board was not aware of any pending or potential take-over bid for the Company at the time of the adoption.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those described under the headings Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Summary of Financial Results

 Key Third Quarter Highlights 
 Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 43.4 million, a decrease of 6.2 million, or 12.4 , from 49.5 million for the same period of 2023, and an increase of 2.2 million, or 5.3 , from the second quarter of 2024. Third quarter revenue was in line with the expected guidance range of 40 million to 44 million provided last quarter. The decrease in revenue, as compared to the same period of 2023, was primarily the result of three large commercial projects and one large healthcare project that were completed in the third quarter of 2023 and were not repeated in the same period in 2024, partially offset by higher volume in the education sector. 

Gross profit and gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 16.8 million or 38.8 of revenue, a decrease of 0.3 million from 17.1 million or 34.4 of revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Gross Profit (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.6 million, a decrease of 0.7 million from 18.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the third quarter of 2024 was 40.7 as compared to 36.9 in the comparative period of 2023. These increases in Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are the result of improved material optimization to offset the inflationary impacts on material costs. 

Net income after tax for the third quarter of 2024 was 7.1 million compared to a 6.3 million net loss after tax for the same period of 2023. The increase in net income is primarily the result of a 7.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt relating to the Debenture Repurchase and the NCIB, a 7.5 million decrease in operating expenses (operating expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included an 8.0 million impairment charge on the Rock Hill Facility which was not repeated in the third quarter of 2024), and a 0.2 million increase in interest income, offset by a 0.3 million decrease in Gross Profit, a 1.2 million increase in foreign exchange loss, and a 0.3 million increase in interest expense. 

Adjusted EBITDA (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.1 million, or 9.4 of revenue, a decrease of 1.2 million from 5.3 million, or 10.6 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. Lower Adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by the decrease in gross profit and an increase in operating expenses due to the above noted reasons. 

26 

Cash on hand decreased by 15.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 to 23.9 million, compared to a 0.6 million increase in cash in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in cash in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by a 16.2 million repayment of long-term debt, 0.6 million in capital expenditures, offset by 1.5 million cash flows from operations. Our cash on hand was negatively impacted by a 0.6 million foreign exchange loss. 

On August 2, 2024, the Company and 22NW closed the Debenture Repurchase in which the Company purchased for cancellation an aggregate of C 18,915,000 principal amount of the January Debentures and C 13,638,000 principal amount of the December Debentures. As at September 30, 2024, C 16,642,000 principal amount of the January Debentures and C 15,587,000 principal amount of the December Debentures remain outstanding, and 22NW no longer holds any Debentures. 

On August 2, 2024, the Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Plan (the Amended and Restated SRP which superseded the plan adopted on March 22, 2024 and was approved by the Company s shareholders at a special meeting held on September 20, 2024 (the SRP Meeting ). The Company also entered a support and standstill agreement (the Support Agreement with 22NW, DIRTT s largest shareholder, and WWT Opportunity #1 LLC WWT ), DIRTT s second largest shareholder. The Support Agreement replaces the previously announced support and standstill agreement entered into with 22NW on March 22, 2024. 

On August 28, 2024, the Company commenced the NCIB for the Company s Debentures, which permits DIRTT to acquire up to C 1,664,200 principal amount of the January Debentures and C 1,558,700 principal amount of the December Debentures. As at September 30, 2024, C 0.1 million and C nil principal amounts of the December Debentures and January Debentures were acquired through the NCIB, respectively. 

Pipeline 
 The table below presents our qualified leads and twelve-month forward pipeline as at October 1, 2024, January 1, 2024 and October 1, 2023. We define qualified leads as the quantity of projects being pursued as of the date presented, and define our pipeline as the estimated potential revenue from qualified leads where a client has engaged DIRTT and is assessing DIRTT as a potential provider of prefabricated interior solutions. We believe these metrics are helpful to estimate near-term performance, particularly given the macroeconomic factors that affect our operating environment, including labor availability, interest rate changes, and potential recessionary impacts on construction projects. 
 As of October 1, 2024, our twelve-month forward pipeline decreased by 10 year-over-year and decreased by 6 from January 1, 2024, illustrated in the table below.

The October 1, 2023 pipeline included a large commercial project awarded to us in the first quarter of 2024, but the project was phased over a three-year period. As a result, the twelve-month pipeline decreased by 25 million while the project value remained in the full pipeline. After accounting for this phasing, the twelve-month pipeline decreased by 3 million. 
 27 

As shared in our outlook, the Company s revenue guidance for the second half of 2024 was 83 million to 93 million, as compared to revenue for the second half of 2023 of 100 million. The October 1, 2024 pipeline reflects the lower revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. We believe our pipeline has higher integrity and has more projects further along the process and therefore we are maintaining our revenue guidance for 2025 at 194 million to 209 million. 
 28 

Outlook 
 
 This quarter we continued on our Journey to Excellence, reporting net profit after tax of 7.1 million and 9.4 Adjusted EBITDA Margin. At September 30, 2024, we held 23.6 million in cash on hand with total liquidity (inclusive of borrowing availability) of 34.3 million. Improved operational results have also led to positive cash flow in the last six quarters. We have strengthened our balance sheet through the repurchase and cancellation of a significant portion of our debt. Our debt at September 30, 2024 is 23.9 million, down from 56.1 million at December 31, 2023. We expect to be in a position to pay off or refinance the remaining Debentures when they come due. 
 
 Construction is a multi-billion-dollar industry and growing. Increasing challenges, such as rising costs, labor shortages and environmental impact are leaving end users in search of a better alternative, which increases the business case to build with DIRTT. We believe that we stand apart from competition with project certainty, our core focus on sustainability, adaptability, and our custom is standard offering. 
 
 DIRTT s executive and senior leadership team met this fall to plan for the future. We finalized our new mission, vision and values and determined four strategic priorities for the next three years: Revenue growth, continued expansion of DIRTT s proprietary ICE software, accelerated innovation, and investment in talent. New leadership in our commercial organization is driving forward a commercial strategy focusing on our core principles as stated in our mission, vision and values. Our vision is to Transform how the world builds, which comes to life through what we view as our key differentiators: 
 Product Design: DIRTT s reconfigurable system offers a paradigm shift in how end users interact with their spaces. Our design offers a compelling alternative to conventional construction and our drywall alternative installs significantly faster and requires fewer trades 

Speed: Our industry-leading 10-business-day lead time is among the fastest in our peer group. We have delivered on that commitment more than 99 of the time year-to-date 

Quality: Our comprehensive 10-year warranty which typically exceeds conventional alternatives 

Innovation: Our 20-year ethos of custom is standard allows us to serve a diversity of clientele and respond to their needs 

Customer Service: Our sales representatives, project managers and internal teams are available to our customers to deliver on custom is standard as well as other organizational commitments 

Technology: Our ICE software (as defined below) provides an end-to-end system for customers to design and for DIRTT to manufacture a diverse mix of products at scale 

As we lean into these values, we continue to focus on removing bottlenecks for our commercial team and Construction Partners. We also continue to focus on accelerating pipeline growth from our new, diversified sales channels such as other prefabricators that are meaningfully contributing to our commercial strategy. We are reducing administrative tasks and offering our internal teams to support the sales cycle. We also enable our Construction Partners to pursue an increasing share of healthcare work through unique and differentiated products, such as our applied headwall offerings and the Clinical Observation Vertical Exam (the COVE ), a new innovative product designed to help improve patient care in emergency rooms. Just as we have implemented best practices for operational excellence in our plants, we are doing the same in our commercial organization. 
 
 Officially launching in November, we re already seeing positive demand for the COVE with interest from over 15 major health systems. The industry also recognized the COVE with two significant product awards for Most Innovative and Architect s Choice at the 2024 Healthcare Facilities Symposium and Expo. 
 
 A critical driver of our innovative process is our proprietary design integration software, ICE ICE or ICE Software ). We have committed to an ongoing process of enhancing this software to deliver more value and drive more efficiency. In Q3, in addition to launching ICE Manager and Design Editor, DIRTT s team made updates to enable our partners to rely less on the DIRTT support team to specify their designs in ICE. 

Our operations team continues to excel in its goal of zero defects, missed deliveries, and workplace injuries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total recordable incident rate (TRIF) rate was 0.63, which is 85 below the industry average. Our on-time in full (OTIF) delivery performance was 99.2 for the quarter. 
 
 We believe that DIRTT has significant untapped manufacturing capacity that can serve a multiple of our current revenue base. Improvements to our cost structure, including a materially reduced fixed cost base and incremental growth in revenue, will flow through to Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
 
 Looking at macroeconomic conditions through the third quarter of 2024, the US economy remains uncertain, but we are increasingly optimistic. On the positive side, inflation has tempered considerably from a high in 2022. Unemployment has only risen modestly during that period of disinflation. It appears that the US economy is on the path to a soft-landing scenario. With commercial office as our largest segment, factors affecting workplace investment and occupancy are closely monitored. We continue to see a slow but steady increase in Kastle Systems occupancy data as well as large employers continuing their requirement for in-person attendance. Conversely, the AIA/Deltek Architectural Billings Index continues its twentieth month of declining billings for architecture firms. Additionally, the interest rate environment has begun to ease, but the tailwinds of that reduction have yet to reach the commercial real estate market. Overall, we remain confident in our continued ability to navigate diverse economic environments through our exceptional operational excellence and continued focus on scaling our organization for profitable growth. 
 
 As we look forward, our year-over-year 12-month pipeline is 10 lower than 2023. However, this is almost exclusively driven by winning a bid for a three-year + 25 million opportunity which began production in Q2 and will continue shipping into 2026. Clients order large projects (> 1m USD) in phases due to install schedules. Our full pipeline continues to grow and reach post-COVID highs. As we analyze the integrity of our pipeline, we have more won work year-over-year which reinforces our view for revenue growth in 2025. We have maintained the 2024 and 2025 guidance numbers that were provided in our Q2 outlook: 
 2024 Revenue: 165-175 million 

2024 Adjusted EBITDA: 12-15 million 

2025 Revenue: 194-209 million 

2025 Adjusted EBITDA: 18-25 million 

We have minimal capital expenditure needs in the short term and with the availability of tax losses, we expect most of our Adjusted EBITDA will flow through to free cash flow. Our expected 2025 Adjusted EBITDA takes into account planned investments to achieve our strategic breakthroughs. The level of investments made will be finalized as we go through our budget process in the next quarter. We expect the Company will have approximately one turn of debt to Adjusted EBITDA financial leverage by the end of 2025 and we expect to have improved access to traditional bank lines. 
 DIRTT could not have achieved the past two years of organizational improvements without the support of our talented employee base. W e are advancing our goal to make DIRTT an employer of choice and we will aspire to maintain this stance in our industry. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These GAAP financial statements include non-cash charges and other charges and benefits that we believe are unusual or infrequent in nature or that we believe may make comparisons to our prior or future performance difficult. 
 As a result, we also provide financial information in this Quarterly Report that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its review and evaluation of the financial performance of the Company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional insight to investors and securities analysts as supplemental information to our GAAP results and as a basis to compare our financial performance period-over-period and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period and to other companies by removing the effects of our capital structure (net interest income on cash deposits, interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities, or foreign exchange movements), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax consequences, reorganization expense, unusual or infrequent charges or gains (such as gain on sale of software and patents, gain on extinguishment of debt, and impairment charges), stock-based compensation, related party expense, and government subsidies. We remove the impact of foreign exchange gain (loss) from Adjusted EBITDA. Foreign exchange gains and losses can vary significantly period-to-period due to the impact of changes in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary items on the balance sheet and are not reflective of the underlying operations of the Company. In periods where production levels are abnormally low, unallocated overheads are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In addition, management bases certain forward-looking estimates and budgets on non-GAAP financial measures, primarily Adjusted EBITDA. We have not reconciled non-GAAP forward-looking measures, including Adjusted EBITDA guidance, to its corresponding GAAP measures due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections, particularly with respect to non-operating income and expenditures, which are difficult to predict and subject to change. 
 Government subsidies, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, reorganization expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gain on extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, gain on sale of software and patents, net interest income on cash deposits, interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities, tax expense, and related party expense are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures because management considers them to be outside of the Company s core operating results, even though some of those receipts and expenses may recur, and because management believes that each of these items can distort the trends associated with the Company s ongoing performance. We believe that excluding these receipts and expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of the business operations, enhances consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not, or future periods that may not, include such items, and facilitates comparison with the results of other companies in our industry. 
 The following non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this Quarterly Report, and a description of the calculation for each measure is included. 

Adjusted Gross Profit 
 Gross profit before deductions for depreciation and amortization 

Adjusted Gross Profit Margin 
 Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue 

EBITDA 
 Net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA adjusted to remove foreign exchange gains or losses; impairment charges; reorganization expenses; stock-based compensation expense; government subsidies; unusual or infrequent charges and gains such as gain on sale of software and patents and gain on extinguishment of debt; related party expense; and any other non-core gains or losses 

Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue 

You should carefully evaluate these non-GAAP financial measures, the adjustments included in them, and the reasons we consider them appropriate for analysis supplemental to our GAAP information. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider any of these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. You should also be aware that we may recognize income or incur expenses in the future that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

Revenue 
 Revenue mainly reflects sales to our Construction Partners for resale to their clients and, in limited circumstances, our direct sales to clients. Our revenue is generally affected by the timing of when orders are executed, particularly large orders, which can add variability to our financial results and shift revenue between quarters.

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.4 million, a decrease of 6.2 million compared to 49.5 million in the comparative period of 2023, primarily due to three large commercial projects and one large healthcare project that were completed in the third quarter of 2023 and were not repeated in the same period in 2024, offset by higher volume in the education sector. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 125.4 million, a decrease of 5.6 million from 131.0 million in the comparative period of 2023. 
 Installation and other services revenue was 0.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and 3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million in the same period of 2023. Installation and other services revenue primarily reflects services performed by our ICE and design teams for third parties. Except in limited circumstances where it is beneficial for DIRTT to hold the contract or a requirement of the end customer, the Construction Partner, rather than the Company, perform and are responsible for the installation services. 
 Our success is partly dependent on our ability to profitably develop our Construction Partner network to expand our market penetration and ensure best practices are shared across local markets. At September 30, 2024, we had 74 Construction Partners (September 30, 2023: 71; December 31, 2023: 72) servicing multiple locations. 
 We periodically analyze our revenue growth by vertical markets in the defined markets of commercial, healthcare, government and education. Due to the concentration of large projects in our commercial and healthcare sectors in 2023, we are not seeing growth in these segments this year. We completed a large hospital system in 2023, and do not foresee completion of another project of that size until 2025. We secured several large commercial contracts in Q3 and Q4 of 2023 that we will not repeat this year.

 Commercial revenues decreased by 11 for the third quarter of 2024 from the prior year period. The quarter ended September 30, 2024 included fewer large commercial projects compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Healthcare revenues decreased by 18 in the third quarter of 2024 from the same period of 2023, primarily due to one large healthcare project completed in the third quarter of 2023. Healthcare sales tend to be larger individual projects and are subject to timing due to a typically longer sales cycle, resulting in variability in sales levels. Government revenues in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 18 from the prior year period. Similar to healthcare, government revenues tend to be larger individual projects. Education sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 6 from the same period of 2023. 
 Revenue continues to be derived almost exclusively from projects in North America and predominantly from the United States. The following table presents our revenue dispersion by geography:

The third quarter of 2024 included a lower proportion of sales to customers in the United States than to those in Canada, with 18 of sales for the period being in Canada and the rest occurring in the United States, compared to 11 of sales to Canada in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in Canadian revenue relative to total revenue is primarily the result of a large commercial project that will be active until 2026. Following completion of this project, we expect revenue to return to historic proportions of approximately 10-20 of revenue derived from Canada and 80-90 of revenue derived from the United States. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 1.0 million to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a 0.4 million decrease in commissions, a 0.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits costs, a 0.3 million decrease in pass through charges, and a 0.2 million decrease in other individual costs, offset by a 0.2 million increase in marketing and tradeshow expenses related to the Partner Camp event hosted by the Company for our Construction Partners and held at the end of the third quarter of 2024. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1.1 million to 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.3 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by a 1.0 million decrease in pass through charges, a 0.6 million decrease in building and infrastructure costs, a 0.1 million decrease in salaries and benefits costs, a 0.2 million decrease in commissions, a 0.1 million decrease in travel, meals and entertainment costs, a 0.1 million decrease in communications costs, and a 0.2 million decrease in depreciation costs, offset by a 0.9 million increase in termination benefits and a 0.3 million increase in marketing and tradeshow expenses. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.2 million to 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to a 1.1 million increase in professional services costs, a 0.1 million increase in salaries and benefits costs, and a 0.1 million increase in building costs, offset by a 0.1 million decrease in office costs, and a 0.1 million decrease in communications costs. Professional services costs increased as a result of the SRP Meeting held in the third quarter, the Debenture Repurchase, the Support Agreement and the NCIB that we commenced during the third quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.2 million to 14.8 million from 16.0 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by a 0.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits costs, a 0.5 million decrease in office costs, a 0.3 million decrease in communications costs, a 0.2 million decrease in public company costs, and a 0.4 million decrease in other individual costs, offset by a 0.7 million increase in professional services, and a 0.3 million increase in building and infrastructure costs. 
 Operations Support Expenses 
 Operations support is comprised primarily of project managers, order entry and other professionals that facilitate the integration of our Construction Partner project execution and our manufacturing operations. Operations support expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.9 million, an increase of 0.1 million from 1.8 million for the comparative period of 2023. 
 Operations support expenses decreased 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 5.5 million, from 5.6 million in the same period of 2023, driven by a 0.2 million decrease in salaries and benefits costs, a 0.1 million decrease in professional services costs, offset by a 0.1 million increase in travel meals and entertainment expenses, and a 0.1 million increase in research development costs. 
 Technology and Development Expenses 
 Technology and development expenses relate to non-capitalizable costs associated with our product and software development teams, and are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits of technical staff. 
 Technology and development expenses increased by 0.1 million to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to a 0.1 million increase in professional services costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, technology and development costs decreased by 0.1 million to 4.0 million, from 4.1 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily related to a 0.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits costs, and a 0.2 million decrease in building and infrastructure costs, offset by a 0.3 million write off of a previously capitalized software project, and a 0.1 million increase in professional services costs. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 Stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.8 million and 1.9 million, respectively, compared to 1.1 million and 2.5 million in the same periods of 2023. The decrease in this expense was largely due to a higher number of RSUs outstanding in the prior year s period compared to the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in RSU expense was offset by a higher DSU expense, as a result of a higher share price during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Reorganization 
 Reorganization expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million and 0.9 million, respectively from 0.3 million and 2.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Reorganization expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily relate to the movement of inventory and equipment from the Rock Hill Facility for use at the Calgary facility, while the reorganization costs in the third quarter of 2023 were largely made up of termination costs associated with actions taken to streamline our back office and operational support functions. 

Impairment Charge on Rock Hill Facility 
 On September 27, 2023, the Company decided to permanently close the Rock Hill Facility. The Company s reassessment of the useful lives of the manufacturing equipment at the Rock Hill Facility resulted in an 8.0 million impairment charge in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Certain assets, including manufacturing equipment, which met held-for-sale criteria at that time were reclassified from property, plant and equipment. At March 31, 2024, we determined that the assets held for sale balance of 0.5 million was to be reduced to nil, resulting in a 0.5 million impairment charge for the first quarter of 2024. We were not able to determine the likelihood of recoverability based on the current market interest in the equipment. 
 Related Party Expense 
 On March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Debt Settlement Agreement (the "Debt Settlement Agreement") with 22NW and Aron English, 22NW's principal and a director of DIRTT, (together, the "22NW Group") who, collectively, beneficially owned approximately 19.5 of the Company s issued and outstanding common shares at such time. Pursuant to the Debt Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to reimburse the 22NW Group for the costs incurred by the 22NW Group in connection with the contested director election at the annual and special meeting of shareholders of the Company held on April 26, 2022, being approximately 1.6 million (the Debt ). 
 Pursuant to the Debt Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to repay the Debt by either, or a combination of (i) a payment in cash by the Company to the 22NW Group, and/or (ii) the issuance of equity securities of the Company to the 22NW Group. 
 In connection with the Debt Settlement Agreement, on March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a share issuance agreement with the 22NW Group, pursuant to which the Company agreed to repay the Debt with the issuance to the 22NW Group of 3,899,745 common shares at a deemed price of 0.40 per common share, subject to approval by shareholders. 
 At the annual general and special meeting of shareholders held on May 30, 2023, shareholders voted to approve the issuance of common shares, and on June 2, 2023, the Company issued 3,899,745 common shares to 22NW Group as repayment for the Debt. Upon settlement, the debt was revalued at the higher of the deemed price of 0.40 per common share and the May 30, 2023 market price of 0.38 per common share resulting in a recovery from the balance recorded at March 31, 2023 which had been valued at a price of 0.53 per common share. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Convertible Debt 
 During the first nine months of 2024, C 43.1 million 31.7 million) in principal amount of Debentures was repurchased for cancellation through an Issuer Bid, a private repurchase, and a NCIB which triggered an extinguishment of debt. The gain on extinguishment of 7.5 million and 10.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, was calculated as the difference between the repayment and the net carrying value of the extinguished principal less unamortized issuance costs of C 1.2 million 0.9 million) (refer to Note 9 of our Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 

Gain on Sale of Software and Patents 
 On May 9, 2023, we entered into a Co-Ownership Agreement (the AWI Agreement and a partial patent assignment agreement with Armstrong World Industries, Inc. AWI ). The agreements provided for a cash payment from AWI to the Company of 10.0 million in exchange for the partial assignment to AWI and resulting co-ownership of a 50 interest in the rights, title and interests in certain intellectual property rights in the Applicable ICE Code, including a 50 interest in the patent rights that relate to the Applicable ICE Code. Pursuant to the AWI Agreement, we also provided AWI a transfer of knowledge concerning the source code of the Applicable ICE Code. In exchange for completing the knowledge transfer, we received an additional cash payment of 1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The AWI Agreement provides that we and AWI have separate exclusive fields of use and restrictive covenants with respect to the Applicable ICE Code and related intellectual property, which survive until either party elects to separate from its relationship with the other and for five years thereafter. We concurrently entered into the ARMSA with AWI, under which AWI has also prepaid for certain development services to be provided by DIRTT. The ARMSA will automatically terminate if the AWI Agreement is terminated or expires and may also be terminated if either party breaches the exclusive fields of use or restrictive covenants in the AWI Agreement. 
 The 10.0 million of proceeds on the sale of the 50 interest in the Applicable ICE code, pursuant to the Co-Ownership Agreement, was received during the second quarter of 2023. In accordance with GAAP, the proceeds were first applied to the net book value of the related cost of software of 2.9 million and patents (other assets) of 0.9 million and the residual amount of 6.1 million was recognized as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations. Further, 1.8 million was received during 2023 as a prepayment under the ARMSA, which was recognized into revenue during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Part of the proceeds of this transaction were used to settle one of our equipment leases of 1.6 million and resulted in the release of 0.4 million of restricted cash. 
 Foreign exchange gain or loss 
 Foreign exchange gain or loss decreased from a gain of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a loss of 0.4 million for the same period in 2024. Foreign exchange gain or loss increased from a 0.1 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to a 0.9 million gain for the same period in 2024. Approximately 60 of DIRTT s costs are denominated in the Canadian dollar. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3 million and 1.3 million compared to 0.2 million and 0.3 million for the same periods of 2023. The higher income is due to the interest earned on the Company s higher cash equivalents during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 0.3 million from 1.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 1.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and decreased by 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 3.5 million from 3.6 million in the comparative period of 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0.9 million of unamortized issuance costs related to Debentures were expensed as a result of the repurchase and cancellation of such debt, offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of debt during the period. 

Income Tax 
 Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 0.02 million and 0.4 million, respectively, from nil in the same periods of 2023. The current tax expense represents the income tax provision after the utilization of non-capital loss carry forwards against current period taxable income. The provision for income taxes comprises U.S. and Canadian federal, state and provincial taxes based on pre-tax income. Despite positive indications of future profitability, including the current period profit and strength of our pipeline, the Company has determined that it is unlikely that a deferred tax asset will be recognized. Given the recent history of losses, the Company will maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. As at September 30, 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance of 31.8 million (December 31, 2023: 34.5 million) against deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate indicators on whether a valuation allowance continues to be needed. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized a balance of its non-capital loss carry-forwards in Canada and the United States. As at September 30, 2024, we had C 94.7 million of non-capital loss carry-forwards in Canada and 51.3 million in the United States. These loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2037. 
 Net Income After Tax 
 Net income after tax increased by 13.4 million to 7.1 million, or 0.04 basic and 0.03 diluted net income per share, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from net loss of 6.3 million or a 0.05 net loss per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income after tax is primarily the result of a 7.5 million decrease in operating expenses (operating expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included an 8.0 million impairment charge on the Rock Hill facility which was not repeated in the third quarter of 2024), a 7.5 million gain on extinguishment of convertible debt as a result of the Debenture Repurchase (refer to Note 5 to our Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and a 0.2 million gain in interest income, offset by a 1.2 million increase in foreign exchange loss, a 0.3 million increase in interest expense and 0.3 million decrease in gross profit. 
 Net income after tax increased by 26.3 million to 10.7 million, or 0.06 basic and 0.05 diluted net income per share, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from a net loss of 15.5 million or 0.14 net loss per share, basic and diluted, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income after tax is primarily the result of a 14.0 million decrease in operating expenses, a 10.4 million gain on extinguishment of convertible debt as a result of the Issuer Bid, Debenture Repurchase and NCIB (refer to Note 5 to our Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), a 6.5 million increase in gross profit, a 1.0 million increase in foreign exchange gain, and a 1.0 million increase in interest income. This was offset by the non-reoccurrence of the 6.1 million gain on sale of software and patents and 0.2 million in government subsidies that were received in the comparative period of 2023, and a 0.4 million increase in income tax expense.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased by 1.2 million to 4.1 million and 9.4 , respectively, from 5.3 million and 10.6 in the same period of 2023. This primarily reflects a 0.7 million decrease in Adjusted Gross Profit, a 1.2 million increase in professional services costs offset by a 0.7 million decrease in commissions and pass through charges as a result of lower revenues. Professional services costs increased as a result of the SRP Meeting held in the third quarter as well as costs associated with the Debenture Repurchase, the Support Agreement and NCIB. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 6.3 million to 9.9 million or 7.9 , from 3.6 million or 2.7 in the same period of 2023. This primarily reflects a 4.4 million increase in Adjusted Gross Profit, a 1.3 million decrease in commissions and pass through charges as a result of lower revenues, a 0.6 million decrease in office costs, a 0.5 million decrease in building and infrastructure costs, a 0.4 million decrease in salaries and benefits costs, and a net 0.2 million decrease in individual costs, offset by a 0.8 million increase in professional services and a 0.3 million increase in loss on disposal relating to a write off of a previously capitalized software development project.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gross profit margin increased to 38.8 , from 34.4 for the same period of 2023. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin increased to 40.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 on 6.2 million in lower revenue, from 36.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit margin increased to 37.3 from 30.8 for the same period of 2023. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin increased to 39.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 34.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The improvement in Adjusted Gross Profit Margin was a result of material optimization to offset the inflationary impacts on material costs. Fixed costs decreased 0.3 million and 1.4 million for the quarter ended and year to date September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023 as we aligned overhead costs and support with current operations after having finalized the decision to close the Rock Hill Facility in the third quarter of 2023. Idle facility costs incurred at the Rock Hill Facility were 0.4 million and 1.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively (2023 0.4 million and 1.4 million). We continue to evaluate options to sublease the Rock Hill Facility to recover the costs of the facility. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As at September 30, 2024, the Company had 23.6 million of cash on hand and C 14.4 million 10.7 million) of available borrowings, compared to 24.7 million of cash on hand and C 13.6 million 10.3 million) of available borrowings as at December 31, 2023. Through the first nine months of 2024, the Company used 1.2 million of cash flow compared to 8.2 million cash generated in the first nine months of 2023. Cash flows were increased by the proceeds of the Rights Offering (as defined herein) of 21.3 million and improved operational results, offset by a 21.3 million repayment of debt under the Issuer Bid, Debenture Repurchase and NCIB, and a decrease in working capital of 7.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to normal seasonal receivable and payable build up. The first nine months of 2023 benefited from the receipt of 10.0 million of cash from the AWI sale (no similar transaction occurred in the first nine months of 2024), and a receipt of the 7.3 million of government subsidies. 
 We have implemented multiple price increases to mitigate the impact of inflation on raw materials and improve liquidity during the past two years. These actions have resulted in a meaningful improvement in our gross profit margins and higher net income, and have served to stabilize our cash usage to operate the business. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 46.8 million, or 37.3 of revenue. The same period of 2023 generated gross profit of 40.3 million, or 30.8 of revenue. 
 We have assessed the Company s liquidity as at September 30, 2024, taking into account our sales outlook for the next twelve months, our existing cash balances and available credit facilities. Based upon this analysis, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to remain a going concern for at least the next twelve months. 
 To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and available facilities are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our Debentures and our equity securities or contain instruments that may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any additional equity or debt financing may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. While we believe we can access capital markets when needed or under acceptable terms, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. 
 In addition, we have executed upon several initiatives to improve liquidity over the last two years. First, in May 2023, we entered into an agreement with AWI resulting in the receipt of 12.8 million of cash throughout 2023. Second, in May 2024, we extended our agreement to sublease our Dallas DXC to one of our Construction Partners in that region. Under the sublease agreement, the subtenant has assumed responsibility for the monthly rent, utilities, maintenance, taxes and other costs as of April 1, 2023, through October 31, 2028, providing us annualized savings of approximately 1.0 million. Third, in September 2024, we entered into an agreement to sublease the remainder of our facility in Phoenix. Under the sublease agreement, the subtenant has assumed responsibility for the monthly rent, utilities, maintenance, taxes and other costs as of October 1, 2024, through March 31, 2027, providing us annualized savings of approximately 0.6 million. We are continuing to pursue sublease opportunities for the Rock Hill Facility and expect these initiatives to result in positive cash inflows in 2025. Fourth, we completed a private placement of 8,667,449 common shares in November 2022 for aggregate gross proceeds of 2.8 million (the Private Placement with certain significant shareholders and directors and officers of the Company, which helped bridge cash requirements before the completion and closing of the strategic transactions described above. The Private Placement closed on November 30, 2022. 
 On January 9, 2024, the Rights Offering closed for aggregate gross proceeds of C 30.0 million and net proceeds of 21.3 million. 
 On February 4, 2024, the Company entered into a Litigation Funding Agreement with a third party for the funding of up to 4.0 million of litigation costs in respect of specific claims against Falkbuilt, Inc., Falkbuilt Ltd. and Henderson. In return, the Company has agreed to pay from any proceeds received from the settlement of such claims, a reimbursement of funded amounts plus diligence and underwriting costs, plus a multiple of such funded amount based on certain milestones. As part of this agreement, the Company is subject to a general security arrangement over its assets. 

In January 2021, we issued C 40.3 million of the January Debentures for net proceeds after costs of C 37.6 million 29.5 million).

 On February 15, 2024, the Company announced the Issuer Bid, under which the Company offered to repurchase for cancellation: (i) up to C 6,000,000 principal amount of the January Debentures at a purchase price of C 720 per C 1,000 principal amount of January Debentures; and (ii) up to C 9,000,000 principal amount of the December Debentures at a purchase price of C 600 per C 1,000 principal amount of December Debentures. Holders of Debentures who validly tendered and did not withdraw their Debentures received the applicable purchase price, plus a cash payment for all accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date on which such Debentures were taken up by the Company. The applicable purchase price was denominated in Canadian dollars and payments of amounts owed to holders of deposited Debentures, including for interest, were made in Canadian dollars.

The purchase price of each series of Debentures (excluding the cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest) represented a discount of approximately 4 to the average trading price of the applicable series of Debentures on the TSX for the 20 trading days preceding August 2, 2024. Following the Debenture Repurchase, which closed on August 2, 2024, C 16,642,000 principal amount of the January Debentures and C 15,587,000 principal amount of the December Debentures remain outstanding, and 22NW no longer held any Debentures.

In February 2021, we entered into a loan agreement governing a C 25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with the Royal Bank of Canada RBC ), as lender (the RBC Facility ). On February 9, 2023, the Company extended the RBC Facility (the Extended RBC Facility ). The Extended RBC Facility has a borrowing base of C 15 million and a one-year term. Effective October 2023, inventory was scoped out of the Borrowing Base. On February 9, 2024, the Company extended the Extended RBC Facility (the Second Extended RBC Facility ). The Second Extended RBC Facility is subject to the borrowing base calculation to a maximum of C 15 million and a one-year term. Refer to discussion in Credit Facility herein for additional information. 
 The Company has a C 5.0 million equipment leasing facility in Canada (the Canada Leasing Facility with RBC of which C 4.4 million 3.3 million) has been drawn and C 3.9 million 2.9 million) has been repaid. The Canada Leasing Facility has a seven-year term and bears interest at 4.25 . During 2023, the Company had a 14.0 million equipment leasing facility, with RBC and one of its affiliates, in the United States, of which 13.3 million was drawn and repaid (the U.S. Leasing Facility and, together with the Canada Leasing Facility, the Leasing Facilities ). In connection with the Company s decision to close the Rock Hill Facility, we settled the liability related to the U.S. Leasing Facility 7.8 million). The U.S. Leasing Facility is no longer available to be drawn on. With the settlement of this liability, we released 2.6 million of restricted cash during 2023.

Operating Activities 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by operating activities were 1.5 million compared to 1.9 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in cash flows provided by operations is due to the lower gross profit and higher operating expenses in the third quarter 2024 compared to 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by operating activities were 1.1 million compared to 4.7 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease in cash flows compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was largely related to the receipt of 7.3 million cash proceeds from government subsidies, which was not repeated in 2024. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash flows due to improved operational results in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 We invested 0.3 million and 1.0 million in property, plant and equipment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million and 1.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This expenditure consisted of 0.8 million of manufacturing upgrades and 0.2 million related to information technology. We invested 0.9 million and 1.3 million on capitalized software during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.4 million and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, we sold 1.0 million of assets classified as held for sale as a result of the closure of the Rock Hill Facility, for proceeds of 1.0 million. 

Financing Activities 
 16.3 million and 0.3 million of cash were used in financing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.6 million and 3.4 million of cash used for the same periods of 2023. The cash used in the three months ended September 30, 2024 mainly consisted of 16.2 million used in the Debenture Repurchase. The cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised mainly of 21.3 million of net proceeds received from the Rights Offering offset by a 21.3 million principal repayment of Debentures as a result of the Issuer Bid, the Debenture Repurchase and the NCIB, 0.2 million relating to employee tax payments on vesting RSUs and scheduled payments under the Leasing Facilities. 
 Credit Facility 
 On February 12, 2021, the Company entered into the RBC Facility. Under the RBC Facility, the Borrowing Base is up to a maximum of 90 of investment grade or insured accounts receivable plus 85 of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of 75 of the book value of eligible inventory and 85 of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory less any reserves for potential prior ranking claims. Interest was calculated at the Canadian or U.S. prime rate plus 30 basis points or at the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate or LIBOR plus 155 basis points. Under the RBC Facility, if the Aggregate Excess Availability , defined as the Borrowing Base less any loan advances or letters of credit or guarantee and if undrawn including unrestricted cash is less than C 5.0 million, the Company was subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio FCCR covenant of 1.10:1 on a trailing twelve-month basis. Additionally, if the FCCR was below 1.10:1 for the three immediately preceding months, the Company was required to maintain a reserve account equal to the aggregate of one year of payments on outstanding loans on the Leasing Facilities. Had an event of default occurred or the Aggregate Excess Availability been less than C 6.25 million for five consecutive business days, the Company would have entered a cash dominion period whereby the Company s bank accounts would be blocked by RBC and daily balances would set-off any borrowings and any remaining amounts made available to the Company. 
 On February 9, 2023, the Company entered into the Extended RBC Facility. The Extended RBC Facility had a maximum borrowing base of C 15 million and a one-year term. Interest was calculated as at the Canadian or U.S. prime rate plus 75 basis points or at the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate or LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Under the Extended RBC Facility, until such time that the trailing twelve-month FCCR was above 1.25 for three consecutive months, a cash balance equivalent to one-year s worth of Leasing Facilities payments would be maintained. Effective October 2023, inventory was scoped out of the Borrowing Base. 
 On February 9, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Extended RBC Facility. The maximum availability under the Second Extended RBC Facility is subject to the borrowing base calculation to a maximum of C 15 million and a one-year term. Interest is calculated as at the Canadian or U.S. prime rate plus 75 basis points or at the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate or Adjusted Term CORRA or Term SOFR plus the Term SOFR Adjustment, in each case, plus 200 basis points. At September 30, 2024, available borrowings are C 14.4 million 10.7 million) (December 31, 2023 C 13.6 million 10.3 million) of available borrowings), calculated in the same manner as the RBC Facility described above, of which no amounts have been drawn. The Second Extended RBC Facility removed the three-month FCCR covenant, which resulted in the release of 0.1 million of restricted cash during the first quarter of 2024 (the Company had 0.4 million restricted cash as at December 31, 2023). 
 The Company has a C 5.0 million equipment leasing facility in Canada (the Canada Leasing Facility of which C 4.4 million 3.3 million) has been drawn and C 3.9 million 2.9 million) has been repaid, and a 14.0 million equipment leasing facility in the United States of which 13.3 million has been drawn and repaid (the U.S. Leasing Facility and, together with the Canada Leasing Facility, the Leasing Facilities with RBC. The Canada Leasing Facility has a seven-year term and bears interest at 4.25 . 
 As part of the decision to close the Rock Hill Facility, the Company fully settled the liability related to the U.S. Leasing Facility of 7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The U.S. Leasing Facility is no longer available to be drawn on. With the settlement of this liability, 2.6 million was released from restricted cash during 2023. 
 The Company did not make any draws on the Canadian Leasing Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. 

We are restricted from paying dividends unless Payment Conditions (as defined in the Second Extended RBC Facility) are met, including having a net borrowing availability of at least C 10 million over the proceeding 30-day period, and having a trailing twelve-month fixed charge coverage ratio above 1.10:1 and certain other conditions. The Second Extended RBC Facility is currently secured by substantially all of our real property located in Canada and the United States. 
 On February 4, 2024, the Company entered into a Litigation Funding Agreement with a third party for the funding of up to 4.0 million of litigation costs in respect of specific claims against Falkbuilt, Inc., Falkbuilt Ltd. and Henderson. In return, the Company has agreed to pay from any proceeds received from the settlement of such claims, a reimbursement of funded amounts plus diligence and underwriting costs, plus a multiple of such funded amount based on certain milestones. As part of this agreement, the Company is subject to a general security arrangement over its assets.

 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFOR MATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceeding s 
 There have been no material developments in the legal proceedings previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 except as described below regarding DIRTT s litigation against Falkbuilt, Messrs. Smed and Loberg, and their associates. 
 With respect to the Utah Unfair Competition Case, Falkbuilt has refused to respond to discovery or supplement its prior discovery, and DIRTT is preparing for motion practice. While Falkbuilt also resisted the entry of a scheduling order, after motion practice and an order from the magistrate judge, the Court entered a scheduling order requiring discovery to be completed by February 2025. The Court set a pretrial conference for October 17, 2025. DIRTT has also retained two experts. Briefing on Falkbuilt s motion to stay the case and renewed motion to move the case to Canada is fully briefed. DIRTT is proceeding as though the motion will be denied. We are seeking 100 million of damages as part of the second amended complaint. 
 In the Canadian Non-Compete Case, on October 25, 2024, the Honourable Mr. Justice Poelman of the Court of King's Bench of Alberta granted a Court Order directing the Clerk of the Court to schedule an 8-week Trial on the first available dates after December 8, 2025, to determine all the issues (including damages and liability). The Clerk should schedule the exact Trial dates in the two weeks following this decision, but the Trial will be completed in the first half of 2026. Once the Trial date has been scheduled, DIRTT will withdraw its summary judgment application as the Trial will cover all of the issues in dispute between the parties. 
 Item 1A.	Ri sk Factors 
 In addition to the risk factors set forth below and other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our businesses, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our two largest shareholders, 22NW and WWT, are able to exercise voting influence over matters which may require shareholder approval due to their ownership of our common shares, and their interests may conflict with or differ from the interests of our other shareholders. In addition, the Amended and Restated SRP and the Support Agreement limit the concentration of ownership of our common shares by shareholders other than 22NW and WWT, which may make it more difficult for a shareholder to acquire the Company. 
 As of November 5, 2024, 22NW and Aron English (collectively, the 22NW Group and WWT and Shaun Noll (collectively, the WWT Group owned 29.7 and 27.6 of our outstanding common shares, respectively, together beneficially owning approximately 57.3 of our outstanding common shares. So long as the 22NW Group and WWT Group and their respective affiliates continue to directly or indirectly own a significant amount of our common shares, they will, in certain circumstances, have voting influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including amendments to our amended and restated articles of amalgamation, and approval of significant corporate transactions (barring any requirement for such shareholder to recuse itself from any such vote pursuant to applicable securities law, corporate law or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchanges). Further, Aron English and Shaun Noll, who serve as the investment manager and Managing Member of the 22NW Group and WWT Group, respectively, also serve as directors on the Company s Board of Directors. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company, and would make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these shareholders. 
 In addition, the Amended and Restated SRP, which was ratified by shareholders at the SRP Meeting held on September 20, 2024, was adopted by the Board in order to help ensure that all shareholders of the Company are treated fairly and equally in connection with any unsolicited take-over bid or other acquisition of control of the Company. The Amended and Restated SRP may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control or acquisition of the Company, even if such action may be considered beneficial by some shareholders, and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for the Company s common shares. 
 The repurchase and cancellation of our Debentures in 2024, the Debenture Repurchase and the NCIB could adversely affect the price or liquidity of the Debentures. 

On March 22, 2024, the Company completed the Issuer Bid in which the Company repurchased for cancellation C 4.7 million of the principal balance of the January Debentures and C 5.8 million of the principal balance of the December Debentures. 
 On August 2, 2024, the Company and 22NW closed the Debenture Repurchase in which the Company purchased for cancellation an aggregate of C 18,915,000 principal amount of the January Debentures and C 13,638,000 principal amount of the December Debentures. Following the Issuer Bid and Debenture Repurchase, C 16,642,000 principal amount of the January Debentures and C 15,587,000 principal amount of the December Debentures remain outstanding and 22NW no longer holds any debentures. 
 On August 26, 2024, the company announced a NCIB of the January and December debentures. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, C 0.1 million and nil principal amounts of the December Debentures and January Debentures, respectively, were acquired and cancelled. 
 The Issuer Bid, the Debenture Repurchase, and the NCIB have decreased, and the NCIB may further decrease the number of outstanding Debentures, and therefore could decrease their liquidity in the market of the Debentures and increase the volatility of the prices at which they trade. The Debenture Repurchase may also cause the prices of the Debentures to differ from what they would be in the absence of the Debenture Repurchase. There can be no assurance the Debenture Repurchase will ultimately enhance shareholder value.
