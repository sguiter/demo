The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to the impact of the geographical mix of pre-tax income and loss across tax jurisdictions relative to the Company s consolidated pre-tax income on the estimated annual effective tax rate.

million. Several jurisdictions in which we operate have either enacted, or announced plans to enact, legislation consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules ("Pillar Two") which introduced a global minimum effective tax rate of 15 applied on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We have analyzed enacted legislation and do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2024; however, we continue to monitor future tax legislative changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate in order to evaluate the impacts to the consolidated financial statements. .

Total share-based compensation expense 

Share Grants. Share grants consist of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs ). Restricted stock awards and RSUs generally vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period and are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite four-year service period. All new grants are awarded under the Company s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan. PSUs are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, and compensation expense is recognized over the three-year performance period, with adjustments made to the expense to recognize the probable payout percentage. As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to share grants was approximately million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years. Stock Modification . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we modified previously granted stock awards for two corporate officers who retired. The result of the modifications resulted in the acceleration of the vesting of stock awards for the corporate officers. The incremental expense recorded for this modification was approximately million, which was expensed in selling, general, and administrative SG A expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages, which could impact our business and operating results for the period in which the ruling occurs and future periods. Based on available information available, we evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes of all pending disputes. We record an appropriate liability when the amount of any liability associated with a pending dispute is deemed probable and reasonably estimable. In addition, we do not accrue estimated legal fees and other directly related costs as they are expensed as incurred. The Company is not currently a party to any pending litigation that we consider material.

 joint venture partner in our Shanghai assembly and test facilities. We sell products to, and purchase inventory from, companies owned by Keylink. In addition, our subsidiaries in China lease their manufacturing facilities in Shanghai from, and subcontract a portion of our manufacturing process (metal plating and environmental services) to, Keylink. We also pay a consulting fee to Keylink. Warren Chen, a member of the Company s board of directors, serves as a member of the Nuvoton board of directors. We purchase wafers from Nuvoton for use in our production process. We have an agreement to purchase approximately million of wafers from Nuvoton that ends in the fourth quarter of 2025. We consider our relationship with Nuvoton to be mutually beneficial, and plan to continue our strategic alliance with Nuvoton. JCP is a frequency control product manufacturing company from which we purchase material and in which we have made an equity investment that we account for using the equity method of accounting. Atlas is an early stage privately held fabless wafer design company in which the Company holds a majority interest. The Company determined that Atlas is a variable interest entity VIE ), and the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Atlas. The Company has therefore determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Consequently, we do not consolidate the assets and liabilities of Atlas in the Company s financial statements. For additional information related to Atlas see Note 14 - Equity Investments - Unconsolidated VIE, below.

million of investments accounted for under the measurement alternative. Unconsolidated VIE During July 2021, the Company acquired an interest in Atlas, an early stage privately held fabless wafer design company located in the western United States. The Company s initial investment in July 2021 was million of preferred stock and a million convertible promissory note. In April 2023, the Company acquired an additional interest in Atlas by purchasing million of preferred stock. The primary purpose for providing the additional investment in Atlas was for continued access to developing technology with potential future benefit to the Company. As part of the April 2023 agreement, the Company s previously held convertible note converted to million of preferred stock and at September 30, 2024, the Company owned more than of Atlas. The Company determined that Atlas is a VIE and a related party. While the Company does own more that of Atlas, according to the voting agreement governing the transaction, the Company does not have the power to control the board of directors or direct the activities that most significantly impact Atlas, including: The hiring and firing of officers (i.e., CEO, CFO, etc.) The hiring and firing of personnel responsible for making the key daily decisions and implementing the strategic operating direction will determine the success the Company has in their initiatives, thereby affecting the economic performance; Determining the business plan and budget, including incurring additional indebtedness or issuing additional equity interests As Atlas is thinly capitalized, the decisions around when and how to obtain cash will influence whether AM can continue operating; and Determining the strategic operating direction of Atlas The decisions made around the significant operating direction of Atlas will significantly impact the overall performance of the Company by determining where and how Atlas limited capital is spent without having significant revenues to keep the Company operating. As the Company is not the primary beneficiary of Atlas, the Company did not consolidate the assets and liabilities of Atlas in our financial statements and instead accounts for the investment under the measurement alternative described in ASC 321-10-35-2 using the available measurement alternative for equity securities that lack readily determinable fair value.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales exceeded expectations, increasing 9.5 with double-digit point of sales growth in Asia. Additionally, our automotive market revenue increased to 19 of product revenue reflecting the Company s ongoing content expansion and design win initiatives, even though both the automotive and industrial markets continue to undergo inventory and demand adjustments. As further evidence of the market recovery, the Company s channel inventory continues to improve, coupled with inventory dollars and inventory days decreasing sequentially.

Net sales decreased approximately 54.6 million, or 13.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, due to lower demand across all regions and all end markets, primarily in the automotive and industrial markets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, weighted-average sales price decreased 10.1 and volume decreased 3.8 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The decline in weighted-average sales price was primarily due to weaker end-user demand in the automotive and industrial markets which collectively comprised 42 and 45 of product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The table below sets forth our product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue by end-user market for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Cost of goods sold decreased approximately 16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, due to the decreased net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Average unit cost decreased approximately 3.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased approximately 24.3 when compared to the same period last year primarily due to lower net sales, caused by lower demand in all regions and all end-markets. Gross profit margin for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 33.7 and 38.5 , respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was 
 - 22 - 

primarily due to the lower average sales price related to end-market mix and secondarily from lower loadings from the overall lower demand, particularly in our wafer fabrication plants associated with foundry service agreements. 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 5.9 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.4 and 25.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. SG A decreased approximately 3.6 million as compared to the same period last year as the company reduced discretionary expenses across payroll, stock performance awards, freight, and sales commission to align with the softer demand environment. SG A, as a percentage of net sales, was 17.0 and 15.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and development expenses R D were flat. The lower levels of discretionary benefits in SG A reflect lower accruals based on the Company s 2024 performance being lower than in 2023. R D, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.6 and 8.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest income was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year. Interest expense decreased 0.4 million, or 49.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year due to lower debt levels. The change in unrealized (loss) gain on investments in 2024 compared to 2023 was to mark to market adjustments to adjust the value of the investment. 
 We recognized an income tax expense of approximately 3.6 million and 10.7 million for the three months ended September 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in income taxes for 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pretax book income.

Net sales decreased approximately 367.2 million, or 27.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, driven by lower product shipments caused by lower demand across all regions and all end markets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, weighted-average sales price decreased 19.5 and volumes decreased 9.9 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The decline in weighted-average sales price was primarily due to weaker end-user demand in the automotive

and industrial markets which collectively comprised 41 and 47 of product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Cost of goods sold decreased approximately 146.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, due to the decreased net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Average unit cost decreased approximately 9.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased approximately 40.4 when compared to the same period last year primarily due to lower net sales, caused by lower demand in all regions and all end-markets. Gross profit margin for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 33.4 and 40.8 , respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the lower average sales price related to end-market mix and secondarily from lower loadings from the overall lower demand, particularly in our wafer fabrication plants associated with foundry service agreements. 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 29.4 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.5 and 23.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. SG A decreased approximately 29.9 million as compared to the same period last year as the company reduced discretionary expenses across payroll, stock performance awards, freight, and sales commission to align with the softer demand environment. SG A, as a percentage of net sales, was 17.7 and 15.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. R D decreased approximately 1.1 million as compared to the same period last year. R D, as a percentage of net sales, was 10.4 and 7.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gain on disposal of fixed assets increased 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Also included in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.0 million related to restructuring activities undertaken by us during the period to consolidate operations. 
 Interest income increased 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year due to income earned on financial instruments to hedge our net investment risk as well as higher interest rates earned on short-term investments. Interest expense decreased 3.4 million, or 64.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year due to lower debt levels. Unrealized gain on investments decreased from 2023 due to mark-to-market adjustments on investments recorded in 2023 and not repeated in 2024. 
 We recognized an income tax expense of approximately 9.8 million and 44.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in income taxes for 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pretax book income. 
 Financial Condition 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and our credit facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from 318.5 million at December 31, 2023 to 317.1 million at September 30, 2024. This decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reflects normal operations of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, we had short-term investments totaling 7.5 million. These investments are highly liquid with maturity dates greater than three months at the date of purchase. We generally can access these investments in a relatively short time frame but in doing so we generally forfeit all earned and future interest income. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our working capital was 909.7 million and 793.9 million, respectively. We expect cash generated by our operations together with existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available borrowing under credit facilities to be sufficient to cover our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions for at least the next 12 months. 
 Our undistributed foreign earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, with limited exceptions related to earnings of certain European and Asian subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 215.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments of which approximately 93.1 million would be subject to a potential non-U.S. 
 - 24 - 

withholding tax if distributed outside the country in which the cash is currently held. The 93.1 million is held in Germany, China, Korea, and Taiwan. 
 Short-term debt 
 Our Asia subsidiaries maintain short-term credit facilities with several financial institutions through our foreign entities worldwide totaling 148.7 million. Other than two Taiwanese credit facilities that are collateralized by assets, our foreign credit lines are unsecured, uncommitted, and contain no restrictive covenants. These credit facilities bear interest at SOFR or similar indices plus a specified margin. Interest payments are due monthly on outstanding amounts under the credit lines. The unused and available credit under the various facilities as of September 30, 2024, was approximately 112.6 million, net of 35.7 million advanced under our foreign credit lines and 0.4 million of credit used for import and export guarantee. 
 Long-term debt 
 The Company maintains a long-term credit facility Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement consists of a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of 225.0 million, including a swing line sublimit equal to the lesser of 50.0 million and the Revolving Credit Facility, a letter of credit sublimit equal to the lesser of 100.0 million and the Revolving Credit Facility, and an alternative currency sublimit equal to the lesser of 40.0 million and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has the option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility and/or incur Incremental Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to 350.0 million. The Credit Agreement bears interest at Term SOFR or similar other indices plus a specified margin and matures in May 2028. There was no outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. 
 Because some of our outstanding debt is subject to variable interest rates, the recent rise in interest rates will potentially increase our overall debt service cost. If interest rates continue to rise globally, our cost of capital may increase in the future.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.6 million. Our net use of cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from net income of 40.6 million, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets of 90.8 million and share-based compensation of 16.1 million. The increases were offset by a net decrease of 104.9 million due to changes in operating asset and liability accounts, and non-cash gains and other income of 15.8 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash through the collection in accounts receivable and used cash to fund increases in inventories, particularly in finished goods, to improve our product availability in a dynamic market environment. We also used cash to decrease accounts payable and accrued liabilities as part of normal business operations. 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 242.5 million. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from net income of 205.5 million, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets of 102.7 million and share-based compensation of 23.4 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating asset and liability accounts of 65.3 million and a non-cash investment gain of 17.6 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash and cash equivalents from investing activities was 48.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of property, plant, and equipment of 53.3 million, or 5.5 of net sales. This outflow of cash to purchase property, plant and equipment was partially offset by the receipt of an insurance recovery of 4.7 million and net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments of 2.5 million. We expect capital expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 to be within our target model of 5 to 9 of net sales. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities was 129.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to purchases of property, plant and equipment of 123.5 million, or 9.2 of net sales, due to the expansion of a wafer fabrication facility located in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan and the additional investment of 13.9 million in a privately held wafer design company. 
 - 25 - 

Financing Activities 
 Net cash and cash equivalents from financing activities was 15.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 3.8 million of net decreases in our debt and taxes paid on net share settlements of 9.5 million. Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities was 150.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of 130.4 million of net reductions in our debt and taxes paid on net share settlements of 15.6 million. 
 Use of Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
 We use interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and cross currency swaps to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure. 
 Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps, including interest rate collars, as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
 Hedges of Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against our different functional currencies. We use foreign currency forward agreements to manage this exposure and to preserve the economic value of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These instruments are not designated for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with ASC No. 815. The fair value of our foreign exchange hedges approximates zero. 
 Hedges of Net Investment Risk 
 We make use of cross-currency swaps and foreign-currency forward contracts to decrease the foreign exchange risk inherent in our investment in some of our foreign subsidiaries. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources. We have no special purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support, nor do we engage in leasing, swap agreements, or outsourcing of research and development services that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of our financial statements. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes in our Contractual Obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting estimates are described in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024. Any new accounting estimates or updates to existing accounting estimates as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been discussed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in Note 1 Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies. The application of our critical accounting estimates may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Significant Risks and Uncertainties That may affect Forward-Looking Statements 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 The impact of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Shanghai, China experienced government-imposed lockdowns due to a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus. 
 During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end-market demand could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Delays in initiation of production at facilities due to implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. 
 Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time. A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our net sales, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters and other extraordinary events, which could prevent us from producing enough of our products to maintain our sales and satisfy our customers demands and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 New technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which would adversely affect our net sales, market share, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights, and a negative impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. 
 A significant part of our growth strategy involves acquiring companies and businesses. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may incur additional costs and face emerging risks associated with environmental, social, and governance ESG factors impacting our operations. 
 Our products, or products we purchase from third parties for resale, may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty claims and product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have recourse against our suppliers, which may harm our business, reputation with our customers, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance, and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may not be able to achieve future growth, and any such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 - 28 - 

If our direct sales customers or our distributors customers do not design our products into their applications, our net sales may be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates or foreign exchange exposure or our counterparties might not perform as agreed. 
 We may have a significant amount of debt with various financial institutions worldwide. Any indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and our ability to meet payment obligations under such debt. 
 Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our business and financial activities, including our ability to obtain additional capital in the future. 
 Our business benefits from certain Chinese government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 We operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 Certain of our employees in the U.K. participate in a company-sponsored defined benefit plan which subjects the Company to risks associated with the estimates and assumptions used in calculating expense and funding requirements recorded in the Company s consolidated financial statements. Inaccuracies or changes in these estimates could require material changes in the expense and funding required. 
 Compliance with government regulations and customer demands regarding the use of conflict minerals may result in increased costs and may have a negative impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 Risks Related to our International Operations 
 Our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. 
 A slowdown in the Chinese economy could limit the growth in demand for electronic devices containing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects. 
 Economic regulation in China could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and prospects. 
 We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. s Bribery Act 2010, China s anti-corruption campaign and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. 
 We are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. 
 China is experiencing rapid social, political, and economic change, which has increased labor costs and other related costs that could make doing business in China less advantageous than in prior years. Increased labor costs in China could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in Asia, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. 
 The distribution of any earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries may be subject to foreign income taxes, thus reducing our net income. 
 We could be adversely affected by the compromise or theft of our technology, know-how, data, or intellectual property or a requirement that we yield rights in technology, know-how, data stored in foreign jurisdictions, or intellectual property that we use in such foreign jurisdictions. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 Variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. 
 We may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. 
 Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may hinder a take-over attempt. 
 
 - 29 - 

General Risks 
 The invasion of Ukraine by Russia could negatively impact our business. 
 The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems, which could adversely affect our cash flows, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may affect the markets in which our Common Stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our operating results, and financial condition. 
 System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks, and other related cybersecurity issues could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected net sales, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price. 
 I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer, Keh-Shew Lu, and Chief Financial Officer, Brett R. Whitmire, with the participation of our management, carried out an evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer believe that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be included in this Quarterly Report is: 
 recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Commission s rules and forms; and 

accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions on required disclosure. 

Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity s disclosure objectives. The likelihood of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include the fact that human judgment in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures such as simple errors, mistakes, or intentional circumvention of the established processes. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, known to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, that occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

P ART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The Company is not a party to any pending litigation that we consider material. 
 From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. While we intend to defend any lawsuit vigorously, we presently believe that the ultimate outcome of any pending legal proceeding will not have any material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or operating results. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages, which could impact our business and operating results for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2024.

 PLEASE NOTE: It is inappropriate for investors to assume the accuracy of any covenants, representations or warranties that may be contained in agreements or other documents filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In certain instances the disclosure schedules to such agreements or documents contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants. Moreover, some of the representations and warranties may not be complete or accurate as of a particular date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that is different from those generally applicable to stockholders and/or were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing certain matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts at the time they were made or otherwise.
