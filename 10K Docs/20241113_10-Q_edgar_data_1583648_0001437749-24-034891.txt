Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties, principally in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding future events, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2024, or the Merger Agreement, by and between the Pieris, Polo Merger Sub, a Delaware corporate and wholly owned subsidiary of ours, or Merger Sub, and Palvella Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Palvella, the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of our common stock in connection with, and the change of control that would be occasioned by, the Merger and the PIPE Financing, the closing of the Merger, including the timing of the Merger, and the approval of the proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of common for issuance under our charter, our cash balance at the closing of the Merger, if any, our ability to receive future milestones and royalty payments in connection with the contingent value rights contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our workforce reduction and related restructuring activities, our future financial and operating performance, anticipated timing and amounts of milestone and other payments under collaboration agreements, business strategy and plans, objectives of management for future operations, timing and outcome of legal and other proceedings and our ability to finance our operations are forward-looking statements. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using terms such as including anticipates, approach, believes, can, contemplate, continue, look forward, ongoing, could, estimates, expects, intends, may, appears, suggests, future, likely, goal, plans, potential, possibly, projects, predicts, seek, should, target, would or will and other similar words or expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. 

These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks outlined under Risk Factors or elsewhere in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements to differ materially.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we address the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements du e to a number of factors, including, without limitation, risks related to: consummating the Merger Agreement and realizing the anticipated benefits in connection with the proposed merger; our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and capital preservation as a result of our workforce reduction and related restructuring; the early stage of our partnered drug candidates presently under development; our partners' continued progress, if any, in the areas of co-stimulatory bispecifics and the results of their research and development activities including uncertainties relating to the ongoing or planned clinical testing of our partnered product candidates; our potential need for substantial additional funds in order to continue our operations and the uncertainty of whether we will be able to obtain the funding we need; our ability to maintain our compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market LLC, or Nasdaq; the possibility that Nasdaq treats us as a public shell, which may lead to delisting of our common stock on Nasdaq; our future financial performance; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business, including patent and other intellectual property rights; the success of our collaborations with third parties; our partners ability to meet milestones; the receipt of royalty and milestone payments provided for in our collaboration agreements; our partners' ability to successfully market and sell our drug candidates in the future as needed; the size and growth of the potential markets for any of our product candidates for which we or our partners may obtain regulatory approval, and the rate and degree of market acceptance of such product candidates; competition in our industry; regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries, including with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; Pfizer Inc.'s, or Pfizer s, ability to continue to advance SGN-BB228 (also known as PRS-346) and the other drug candidates licensed to them; BP Asset XII, Inc.'s, or Boston Pharmaceuticals', ability to continue to advance BOS-342 (also known as PRS-342); the expected impact of new accounting standards; and the delays or disruptions due to geopolitical issues, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East on our company. 

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement(s), each of which applies only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 15, 2024 and August 14, 2024 for the quarters ending March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, or Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 29, 2024, could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform our statements to actual results or changed expectations.

PIERIS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. 
 NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 

interest in Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH (formerly Pieris AG, a German company which was founded in 2001 in December 2014. Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively Pieris, or the Company, is a biopharmaceutical company that, prior to July of 2023, discovered and developed Anticalin-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in unique and transformative ways. Pieris clinical pipeline consists of immuno-oncology, or IO, programs partnered with several major multi-national pharmaceutical companies. Pieris' corporate headquarters is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Pieris also maintains office space in Ismaning, Germany. The Company s core Anticalin technology and platform was developed in Germany. 
 On July 18, 2023 , the Company announced its intention to explore engaging in one or more strategic transactions, including mergers, reverse mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or sales of assets, or other strategic transactions. This decision was related to events that impacted the Company s inhaled respiratory franchise in connection with AstraZeneca's discontinuation of enrollment of the Phase 2a study for elarekibep, an inhaled IL- 4R antagonist Anticalin protein to treat uncontrolled asthma. As part of this initiative, the Company engaged Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated to serve as its advisor in its review of strategic transactions. 
 
 Also on July 18, 2023 , the Company s Board of Directors approved a reduction in the Company s workforce by approximately . Since July of 2023, and continuing through September 30, 2024 , the Company took additional steps to reduce its operating footprint including terminating its remaining lease obligations in Germany and winding down its proprietary inhaled respiratory programs. The Company also has opted out and terminated programs where possible to reduce operating costs. Further reductions in the workforce have occurred based upon these actions. As a result, the Company has incurred approximately million of severance costs and other related termination benefits in 2023 as the service period to earn such benefits is considered complete. 
 
 Approximately million of the termination benefits were paid in 2023. The Company expects approximately million of the termination benefits to be paid through the end of 2024, with the remainder of termination benefits to be paid in 2025. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, the Company announced the implementation of a new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend its cash runway into at least 2027, while maximizing its ability to capture the potential milestones from its partnered 4 - 1BB bispecific Mabcalin protein IO assets. The Company may be entitled to aggregate milestones of up to approximately million upon first patient dosed in the Phase 2 trials for SGN- BB228 and BOS- 342, which are currently in Phase 1 clinical development, and up to approximately million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN- BB228 and BOS- 342. 
 
 On July 23, 2024, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Polo Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Palvella Therapeutics, Inc., or Palvella, discussed further in Note 11, whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Palvella, with Palvella continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation of the merger, or the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) each then-outstanding share of Palvella capital stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio as defined in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) each then-outstanding Palvella stock option to purchase Palvella common stock will be assumed by the Company. Each of the Company and Palvella has agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants relating to 1 using reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of their respective stockholders, 2 non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, 3 the conduct of their respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, 4 the Company using its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the existing listing of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq and the Company causing the shares of the Company's common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq prior to the closing of the Merger and 5 the Company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and causing to become effective a registration statement to register the shares of the Company's common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger. 
 
 On August 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Subscription and Investment Representation Agreement with James Geraghty, Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors, or the Purchaser, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell one 1 share of the Company s Series F Preferred Stock, par value per share, to the Purchaser for cash. The sale closed on August 7, 2024. The Series F Preferred Stock have no voting rights other than the right to vote on a proposed amendm ent to the Company s amended and restated articles of incorporation to effect an increase in the number of authorized shares of the Company s common stock, or the Authorized Share Increase Proposal . Each share of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding on the record date entitles the holder thereof to votes on the Authorized Share Increase Proposal, and all shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holder must and will be voted, without further action by such holder, in the same proportion as the aggregate shares of Pieris common stock (excluding any shares of Pieris common stock that are not voted) that are voted on the Authorized Share Increase Proposal . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , cash and cash equivalents were million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company had a net loss of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company had net losses of million and million, respectively. The Company has incurred net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024 . Net losses and negative cash flows from operations have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company s stockholders equity and working capital. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 The Company has historically devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expenses to support the discovery and development of Anticalin-based drugs. Going forward, as part of the Company's previous decision to implement measures to maximize its ability to capture potential milestones from its partnered programs with Pfizer and Boston Pharmaceuticals (all as defined in Note 3 below) and the Company's plan to consummate the potential Merger, subject to stockholder approval, the Company has discontinued all research and development efforts and continues to reduce discretionary expenditures and other fixed or variable personnel costs. The Company believes that its currently available funds will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q. The Company's belief with respect to its ability to fund operations is based on estimates that are subject to risks and uncertainties. 

reverse stock split of its common stock, or the Reverse Split, with any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Split rounded up to the next whole share of common stock. All references to shares of common stock outstanding, average number of shares outstanding and per share amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q have been restated to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis. 
 The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used for, but are not limited to, revenue recognition; deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances; beneficial conversion features; fair value of stock options, preferred stock, and warrants; fair value of assets held for sale; and prepaid and accrued clinical trial expenses. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially from management s estimates, judgments and assumptions. 

Licensing arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the promised goods or services, which often include licenses, research and development services and governance committee services, are distinct or whether they must be accounted for as part of a combined performance obligation. If the license is considered not to be distinct, the license would then be combined with other promised goods or services as a combined performance obligation. If the Company is involved in a governance committee, it assesses whether its involvement constitutes a separate performance obligation. When governance committee services are determined to be separate performance obligations, the Company determines the fair value to be allocated to this promised service. Certain contracts contain optional and additional items, which are considered marketing offers and are accounted for as separate contracts with the customer if such option is elected by the customer, unless the option provides a material right which would not be provided without entering into the contract. An option that is considered a material right is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. A contract may contain variable consideration, including potential payments for both milestone and research and development services. For certain potential milestone payments, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration by using the most likely amount method. In making this assessment, the Company evaluates factors such as the clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone. Each reporting period the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such variable consideration and any related constraints. The Company will include variable consideration, without constraint, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. For potential research and development service payments, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method, including any approved budget updates arising from additional research or development services. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis unless a portion of the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price of the underlying performance obligations or, in the case of certain variable consideration, to one or more performance obligations. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs to complete the respective performance obligation. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amount the Company would expect to receive for each performance obligation. When a performance obligation is satisfied, revenue is recognized for the amount of the transaction price, excluding estimates of variable consideration that are constrained, that is allocated to that performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement. For performance obligations consisting of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. If the license to the Company s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. Revenue recognized under an arrangement involving a participant that is a customer is presented as Customer Revenue. Milestones and Royalties The Company aggregates milestones into four categories: (i) research milestones, (ii) development milestones, (iii) commercial milestones, and (iv) sales milestones. Research milestones are typically achieved upon reaching certain success criteria as defined in each agreement related to developing an Anticalin protein against the specified target. Development milestones are typically reached when a compound reaches a defined phase of clinical research or passes such phase, or upon gaining regulatory approvals. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches the status for commercial sale, including regulatory approval. Sales milestones are certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount. There is uncertainty that the events to obtain the research and development milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the Company s technology. The Company has thus determined that all research and development milestones will be constrained until it is deemed probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. For revenues from research and development milestones, payments will be recognized consistent with the recognition pattern of the performance obligation to which they relate. 
 For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Commercial milestones and sales royalties are determined by sales or usage-based thresholds and will be accounted for under the royalty recognition constraint as constrained variable consideration. The Company calculates the maximum amount of potential milestones achievable under each collaboration agreement and discloses such potential future milestones for all current collaborations using such a maximum calculation. Contract Balances The Company recognizes a contract asset when the Company transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, excluding any amounts presented as a receivable (i.e., accounts receivable). A contract asset is an entity s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. The contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) primarily relate to contracts where the Company has received payment but has not yet satisfied the related performance obligations. In the event of an early termination of a collaboration agreement, any contract liabilities would be recognized in the period in which all Company obligations under the agreement have been fulfilled. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract with a Customer Certain costs to obtain customer contracts, including success-based fees paid to third -party service providers, and costs to fulfill customer contracts are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs , or ASC 340. These costs are amortized to expense on a systemic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The Company will expense the amortization of costs to obtain customer contracts to general and administrative expense and costs to fulfill customer contracts to research and development expense.

Strategic Partnerships 
 
 Genentech 
 
 On May 19, 2021, the Company and Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Genentech Agreement, to discover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies that leverage the Company s proprietary Anticalin technology. Upon signing the Genentech Agreement, Genentech paid the Company a million upfront fee. 
 
 Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, the Company was responsible for discovery and preclinical development of two initial programs. In April and May 2023, Genentech and the Company decided to discontinue the discovery-stage programs in ophthalmology and respiratory, respectively, for scientific reasons. Pursuant to this decision, the material right performance obligations related to the target swaps for these programs also expired. Based on these decisions, there are no more active performance obligations remaining under the collaboration and the Company recognized all remaining revenue, or 12.5 million, under the collaboration in the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

Genentech also had options to select additional programs with the payment of a fee, which expired in May 2024. With the expiration of these options and no programs active or ongoing, the Genentech Agreement also expired. 
 
 Boston Pharmaceuticals 
 
 On April 24, 2021, the Company and BP Asset XII, Inc., or Boston Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Boston Pharma Holdings, LLC, entered into an Exclusive Product License Agreement, or the BP Agreement, to develop BOS- 342, also referred to as PRS- 342, a 4 - 1BB/GPC3 preclinical immuno-oncology Mabcalin (antibody-Anticalin fusion) protein. 
 
 Under the terms of the BP Agreement, Boston Pharmaceuticals exclusively licensed worldwide rights to BOS- 342. The Company received an upfront payment and is further entitled to receive development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, tiered royalties up to low double-digits on sales of BOS- 342 and a percentage of consideration received by Boston Pharmaceuticals in the event of a sublicense of a program licensed under the BP Agreement or a change of control of Boston Pharmaceuticals. 
 
 The Company recognized the full transaction price as revenue in 2021 and has no remaining obligations. In August 2023, the first patient was dosed in the Boston Pharmaceuticals sponsored Phase 1/2 study of PRS- 342/BOS - 342 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which the Company received a milestone payment of million. 
 
 Pfizer (formerly Seagen) 
 
 On February 8, 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform technology license agreement, or the Pfizer Platform License, and together with the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the Pfizer Agreements, with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, pursuant to which the parties agreed to develop multiple targeted bispecific IO treatments for solid tumors and blood cancers. 
 
 Under the terms of the Pfizer Agreements, the companies agreed to pursue multiple antibody-Anticalin fusion proteins during the research phase. The Pfizer Agreements provide Pfizer an option to select up to programs for further development, which Pfizer did, and Pfizer is responsible for developing, funding and commercializing each of these programs. 
 
 On March 24, 2021, the Company entered into a Second Pfizer Amendment (formerly the Second Seagen Amendment), to amend the existing immuno-oncology collaboration agreement relating to joint development and commercial rights for one program in the alliance. Under the Second Pfizer Amendment, the Company retains a co-promotion option in the United States for one program, while Pfizer remains solely responsible for the development and overall commercialization of that program. The Company will also be entitled to increased royalties from that program if it chooses to exercise the co-promotion option. 
 
 Under the Pfizer Agreements, the Company is eligible to receive other various research, development, commercial and sales milestones. There is uncertainty that the events to obtain the research and development milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the Company s technology. The Company has thus determined that all research and development milestones will be constrained until it is deemed probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur, with the exception of the million milestone as described in the following paragraph. 
 
 In January 2023, the Company achieved a milestone for the first program in the Pfizer collaboration for million. The Company evaluated the recognition of the milestone under ASC 606 and concluded that the constraints on the milestone no longer existed as of December 31, 2022 and therefore recorded the full million as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 In September 2023, Pfizer and the Company entered into an amendment of the Second Pfizer Amendment that provides Pfizer with collaboration product licenses and no changes to the amounts achievable under the collaboration agreement. The effect of the September 2023 amendment was to transfer responsibility for substantially all activities previously performed by the Company to Pfizer. Subsequently, in December 2023, the transfer of the programs was fully approved by the combined joint steering committee. Accordingly, the Company recognized revenue of approximately million for the delivery on its performance obligations related to the two programs for the year ended December 31, 2023 . With this amendment, the Company has satisfied all remaining obligations under the collaboration. 
 
 AstraZeneca 
 
 On May 2, 2017, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform technology license agreement, or AstraZeneca Platform License, and together with the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, the AstraZeneca Agreements, with AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, which became effective on June 10, 2017, following expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. 

In addition to elarekibep (formerly known as PRS- 060/AZD1402 ), or the AstraZeneca Lead Product, the Company and AstraZeneca agreed to collaborate, under the original terms of the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, to progress additional novel Anticalin proteins against undisclosed targets for respiratory diseases, or the AstraZeneca Collaboration Products, and together with the AstraZeneca Lead Product, the AstraZeneca Products. The first discovery-stage programs were discontinued in 2022. The third discovery-stage program was discontinued in the second quarter of 2023, which led to recognition of million of revenue in that same quarter. 
 
 In June 2023, based on non-clinical safety findings in a 13 -week toxicology study of elarekibep in non-human primates previously disclosed by the Company, AstraZeneca notified us of its decision to discontinue and cease dosing in the ongoing clinical studies of elarekibep. There was no effect to revenue as a result of the discontinuation of this program. 
 
 On July 17, 2023, as a result of the non-clinical safety finding in the 13 -week toxicology study of elarekibep in non-human primates, AstraZeneca notified the Company of its intention to terminate the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement and the AstraZeneca Platform License, effective October 15, 2023. As a result of this, the remaining amount of current deferred revenue, or million, related to the fourth discovery-stage program was recognized in revenue in the third quarter of 2023. With the termination of the AstraZeneca Agreements, there are no more active programs or performance obligations related to the collaboration. Following the termination date, the Company determined that it would not continue development of the programs under the AstraZeneca Agreements. 
 
 Servier 
 
 In 2017, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or Servier Collaboration Agreement, and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform license agreement, or Servier Platform License Agreement, and together with the Servier Collaboration Agreement, the Servier Agreements, with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, or Servier, pursuant to which the Company and Servier agreed to initially pursue bispecific therapeutic programs. The intention of the collaboration and defined programs was to combine antibodies from the Servier portfolio with or more Anticalin proteins based on the Company s proprietary platform to generate innovative IO bispecific drug candidates. 
 
 Since inception, four of the initially committed programs have been discontinued by Servier. The Company does not presently intend to continue development of the four discontinued programs but retains full rights to advance the development and commercialization of those products on a world-wide basis in the future. 

In
 July 2023, the Company notified Servier of its decision to opt out of co-development and commercialization of
 S095012, also referred to as PRS-
 344, a
 4 -
 1BB/PD -
 L1 bispecific Mabcalin protein, in the United States. With the decision to opt out of co-development of
 S095012, the Company recognized the remaining revenue under the collaboration, or
 million, in
 2023 and there are
 no more active co-development programs under the collaboration.

On June 28, 2024, Servier provided the Company with a written notice of termination of the Servier Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Servier Platform License Agreement, the Servier Platform License Agreement terminates upon termination of the Servier Collaboration Agreement. The Servier Collaboration Agreement and Servier Platform License Agreements will terminate effective December 27, 2024, or 180 days from the date on which Servier notified the Company of its intent to terminate both agreements. 
 
 With this notice, Servier will discontinue and cease dosing in the Phase 1 clinical study of S095012. Servier's decision to terminate both agreements was based on a potential safety concern in S095012 Phase 1 clinical studies. The Company does not intend to pursue any further development of S095012. 

Contract Balances 

The Company receives payments from its collaboration partners based on payments established in each contract. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due until such time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations under each arrangement. A contract asset is a conditional right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company s right is unconditional. 
 
 There were no additions to deferred revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . There were no reductions to deferred revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and reductions to deferred revenue were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. The Company validates the prices provided by its third -party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources, as needed. After completing its validation procedures, the Company did not adjust any fair value measurements provided by the pricing services as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The Company recorded no realized gains or losses from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded no realized gains or losses and 0.1 million in realized losses from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 

Office furniture and equipment 
 Assets held for sale 

At the end of the third quarter of 2023, as part of the Company's strategic process for maximizing the value of assets, the Company committed to a plan to prepare and sell all property and equipment held at the Hallbergmoos, Germany location. The sale of the assets was deemed probable as a result of management's decision, including the estimated timing of sale which was determined to be within a year of the decision. As a result of this decision, the property and equipment met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting. 
 
 The net book value of its long-lived assets, as of December 31, 2023 represents the Company's best estimate of the fair value less costs to sell that could be recovered related to lab and office equipment and furniture as part of the Company's initiative to monetize all remaining assets. As the estimated selling price less costs to sell are based primarily on unobservable inputs as they relate to the location and condition of the specific lab equipment and furniture, they are classified in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company conducted an auction, with the assistance of a third party, of its assets held for sale. After the conclusion of the auction, the Company recovered the total net book value of the assets held for sale and recorded a gain on the sale of the assets of 0.2 million within "Other income (loss)" in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

million, and a valuation for Pieris equal to million, provided, that (a) if Pieris net cash as of the closing is greater than million, then Pieris valuation will be adjusted upwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) Pieris' net cash, minus (ii) million, and (b) if Pieris net cash is less than million, then Pieris valuation will be adjusted downwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) million, minus (ii) Pieris net cash. 
 
 For the purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio for each of Pieris and Palvella, the total number of shares of capital stock of such company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, expressed on a fully-diluted and as-converted to common stock basis, calculated using the treasury stock method, will be included in the calculation of the Exchange Ratio. Shares of Pieris common stock underlying Pieris stock options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share of less than the volume weighted average closing trading price of a share of Pieris common stock on the Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending five trading days immediately prior to the date upon which the Merger occurs will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, and all shares of Palvella common stock underlying outstanding Palvella stock options, warrants and other derivative securities will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, on a pro forma basis, it is expected that upon the closing of the Merger, pre-Merger Company stockholders will own approximately of the combined company and pre-Merger Palvella stockholders will own approximately of the combined company, based on the number of shares of the Company's common stock expected to be issued in connection with the Merger, in each case, prior to the issuance of shares under a proposed concurrent private financing.

Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive payments upon the receipt of payments by Pieris or any of its affiliates under certain strategic partner agreements, including existing collaboration agreements pursuant to which Pieris may be entitled to milestones and royalties in the future and other out-licensing agreements for certain of Pieris legacy assets, and upon the receipt of certain research and development tax credits in favor of Pieris or any of its affiliates, in each case as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the CVR Agreement. 
 
 The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. In the event that no such proceeds are received, holders of the CVRs will not receive any payment pursuant to the CVR Agreement. There can be no assurance that holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only and will not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the CVR Agreement. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or any other instrument and will not be registered with the SEC. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Pieris or any of its affiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs. 
 
 Termination Fees 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of each of Pieris and Palvella, including, subject to compliance with the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement, the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Pieris may be required to pay Palvella a termination fee of million and Palvella may be required to pay Pieris a termination fee of million. 
 
 Securities Purchase Agreement 
 
 On July 23, 2024, and in connection with the executed Merger Agreement, Pieris entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with certain investors, including BVF Partners, L.P., an existing stockholder of Pieris, or the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase (either for cash or in exchange for the termination and cancellation of outstanding convertible notes issued by Palvella), and Pieris agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of approximately of shares of Pieris common stock at a price per share equal to multiplied by x divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, or the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and/or in lieu of Pieris common stock to certain purchasers who so choose, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase up to shares of Pieris common stock at a purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant equal to the Purchase Price minus , subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, or the PIPE Financing. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Pieris, on the one hand, and the PIPE Investors, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Merger. The gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing are expected to be approximately million, before paying estimated expenses. The closing of the PIPE Financing is expected to occur in connection with and immediately following the consummation of the Merger. 
 
 The Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire, and each Pre-Funded Warrant will be exercisable at any time after the date of issuance of such Pre-Funded Warrant, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation. A holder of a Pre-Funded Warrant may not exercise such Pre-Funded Warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than or of the number of shares of Pieris common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, provided, however, that a holder may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation by giving 61 days notice to the Company, but not to any percentage in excess of . 
 
 At or prior to the closing of the PIPE Financing, Pieris will enter into a registration rights agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, with the PIPE Investors pursuant to which the PIPE Investors will be entitled to certain resale registration rights with respect to shares of Pieris common stock issued to the PIPE Investors and any shares of Pieris common stock issued upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be required to prepare and file a resale registration statement with the SEC within 30 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause this registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 90 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing (or within 120 days following the PIPE Financing if the SEC reviews the registration statement).

 Overview 
 
 We are a biotechnology company that historically discovered and developed Anticalin protein-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in unique and transformative ways. Proprietary to us, Anticalin proteins are a novel class of therapeutics validated in the clinic and through partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer (formerly Seagen), and Boston Pharmaceuticals in immuno-oncology, or IO. Our clinical pipeline consists of IO bispecifics in partnership with collaborators including SGN-BB228 (also referred to as PRS-346) targeting CD228 and 4-1BB, and BOS-342 (also referred to as PRS-342) targeting GPC3 and 4-1BB. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, we announced the implementation of a new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend its cash runway into at least 2027, while maximizing its ability to capture the potential milestones from its partnered 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin protein IO assets. We may be entitled to aggregate milestones of up to approximately 15.0 million upon first patient dosed in the Phase 2 trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342, which are currently in Phase 1 clinical development, and up to approximately 40.0 million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342. 
 
 On July 23, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub and Palvella pursuant to which, among other matters, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Palvella, with Palvella continuing as our wholly owned subsidiary and the surviving corporation of the merger, or Merger. If the Merger is completed, the business of Palvella will continue as the business of the combined organization. 

We expect to devote significant time and resources to the completion of the Merger. However, there can be no assurances that such activities will result in completion of the Merger. Further, the completion of the Merger may ultimately not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value. If the Merger is not completed, we will reconsider our strategic alternatives. We consider one of the following courses of actions to be the most likely alternatives if the Merger is not completed:

Continue to operate its business : On March 27, 2024, we announced our decision to implement measures that are expected to extend our cash runway into at least 2027, while maximizing our ability to collect potential milestones from our clinical pipeline of partnered drug candidates. If the Merger is not completed, our Board may elect to continue with this strategy and continue to operate our business.

Pursue another strategic transaction similar to the Merger . We may resume our process of evaluating other companies interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with us and, if a candidate is identified, focus our attention on negotiating and completing such a transaction with such candidate. 
 
 Dissolve and liquidate our assets . If for any reason the Merger does not close, our Board may conclude that it is in the best interest of stockholders to dissolve the Company and liquidate our assets. In that event, we would be required to pay any contractual obligations, wind down any remaining operations, and set aside certain reserves for potential future claims. There would be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash remaining to distribute to stockholders after paying our obligations and setting aside funds for reserves. 
 
 Merger Agreement 
 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding share of Palvella capital stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio as defined in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) each then-outstanding Palvella stock option to purchase Palvella common stock will be assumed by us, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement. In connection with the Merger, and contingent on the approval of our stockholders, we intend to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock, change our corporate name to Palvella Therapeutics, Inc. and adopt a new 2024 equity incentive plan. The provisions for calculating the Exchange Ratio are set forth in the Merger Agreement, and assume a valuation for Palvella equal to 95 million, and a valuation for us equal to 21 million, provided, that (a) our net cash as of the closing is greater than 11 million, then our valuation will be adjusted upwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) our net cash, minus (ii) 11 million, and (b) if our net cash is less than 11 million, then Pieris valuation will be adjusted downwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) 11 million, minus (ii) our net cash. 
 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of, and the calculation of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to, the Merger Agreement, it is currently anticipated that upon the closing of the Merger, our pre-Merger stockholders will own approximately 18 of the combined company and pre-Merger Palvella stockholders will own approximately 82 of the combined company on a pro forma basis, based on the number of shares of our common stock expected to be issued in connection with the Merger. The shares of the combined company purchased by the PIPE Investors in the PIPE Financing (as such terms are defined below) are not reflected in the foregoing percentages. 
 
 The provisions for calculating the Exchange Ratio are set forth in the Merger Agreement and assume a valuation for Palvella equal to 95.0 million and a valuation for our company equal to 21.0 million, subject to adjustment based on our net cash as of the date immediately preceding the anticipated closing date, as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Exchange Ratio is also based on the relative capitalizations of us and Palvella, as further described in the Merger Agreement. For purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio, for each of us and Palvella, the total number of shares of capital stock of such company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, expressed on a fully-diluted and as-converted to common stock basis, calculated using the treasury stock method, will be included in the calculation of the Exchange Ratio. Shares of our common stock underlying our stock options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share of less than the volume weighted average closing trading price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, for the five consecutive trading days ending five trading days immediately prior to the date upon which the Merger occurs will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, and all shares of Palvella common stock underlying outstanding Palvella stock options, warrants and other derivative securities will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
 
 In connection with the Merger, we will seek the approval or ratification, as applicable, by our stockholders of, among other things, (a) the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable in connection with the Merger under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (b) amendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation to (i) increase the number of shares of authorized common stock and (ii) change the name of our company to Palvella Therapeutics, Inc. (the approvals described in clause (a) and (b), the Required Pieris Voting Proposals and (c) the adoption of a new 2024 equity incentive plan, in each case, as described in the Merger Agreement. 
 
 We and Palvella have each agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) using reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of their respective stockholders, (2) non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, (3) the conduct of their respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (4) using our commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the existing listing of our common stock on Nasdaq and us causing the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq prior to the closing of the Merger and (5) us filing with the SEC and causing to become effective a registration statement to register the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, or the Registration Statement. 
 
 Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, (1) approval by our stockholders of the Required Pieris Voting Proposals, (2) approval by the Palvella stockholders of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (3) Nasdaq s approval of the listing of the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and (5) the consummation of the PIPE Financing (as defined below), all in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement (as defined below). Each party s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to other specified customary conditions, including the representations and warranties of the other party being true and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the Merger, generally subject to an overall material adverse effect qualification, the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the date of the closing of the Merger and the absence of any material adverse effect affecting the other party that is continuing on the closing date. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of each of us and Palvella, including, subject to compliance with the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement, the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Palvella a termination fee of 1.0 million and Palvella may be required to pay us a termination fee of 2.0 million. 

At the Effective Time, the board of directors of the combined company is expected to consist of five members, four of whom will be designated by Palvella and one of whom will be designated by us. Palvella s designees are expected to be Wes Kaupinen, Todd Davis, George Jenkins and Tadd Wessel. Our designee is expected to be Christopher Kiritsy, a current member of our board of directors.

At or prior to the Effective Time, we will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement, or the CVR Agreement, with a rights agent, pursuant to which our pre-Merger capital stockholders will receive one contingent value right, or a CVR, for each outstanding share of our common stock held by such stockholder, or share of common stock underlying preferred stock held by such stockholder, on such date. Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive payments upon the receipt of payments by us or any of our affiliates under certain strategic partner agreements, including existing collaboration agreements pursuant to which we may be entitled to milestones and royalties in the future and other out-licensing agreements for certain of our legacy assets, and upon the receipt of certain research and development tax credits in favor of us or any of our affiliates, in each case as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the CVR Agreement.

Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive cash payments (net of certain expenses and taxes) upon the receipt of payments by us or any of our affiliates under certain strategic partner agreements, including existing collaboration agreements pursuant to which we may be entitled to milestones and royalties in the future and other out-licensing agreements for certain of our legacy assets, and upon the receipt of certain research and development tax credits in favor of us or any of our affiliates, in each case as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the CVR Agreement. We retain the ability under the Merger Agreement to seek to enter into such agreements related to our legacy assets and intellectual property, including PRS-400 and PRS-220, though we currently do not have any such agreements in place and do not have any plans to divest any material assets. We continue to explore potential transactions for PRS-400 and PRS-220. Our management has determined that there is no value associated with the CVRs as the likelihood of any payments received in connection with our legacy assets is remote. Unless earlier terminated by the representative of the CVR holders and the combined company, the CVR Agreement will terminate on the date on which no strategic partner agreement is in effect and no payments are payable to us or any of our affiliates under any strategic partner agreement.

The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. In the event that no such proceeds are received, holders of the CVRs will not receive any payment pursuant to the CVR Agreement. There can be no assurance that holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only and will not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the CVR Agreement. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or any other instrument and will not be registered with the SEC. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in us or any of our affiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs. 
 
 The proposed merger transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 and remains subject to stockholder approval. 
 
 Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with certain investors, including BVF Partners, L.P., an existing stockholder of Pieris, or the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase (either for cash or in exchange for the termination and cancellation of outstanding convertible notes issued by Palvella), and we agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of up to 3,154,241 of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to 13.7299 multiplied by (x) 0.315478 divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, or the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and/or in lieu of our common stock to certain purchasers who so choose, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase up to 2,592,585 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant equal to the Purchase Price minus 0.001, or the PIPE Financing. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of ours, on the one hand, and the PIPE Investors, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Merger. The gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing are expected to be approximately 78.9 million, before paying estimated expenses. The closing of the PIPE Financing is expected to occur in connection with and immediately following the consummation of the Merger. 

Discovery and Development Programs 
 
 We currently have several IO drug candidates partnered with major biopharmaceutical companies, which are at varying stages of development: 

Our IO partnered portfolio includes the following drug candidates that are multi-specific Anticalin-based fusion protein drug candidates designed to engage immunomodulatory targets, in partnership with Pfizer (formerly Seagen), and Boston Pharmaceutics. 

In the Pfizer collaboration, SGN-BB228, a CD228 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody-Anticalin compound, was previously handed over to Pfizer, which is responsible for further advancement and funding of the asset. In January 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Pfizer-sponsored Phase 1 study of SGN-BB228, upon which we achieved a 5.0 million milestone. Pfizer presented preclinical data for this program at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 37th Annual Meeting in November 2022 and at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April 2023. Pfizer presented the study design of the Phase 1 study of SGN-BB228 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2023. The program is one of three programs in the Pfizer alliance, and we believe the previous achievement of a key development milestone for SGN-BB228 validates our approach in IO bispecifics, complementing the encouraging clinical data seen with cinrebafusp alfa. We transferred the second and third programs to Pfizer at the end of 2023, and retain a co-promotion option for one program in the Pfizer collaboration in the United States. 

BOS-342 is a GPC3 x 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin compound that we have exclusively licensed to Boston Pharmaceuticals. In August 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Boston Pharmaceuticals sponsored Phase 1/2 study of BOS-342 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which we received a 2.5 million milestone payment and are entitled to receive up to approximately 350 million in potential development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, and tiered royalties on potential sales of BOS-342.

Our former drug candidates include:

Elarekibep , a former respiratory program that was partnered with AstraZeneca for the treatment of asthma, was a drug candidate that antagonizes IL-4R , thereby inhibiting the downstream action of IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines known to be key mediators in the inflammatory cascade that drive the pathogenesis of asthma and other inflammatory diseases. 

In June 2023, AstraZeneca communicated to us its decision to discontinue and cease dosing in the P hase 2 clinical studies of elarekibep. This decision was based on lung findings from a non-clinical 13-week GLP toxicology study with dry powder inhaler-formulated elarekibep, which did not support long-term use and progression to later-stage development. The 13-week non-human primate study included three active dose cohorts. AstraZeneca concluded that there were no clinical observations across any of the doses but that there were respiratory tract pathology findings. These findings included inflammation-mediated lung tissue damage, which did not appear to be dose related. AstraZeneca s decision was made independent of any data from the Phase 2a study. 

In July 2023, AstraZeneca notified us of its intention to terminate the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement and the AstraZeneca Platform License, which terminations became effective October 15, 2023. AstraZeneca s decision to terminate these agreements was based on the non-clinical safety findings in a 13-week toxicology study of elarekibep in non-human primates previously disclosed by us. Based upon our review, we have determined to discontinue the program for scientific reasons. 

PRS-220 , an orally inhaled Anticalin protein targeting connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF, was being developed as a local treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and other forms of fibrotic lung diseases. CTGF, a matricellular protein, has been demonstrated to be a driver of fibrotic tissue remodeling and the protein has been found over-expressed in lung tissue from patients suffering from IPF. 

In 2021, we received a 14.2 million grant from the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy supporting research and development of the PRS-220 program. We conducted a Phase 1 study of PRS-220 in healthy volunteers in Australia, which we completed in August 2023. The study was a randomized, two-part, blinded, placebo-controlled study, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of single and multiple ascending doses of PRS-220 when administered by oral inhalation to healthy subjects. The clinical study report was finalized at the end of December 2023. Data from the single and multiple ascending doses of PRS-220, when administered by oral inhalation to healthy subjects, demonstrated that PRS-220 was safe and generally well tolerated by subjects in this study at all administered doses. With the completion of the Phase 1 clinical studies, we have decided to discontinue further development of the program for strategic and scientific reasons. 

Cinrebafusp alfa is designed to drive tumor localized T cell activation through tumor-targeted drug clustering mediated by HER2 expressed on tumor cells. This program was the first 4-1BB bispecific T cell co-stimulatory agonist to enter clinical development. 

In July 2022, we received fast track designation from FDA for cinrebafusp alfa. In August 2022, we announced the decision to cease further enrollment in the two-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study of cinrebafusp alfa as part of a strategic pipeline prioritization to focus our resources. Cinrebafusp alfa has demonstrated clinical benefit in Phase 1 studies, including single agent activity in a monotherapy setting, and in the Phase 2 study in HER2-expressing gastric cancer, giving the Company confidence in its broader 4-1BB franchise. In April 2023, clinical data showing an unconfirmed 100 objective response rate and promising emerging durability profile were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting. This data provided encouraging evidence of clinical activity for this program. We previously attempted to partner our cinrebafusp alfa program and because we were ultimately unable to find a partner for this program, we discontinued the program and partnering efforts. 

S095012 (also referenced as PRS-344) is a bispecific Mabcalin compound comprising a PD-L1-targeting antibody genetically linked to 4-1BB-targeting Anticalin proteins being developed by Servier on a worldwide basis. The first-in-human Phase 1/2 multicenter open-label dose escalation study was designed to determine the safety and preliminary activity of S095012 in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. In July 2023, we notified Servier that we were opting out of co-development and commercialization of S095012 in the United States. On June 28, 2024, Servier notified us of its decision to terminate the Servier Agreements, effective December 27, 2024, and discontinue and cease dosing in the Phase 1 clinical study of S095012. This decision was based on a potential safety concern in the S095012 Phase 1 clinical studies. We do not intend to pursue any further development of S095012. 

In May 2021, we also entered into a multi-program research collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to discover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies. In April and May 2023, the ophthalmology and respiratory programs were jointly discontinued, respectively. Genentech also had options to select two additional programs with the payment of a fee, which expired in May 2024. With the expiration of these options and no programs active or ongoing, the Genentech Agreement also expired. 

Since inception, we have devoted nearly all of our efforts and resources to our research and development activities and have incurred significant net losses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net loss of 2.9 million and 11.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reported net loss of 10.8 million and 20.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 326.3 million. We expect to continue incurring substantial losses as we devote time and resources into exploring strategic transactions. Our operating expenses have historically been comprised of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.

Table of Contents 

We have not generated any revenues from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were from license and collaboration agreements with our partners. 
 
 A significant portion of our operations are conducted in countries other than the United States. Since we conduct our business in U.S. dollars, our main exposure, if any, results from changes in the exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar. At each period end, we remeasure assets and liabilities to the functional currency of that entity (for example, U.S. dollar payables recorded by our subsidiary, Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH). Remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations line item Other income (expense), net . All assets and liabilities denominated in euros are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. All adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 
 Key Financial Terms and Metrics 
 
 The following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We have not generated any revenues from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenues for the last two years have been from the license and collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca, Servier, Pfizer, Genentech and Boston Pharmaceuticals. 
 
 The revenues from AstraZeneca, Servier, Pfizer, Genentech and Boston Pharmaceuticals have been comprised primarily of upfront payments, research and development services and milestone payments. For additional information about our revenue recognition policy, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 The process of researching and developing drugs for human use is lengthy, unpredictable and subject to many risks. Historically, we have incurred substantial expenses as we continued to develop our clinical and preclinical drug candidates and programs. Also included in research and development costs in 2023 were severance costs associated with the workforce reduction announced in July 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, we had stopped or taken actions to wind down research and development costs related to all proprietary programs. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, we announced that we would be discontinuing all of our research and development activities. We have no further spending obligations related to our partnered IO programs. We expect research and development costs to be significantly lower than historical amounts. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation and other personnel-related costs associated with executive, administrative and other support staff. Other significant general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with professional fees for accounting, auditing, insurance costs, consulting and legal services along with facility and maintenance costs attributable to general and administrative functions. Included in general and administrative costs are costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives and severance costs associated with the workforce reductions announced in July 2023 and March 2024. We expect general and administrative costs to be significantly lower than historical amounts given the leaner organization and elimination of research and development spending going forward.

The 15.6 million decrease in customer revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is entirely due to no revenue being recognized in the current period as all obligations related to customer revenue have previously been satisfied. 

The 4.0 million decrease in collaboration revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due to no revenue pass through cost or collaboration reimbursement being recognized in the current period as all obligations related to the collaboration agreement have previously been satisfied.

The 37.7 million decrease in customer revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects only the final, minimal amounts of reimbursement revenue being recognized in the current period as all obligations related to customer revenue have previously been satisfied. 

The 3.8 million decrease in collaboration revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects final minimal amounts of reimbursement revenue recorded in the current period, as compared to the reimbursement revenue related to the now-terminated S095012 product under the Servier collaboration agreement recorded in the prior period.

The 0.5 million decrease in our respiratory programs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to the completion of winddown activities related to PRS-220 and PRS-400, in connection with the Company's strategic update that was announced and initiated in July 2023. The credit balance for respiratory program expense in the current period is primarily due to a favorable final settlement on the amount owed to a single vendor compared to original estimates. 

The 1.6 million decrease in our immuno-oncology programs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to decreases in manufacturing and clinical costs for both cinrebafusp alfa and S095012, as such programs have been discontinued or were handed over to partners. The credit balance for IO expense in the current period is primarily due to a favorable final settlement on the amount owed to a single vendor compared to the original estimates. 

The 7.9 million decrease in other research and development activities expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March 2024, no depreciation in 2024 as a result of the Company's asset sale, and lower overall lab supply costs due to the lab facility wind down.

The 11.4 million decrease in our respiratory programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to the completion of winddown activities related to PRS-220 and PRS-400 in connection with our strategic update that was announced and initiated in July 2023. The credit balance for respiratory program expense in the current period is primarily due to a favorable final settlement on the amount owed to a single vendor compared to the original estimates. 

The 5.7 million decrease in our immuno-oncology programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due primarily to decreases in manufacturing and clinical costs for both cinrebafusp alfa and S095012, as such programs have been discontinued or handed over to partners. Offsetting IO expense in the first half of 2024, we benefitted from a favorable final settlement in the third quarter of 2024 on the amount owed to a single vendor compared to the original estimates. 

The 18.7 million decrease in other research and development activities expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March 2024, no depreciation in 2024 as a result of our asset sale, and lower overall lab supply costs due to the lab facility wind down. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period decrease was driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March 2024, no depreciation in 2024 as a result of the Company's asset sale process, lower professional services spending given the winddown of programs and activities, and lower rent and facility costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher legal spending related to ongoing strategic alternative evaluation and the impact of lower allocated facility and information technology, or IT, costs to research and development departments given the winddown of research and development programs and activities. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period decrease was driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March 2024 and no depreciation in 2024 as a result of the Company's asset sale process and lower professional services spending given the winddown of programs and activities. These benefits were partially offset by higher legal spending related to ongoing strategic alternative evaluation and the impact of lower allocated facility and IT costs to research and development departments given the winddown of research and development programs and activities. 

Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Our other income was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Period-over-period there was a decrease in interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and unrealized losses in the current period due to an overall strengthening U.S. dollar. This was partially offset by a net gain on the sales of all property and equipment compared to the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale. 
 
 Our other income was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period decrease was primarily due to lower grant income and lower interest income, offset slightly by unrealized gains in the current period due to an overall strengthening U.S. dollar and a net gain on the sales of all property and equipment compared to the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 On March 27, 2024, the Company announced the implementation of a new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend its cash runway into at least 2027, while maximizing its ability to capture the potential milestones from its partnered 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin protein IO assets. The Company may be entitled to aggregate milestones of up to approximately 15.0 million upon first patient dosed in the Phase 2 trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342, which are currently in Phase 1 clinical development, and up to approximately 40.0 million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342. 
 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily through private and public sales of equity, payments received under our license and collaboration agreements (including research and development services costs, and upfront and milestone payments), government grants and loans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 19.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We have incurred losses in every period since inception, with the exception of the three months ended June 30, 2023, and have a total accumulated deficit of 326.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years. 
 
 We have historically devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expenses to support such research and development. 
 
 We expect cash necessary to fund operations will continue to decrease significantly in the near term as we have taken measures to preserve cash, including implementing significant workforce reductions and terminating all research and development activities. 
 
 The following table provides a summary of operating, investing and financing cash flows (in thousands):

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.3 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of 34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operations in the current period is predominantly attributable to the 38.9 million impact of a reduction in deferred revenue and an offsetting 4.8 million decrease in accounts receivable in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the current period in which, given the winddown of operating programs and suspension of research and development activities, there was no cash used in operations related to deferred revenue and only a 0.2 million decrease in accounts receivable. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.3 million, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 8.6 million for the same period in 2023. The change in net cash used is predominantly attributable to the impact of net investments changes and the timing of maturities in the current period as well as proceeds on the sale of all assets, as compared to the prior period. 
 
 There was no net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 19.8 million for the same period in 2023. The change in net cash used is predominantly attributable to the 19.7 million impact of the issuance of stock resulting from the ATM Program (as defined in Note 9) sales activity performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 22, 2024, we effected a 1-for-80 reverse stock split of our common stock. All references to shares of common stock outstanding, average number of shares outstanding and per share amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split on a retroactive basis. 
 
 In August 2021, we established the ATM Program under a sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of gross sales proceeds of 50.0 million. In November 2022, the sales agreement was amended to provide for an increase in the aggregate offering amount, such that under the ATM Program, as amended, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of gross sales proceeds of 75.0 million. The ATM Program, as amended, is offered under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with and declared effective by the SEC in August 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares under the ATM Program. 
 
 On July 23, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the PIPE Investors, including BVF Partners, L.P., an existing stockholder of Pieris, pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase (either for cash or in exchange for the termination and cancellation of outstanding convertible notes issued by Palvella), and we agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of approximately 3,154,241 of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and/or in lieu of our common stock to certain purchasers who so choose, the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 2,592,585 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant equal to the Purchase Price minus 0.001, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of us, on the one hand, and the PIPE Investors, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Merger. The gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing are expected to be approximately 78.9 million, before paying estimated expenses. The closing of the PIPE Financing is expected to occur in connection with and immediately following the consummation of the Merger. 

The Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire, and each Pre-Funded Warrant will be exercisable at any time after the date of issuance of such Pre-Funded Warrant, subject to a beneficial ownership limitation. A holder of a Pre-Funded Warrant may not exercise such Pre-Funded Warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 4.99 or 9.99 of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, provided, however, that a holder may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation by giving 61 days notice to us, but not to any percentage in excess of 19.99 .

At or prior to the closing of the PIPE Financing, we will enter into the Registration Rights Agreement with the PIPE Investors pursuant to which the PIPE Investors will be entitled to certain resale registration rights with respect to shares of our common stock issued to the PIPE Investors and any shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we will be required to prepare and file a resale registration statement with the SEC within 30 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing. We shall use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause this registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 90 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing (or within 120 days following the PIPE Financing if the SEC reviews the registration statement). 
 We are currently subject to the SEC general instructions of Form S-3 known as the baby shelf rules. Under these instructions, the amount of funds we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any 12-month period using our registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates. Therefore, we will be limited in the amount of proceeds we are able to raise by selling shares of our common stock using our Form S-3, including under the ATM Program, until such time as our public float exceeds 75 million. 
 
 We have historically devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expenses to support such research and development. We expect cash necessary to fund operations will continue to de crease significantly as we have decided to discontinue all research and development activities and implement a further workforce reduction, as disclosed in our March 27, 2024 strategic update.

Table of Contents 

We believe that our currently available funds will be sufficient to fund our remaining limited operations through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Our belief with respect to our ability to fund operations is based on estimates that are subject to these and other risks and uncertainties. 
 
 If we seek to raise additional capital to fulfill our operating and capital requirements through public or private equity financings, utilization of our current ATM Program, strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements, government grants and/or the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all, and the terms of any future financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, contingencies, research and development expense and income taxes, and there have not been significant changes to our accounting policies discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2023. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each standard will have. For the recently issued accounting standards that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 
 Currently, we qualify as a smaller reporting company. 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible for and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public reporting companies that do not qualify for this classification, including, but not limited to: 

An opportunity for reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic and annual reports, including exemption from the requirements to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures, 

An opportunity for reduced financial statement disclosure in registration statements and in annual reports on Form 10-K, which only requires two years of audited financial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public companies, 

An opportunity for reduced audit and other compliance expenses as we are not subject to the requirement to obtain an auditor s report on internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and 

An opportunity to utilize the non-accelerated filer time-line requirements. 

For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of both the reduced internal control audit requirements and the disclosure obligations available to us as a result of this classification. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not party to and our property is not subject to any material pending legal proceedings. However, from time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims seeking monetary damages or other relief. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings or claims could have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Please refer to the complete Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, and Item 1A of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024 and August 14, 2024, respectively, for risks and uncertainties facing the Company that may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. There have been no material changes in the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.
