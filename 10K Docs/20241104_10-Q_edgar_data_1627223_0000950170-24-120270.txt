The Titanium Technologies segment is a leading, global provider of TiO 2 pigment, a premium white pigment used to deliver whiteness, brightness, opacity, durability, efficiency and protection across a variety of applications. The Advanced Performance Materials segment is a leading, global provider of high-end polymers and advanced materials that deliver unique attributes, including low friction coefficients, extreme temperature resistance, weather resistance, ultraviolet and chemical resistance, and electrical insulation. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to The Chemours Company , Chemours , the Company , our Company , we , us , and our refer to The Chemours Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to EID refer to EIDP, Inc., formerly known as E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, which is Chemours former parent company and is now a subsidiary of Corteva, Inc. Corteva ). Reference herein to DuPont refer to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company s results for interim periods have been included. The notes that follow are an integral part of the Company s interim consolidated financial statements. The Company s results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of its results for a full year, and the year-end consolidated balance sheet does not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP. As such, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Audit Committee Internal Review On February 29, 2024, the Company announced that it needed additional time to complete its year-end reporting process, including its review of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit Committee to complete a related internal review (the Audit Committee Internal Review ). The scope of the Audit Committee Internal Review included, among other things, reviewing (i) the process for reviewing reports made to the Chemours Ethics Hotline; (ii) the Company s practice for managing working capital, including the related impact on metrics within the Company s incentive plans; and (iii) certain non-GAAP metrics included in filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise publicly released, and related disclosures. The Audit Committee has completed its planned procedures with respect to the Internal Review and determined, among other things, based on the review conducted with the assistance of independent outside counsel, that: the Company's then-Chief Executive Officer, then-Chief Financial Officer, and then-Controller engaged in efforts in the fourth quarter of 2023 to delay payments to certain vendors that were originally due to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2023 until the first quarter of 2024, and to accelerate the collection of receivables into the fourth quarter of 2023 that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2024; 

 these individuals engaged in these efforts in part to meet free cash flow targets that the Company had communicated publicly, and which also would be part of a key metric for determining incentive compensation applicable to executive officers; and 

 there was a lack of transparency with the Company s Board of Directors by the members of former senior management who were placed on administrative leave with respect to these actions. 

 Further discussion related to the Audit Committee Internal Review is included under the heading " Securities Related Litigation and Requests for Information Arising From Audit Committee Internal Review, and Related Indemnification Agreements " within "Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities".

Substantially all of the Company s net sales are derived from goods and services transferred at a point in time. Contract Balances The Company s assets and liabilities from contracts with customers constitute accounts receivable - trade, deferred revenue, and customer rebates. An amount for accounts receivable - trade is recorded when the right to consideration under a contract becomes unconditional. An amount for deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received prior to the conclusion that a contract exists, or when a customer transfers consideration prior to the Company satisfying its performance obligations under a contract. Customer rebates represent an expected refund liability to a customer based on a contract. In contracts with customers where a rebate is offered, it is generally applied retroactively based on the achievement of a certain sales threshold. As revenue is recognized, the Company estimates whether or not the sales threshold will be achieved to determine the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price. 

Contract liabilities: 

Deferred revenue 

Customer rebates (Note 15) 

Changes in the Company s deferred revenue balances resulting from additions for advance payments and deductions for amounts recognized in net sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not significant. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of net sales recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods (e.g., due to changes in transaction price) were not significant.

Chemours consists of operating segments: Thermal Specialized Solutions, Titanium Technologies, Advanced Performance Solutions, and Performance Chemicals Intermediates (included in Other Segment). The Company defines its reporting units as operating units or one level below its operating segments. The Company completes its annual goodwill impairment test on October 1 each year, or more frequently if triggering events indicate a possible impairment. The Company continually evaluates financial performance, economic conditions and other recent developments in assessing if a triggering event indicates that the carrying values of goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired. The total accumulated goodwill impairment losses included in the Company's goodwill balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to and . During the third quarter of 2024, the Company reviewed recently released third-party industry projections, which for hydrogen now reflect lower end-market demand as well as slower market growth through 2030 and a more uncertain long-term growth trajectory beyond 2030. In response to these negative market outlook developments as well as increased commercial headwinds due to limited cyclical end-markets recovery and competitive intensity, the Company has revised its financial projections for the Advanced Performance Materials business which includes reductions to its investment plans. The Company concluded that these market developments, as well as the Company's revised financial projections to reflect these events, represented a triggering event for the Company's Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and associated goodwill, as well as the related asset group, during the third quarter of 2024. As a result of this conclusion, the Company completed an interim impairment assessment as of August 31, 2024 for its Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and the related asset group.

With the Effective date of such settlement being reached, Chemours no longer maintains its reversionary interest to the underlying restricted funds within the Water District Settlement Fund and, as such, the restricted cash and cash equivalents and the associated accrued liabilities were derecognized in the second quarter of 2024. Further discussion related to the U.S public water system class action suit settlement is included under the heading United States Public Water System Class Action Suit Settlement and Related Opt-Outs within this Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . In September 2023, the parties entered into a supplemental agreement to the MOU, whereby the parties agreed to (i) release the funds held in escrow to fund, in part, the Water District Settlement Fund (discussed further below), (ii) waive the escrow funding obligation of each party due no later than September 30, 2023, and (iii) with respect to the escrow funding obligation due no later than September 30, 2024, waive the obligation of each of the parties under certain conditions as agreed to by the parties. The parties agreed to fund the payments due by September 30, 2024, and the Company funded into the escrow account on September 30, 2024. As such, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and deposited into the escrow account, respectively. The parties have also sought insurance coverage for certain claims relating to PFAS matters, including claims in the AFFF MDL. In July 2024, a settlement agreement was reached amongst the parties with one of the insurance carriers. Per agreement with the parties, the Company will receive approximately of the settlement as it will be allocated amongst the parties in accordance with the percentage contribution in the Public Water System Class Action Settlement. Accordingly, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain within selling, general, and administrative expense in the Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations. The parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into additional agreements reflecting the terms set forth in the MOU.

 lawsuits pending against EID alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos, respectively. These cases are pending in state and federal court in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and are individually set for trial. A small number of cases are pending outside of the U.S. Most of the actions were brought by contractors who worked at sites between the 1950s and the 1990s. A small number of cases involve similar allegations by EID employees or household members of contractors or EID employees. Finally, certain lawsuits allege personal injury as a result of exposure to EID products. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Chemours had accruals of related to these matters, respectively. Benzene In the Separation, EID assigned its benzene docket to Chemours. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were and cases pending against EID alleging benzene-related illnesses, respectively. These cases consist of premises matters involving contractors and deceased former employees who claim exposure to benzene while working at EID sites primarily in the 1960s through the 1980s, and product liability claims based on alleged exposure to benzene found in trace amounts in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents used to manufacture EID products such as paints, thinners, and reducers. Management believes that a loss is reasonably possible as to the docket as a whole; however, given the evaluation of each benzene matter is highly fact-driven and impacted by disease, exposure, and other factors, a range of such losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In May 2021, the Company and EID filed suit in Delaware state court against multiple insurance companies for breach of their contractual obligations to indemnify Chemours and EID against liabilities, costs and losses relating to benzene litigation which are covered under liability insurance policies purchased by EID during the period 1967 to 1986. EID and Chemours are seeking payment of all costs and settlement amounts for past and future benzene cases falling under those policies. The outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material impact on Chemours results of operations or financial position. PFOA Chemours does not, and has never, used PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acids and its salts, including the ammonium salt) as a polymerization aid nor sold it as a commercial product. Prior to the Separation, the performance chemicals segment of EID made PFOA at its Fayetteville Works site in Fayetteville, North Carolina Fayetteville and used PFOA as a polymerization aid in the manufacture of fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers at certain sites, including: Washington Works, Parkersburg, West Virginia; Chambers Works, Deepwater, New Jersey ("Chambers Works"); Dordrecht Works, Netherlands; Changshu Works, China; and, Shimizu, Japan. These sites are now owned and/or operated by Chemours. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Chemours maintained an accrual of and , respectively, related to PFOA matters under the Leach Settlement (discussed below), EID s obligations under agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ), and voluntary commitments to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the NJ DEP ). These obligations and voluntary commitments include surveying, sampling, and testing drinking water in and around certain Company sites and offering treatment or an alternative supply of drinking water if tests indicate the presence of PFOA in drinking water at or greater than the applicable levels. The Company will continue to work with EPA, NJ DEP and other authorities regarding the extent of work that may be required with respect to these matters.

 residents living near the Washington Works facility had suffered, or may suffer, deleterious health effects from exposure to PFOA in drinking water. Among the settlement terms, EID funded a series of health studies by an independent science panel of experts C8 Science Panel to evaluate available scientific evidence on whether any probable link exists, as defined in the settlement agreement, between exposure to PFOA and disease. The C8 Science Panel found probable links, as defined in the settlement agreement, between exposure to PFOA and pregnancy-induced hypertension, including preeclampsia, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis, and diagnosed high cholesterol. Under the terms of the settlement, EID is obligated to fund up to for a medical monitoring program for eligible class members and pay the administrative costs associated with the program, including class counsel fees. The court-appointed Director of Medical Monitoring implemented the program, and testing is ongoing with associated payments to service providers disbursed from an escrow account which the Company replenishes pursuant to the settlement agreement. Through September 30, 2024 , approximately has been disbursed from escrow related to medical monitoring. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will incur additional costs related to the medical monitoring program, such costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties surrounding the level of participation by eligible class members and the scope of testing. In addition, under the Leach settlement agreement, EID must continue to provide water treatment designed to reduce the level of PFOA in water to area water districts and private well users. At Separation, this obligation was assigned to Chemours and is included in the 55 and accrued at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. PFOA Leach Class Personal Injury Further, under the Leach settlement, class members may pursue personal injury claims against EID only for those diseases for which the C8 Science Panel determined a probable link exists. Approximately lawsuits were subsequently filed in various federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia and consolidated in multi-district litigation MDL in Ohio federal court. These were resolved in when EID entered into an agreement settling all MDL cases and claims, including all filed and unfiled personal injury cases and claims that were part of the plaintiffs counsel s claims inventory, as well as cases tried to a jury verdict (the First MDL Settlement for in cash, with half paid by Chemours, and half paid by EID. Concurrently with the First MDL Settlement, EID and Chemours agreed to a limited sharing of potential future PFOA costs (i.e. Indemnifiable Losses , as defined in the Separation Agreement between EID and Chemours) for a period of . The cost-sharing agreement entered concurrently with the First MDL Settlement has been superseded by the binding MOU addressing certain PFAS matters and costs. For more information on this matter refer to Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU with DuPont, Corteva and EID within this Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities . While all MDL lawsuits were dismissed or resolved through the First MDL Settlement, the First MDL Settlement did not resolve PFOA personal injury claims of plaintiffs who did not have cases or claims in the MDL or personal injury claims based on diseases first diagnosed after February 11, 2017. Approximately plaintiffs filed matters after the First MDL Settlement. In January 2021, EID and Chemours entered into settlement agreements with counsel representing these plaintiffs, providing for a settlement of all but one of the then filed and pending cases, as well as additional pre-suit claims, under which those cases and claims of settling plaintiffs were resolved for approximately (the Second MDL Settlement ). Chemours contributed approximately , and DuPont and Corteva each contributed approximately to the Second MDL Settlement. The single matter not included in the Second MDL Settlement was a testicular cancer case tried in March 2020 to a verdict of in compensatory and emotional distress damages and in loss of consortium damages. The jury found that EID s conduct did not warrant punitive damages. In March 2021, the trial court issued post-trial rulings which reduced the consortium damages to . The Company paid its share from the verdict in this matter in November 2023 after all of EID s appeals process from United States Court of Appeals to the United States Supreme Court were denied. In December 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (JPML) declined to close the Ohio MDL. As of September 30, 2024, 44 plaintiffs purporting to be Leach class members have filed personal injury cases. Trial was scheduled to start in September 2024 for two plaintiffs, with a second trial scheduled to start in March 2025 for two plaintiffs. Prior to the start of the first trial in September, EID and Chemours entered into an agreement in principle with counsel representing MDL plaintiffs providing for settlement for all filed and pending cases in the MDL as well as additional pre-suit claims. The Ohio MDL court has ordered the parties to file a joint status report on November 4, 2024 unless a stipulation of dismissal is filed before then, and the parties discussions on a settlement continue with the term sheet being finalized. As of September 30, 2024, based on the status of ongoing settlement discussions between the parties and the plaintiffs' counsel, the Company recorded an accrual for for this matter.

 to a qualified settlement fund Water District Settlement Fund ). Contribution rates were consistent with the MOU, with Chemours (together with its subsidiaries) contributing , and DuPont and Corteva collectively (together with their subsidiaries) contributing the remaining . The settlement amounts were funded in full and deposited into the Water District Settlement Fund. On September 6, 2023, Chemours deposited into the Water District Settlement Fund, which was recognized as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. In exchange for the payment to the Water District Settlement Fund, Chemours, Corteva and DuPont (together with their subsidiaries) will receive a release of the claims from the Class (as defined below), upon entry into final judgment by the Court in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. The agreement was entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and is not in any way an admission of liability or fault by Chemours or the other parties. The class represented in the Settlement Agreement is composed of all Public Water Systems, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 300f, with a current detection of PFAS or that are currently required to monitor for PFAS under the Environmental Protection Agency s Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule or other applicable federal or state law (the Class ). The following systems are excluded from the settlement class: water systems owned and operated by a State or the United States government; small systems that have not detected the presence of PFAS and are not currently required to monitor for it under federal or state requirements; and water systems in the lower Cape Fear River Basin of North Carolina (which are included only if they so request). PFAS, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, includes PFOA and HFPO-DA among a broad range of fluorinated organic substances. While it is reasonably possible that the excluded systems or claims could result in additional future lawsuits, claims, assessments or proceedings, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such matters, and as such, the Company is unable to develop an estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, at this time. The Settlement Agreement does not resolve claims of Public Water Systems that are not included in the settlement as described above, or of Public Water Systems that requested exclusion from the Class opt out pursuant to the process established by the Court. It also does not resolve potential future claims of Public Water Systems that have not detected and do not detect any PFAS contamination, but where such contamination first occurs in the future. The Settlement Agreement also does not resolve certain claims not related to drinking water, such as certain specified separate alleged claims relating to stormwater or wastewater treatment, or other alleged types of claims such as for personal injury or for natural resource damages claimed by state attorneys general, that remain outstanding in the AFFF MDL or other courts. Matters related to claims from other public water systems, state natural resources damages and other PFAS matters are further described below. As part of the preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement in August 2023, notice of the Settlement Agreement has been provided to class members and such members had until November 11, 2023 to object to the settlement or December 4, 2023 to submit a request for exclusion, indicating they wish to opt-out of the settlement class. A Final Fairness Hearing on the Settlement Agreement occurred on December 14, 2023. 

 32 

The Chemours Company Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 of the listed potential Class members. In addition to those opt-outs, the Notice Administrator stated that he also received requests for exclusion from approximately additional entities that were not on the list of Class members. The Court issued an order providing that the deadline for entities to withdraw a previously submitted opt-out was March 1, 2024, which was subsequently extended to March 15, 2024 by the Court. The Notice Administrator s determinations are not dispositive of the validity of opt-outs, which may be subject to judicial review and the Notice Administrator also continues to review the opt-outs for whether they were proper or duplicative. Chemours, Corteva and DuPont deny the allegations in the underlying litigation and reserve all legal and factual defenses against such claims if they were litigated to conclusion. On February 8, 2024, the Court issued an opinion and order granting the plaintiffs motion for final approval of the settlement, and on February 26, 2024, the Court entered a final order and judgment. On March 11, 2024, one public water system filed a notice of appeal from the district court s judgment, and such appeal was dismissed in April 2024. No additional appeals were filed during the appeal period, and accordingly the court's approval is a final judgment in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. The Settling Defendants confirmed to the escrow agent in May 2024 that the Effective Date has occurred under the Settlement Agreement and Chemours no longer maintains its reversionary interest to the underlying restricted funds within the Water District Settlement Fund. With respect to the submitted opt-outs, for those entities that have filed claims and/or lawsuit against numerous defendants, including Chemours, EID, Corteva, DuPont, either prior or subsequent to the Settlement Agreement, approximately of such opt-out entities are in the U.S. District Court of South Carolina Multi-district litigation and approximately of such opt-out entities are named plaintiffs in other various federal, state or local courts (see Other Public Water System Matters below). The Company s assessment of its potential liability with respect to the opt-outs considers numerous factors, many of which are not yet determinable. Many of these lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues related to causation, scientific evidence and alleged actual damages and other substantial uncertainties. Other than a single opt-out matter, for which the Company is engaged in discussions with the opt-out entity and maintains an immaterial accrual, the Company has not accrued for any potential losses with respect to the opt-out population as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as such losses are not probable or estimable. Additional future lawsuits, claims, assessments or proceedings, including for those identified in the Other Public Water Systems Matters below, could be brought or maintained either by entities that submitted opt-outs, or by entities asserting claims that are expressly excluded from the releases in the Settlement Agreement. However, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such matter due to various reasons including, among others, legal and factual defenses against such claims including factors noted above, timing when such claims could be resolved in court, and the number of defendants in any of those claims. While management believes that it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur losses related to the matters, which could be material to the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, the Company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, at this time.

 to the State of Ohio, which shall be used to support environmental restoration. Chemours contribution is consistent with the contribution rate under the MOU. This amount is included in Accrued Litigation as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, and is expected to be paid in 2024 or 2025. On July 13, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva, and EID entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Delaware to settle such potential claims, including for environmental releases or sales of products containing PFAS or other known contaminants. Under the agreement, in January 2022, the companies paid a total amount of to the State of Delaware, which shall be utilized to fund a Natural Resources and Sustainability Trust (the Trust to be used for environmental restoration and enhancement of resources, sampling and analysis, community environmental justice and equity grants, and other natural resource needs. Chemours contributed to the settlement and the remaining was divided between DuPont and Corteva, which shall be treated as Qualified Spend under the MOU. If the companies enter into a proportionally similar agreement to settle or resolve claims of another state for PFAS-related natural resource damages, for an amount greater than , the companies may be required to make one or more supplemental payment(s) directly to the Trust, with such payment(s) not to exceed in the aggregate. Following entry of the settlement agreement with the State of Ohio and its payment and pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with the State of Delaware, the Companies will make a supplemental payment directly to the Trust in an amount equal to in the aggregate. Chemours share of such supplemental payment is approximately , which is included in Accrued Litigation as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, and is expected to be paid in 2024 or 2025. Other PFAS Matters In New York courts, EID has been named in approximately lawsuits beginning in 2017, which are not part of the Leach class, brought by individual plaintiffs alleging negligence and other claims in the release of PFAS, including PFOA, into drinking water against current and former owners and suppliers of a manufacturing facility in Hoosick Falls, New York. additional lawsuits have been filed by a business seeking to recover its losses and by nearby property owners and residents in a putative class action. The lawsuit filed by the business was dismissed, but the claims by the individual business owner were allowed to proceed. In September 2022, the Court certified the class action, and EID filed a petition for review of the certification, which was denied in January 2023. Chemours and EID entered into settlement agreements in principle to resolve all but of the pending lawsuits, including the class action suit, during the second quarter of 2023 and were substantially paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. In February 2024, the Company agreed to resolve all of the remaining individual cases and claims, including of the pending lawsuits for . As of September 2024, these settlements have all been paid consistent with prior reserves in the matters. Upon settlement completion and dismissal of the individual matters, the class action is the sole remaining lawsuit pending for these matters.

 lawsuits alleging that defendants are responsible for PFAS contamination, including PFOA and PFOS, in groundwater and drinking water. During the second quarter of 2023, the companies resolved these claims. lawsuits were also filed alleging exposure to PFAS and other chemicals, including lawsuits by parents on behalf of their adult children claiming pre-natal exposure, resulted in the children s cognitive delays, neurological, genetic, and autoimmune conditions. Further, additional lawsuits were filed in state court with similar allegations of personal injury, which have been removed to New Jersey federal court (and one of which was transferred to the AFFF MDL). In May 2024, a case alleging wrongful death from exposure to PFAS and other chemicals on behalf of two deceased residents of Salem County, NJ was filed naming Chemours in New Jersey state court. The case has also been removed to federal court. Plaintiffs seek certain damages including punitive damages. In Ohio federal court, a putative class action ("Hardwick") was filed in October 2018 against several defendants including 3M, EID and Chemours seeking class action status for U.S. residents having a detectable level of PFAS in their blood serum. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including the establishment of a PFAS Science Panel . In March 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff s class certification and certified a class covering anyone subject to Ohio laws having minimal levels of PFOA plus at least one other PFAS in their blood. The court requested further briefing on whether the class should be extended to include other states that recognize the claims for relief filed in the action. The defendants, including EID and Chemours, jointly filed a petition to appeal the class certification decision and in September 2022 the petition was granted. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Court dismissed the class action against 3M, EID, Chemours and the other defendants. In December, 2023, the plaintiff filed a petition for reconsideration and for rehearing en banc with the 6th Circuit. In January 2024, the 6th Circuit denied the request for rehearing. In March 2024, the case was dismissed. In June 2024, Hardwick refiled a putative national class action in federal court in Ohio against 3M, DuPont, and the Company. The refiled Hardwick suit seeks class status for all those in the United States who have 2 ppb or more of C8 (PFOA and PFOS combined) in their blood and who are subject to the laws of a state that recognizes medical monitoring. The complaint alleges negligence, battery and conspiracy and seeks equitable, declaratory, and injunctive relief including medical monitoring overseen by a court-appointed independent science panel. The complaint does not seek monetary damages or personal injury. In October 2024, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter. In Delaware state court, a putative class action was filed in May 2019 against two electroplating companies, 3M and EID, and two other defendants added in an amended complaint, alleging responsibility for PFAS contamination, including PFOA and PFOS, in drinking water and the environment in the nearby community. In November 2023, a motion to amend the complaint was filed seeking to add Chemours as a defendant. The putative class of residents alleges negligence, nuisance, trespass, and other claims and seeks medical monitoring, personal injury and property damages, and punitive damages. The matter has been removed to federal court. In South Carolina, a putative class action was filed in March 2022 in the state court against 3M, EID and the Company alleging PFAS contamination from a former textile plant located in Society Hill, South Carolina which allegedly used PFAS containing textile treatment chemicals supplied by the defendants. The lawsuit alleges negligence, trespass, strict liability and nuisance and seeks monetary damages, including property diminution, and injunctive relief, including water treatment and remediation, as well as punitive damages. The matter has been removed to federal court. In April 2024, EID and Chemours filed a third-party complaint against Huntsman, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Galey Lord, Nanotex and John Does alleging indemnification and contribution. In September 2024, Huntsman filed a counterclaim against EID and Chemours alleging indemnification and contribution. In August 2024, a complaint related to the same fabric mill was filed on behalf of an individual in South Carolina state court against 3M, EID, Chemours and other companies alleging personal injuries resulting from exposure to PFAS emissions from the former textile plant. The complaint alleged negligence, strict liability, products liability counts, and fraud and seek compensatory and punitive damages and costs. In August 2024, 3M removed the matter to federal court. In Maine, a previously filed lawsuit in federal court by individuals against various paper mills owners in Maine was amended in October 2022 to add various alleged suppliers to the paper mills as defendants, including EID. The lawsuit alleges PFAS chemicals were used in making paper products at the mills and that discharges, waste disposal and the selling of byproducts from paper mills caused property damages as well as personal injury to the plaintiffs. The lawsuit alleges various claims against the mills; alleges negligence, strict liability and nuisance against the supplier defendants; and seeks monetary damages. In March 2023, plaintiffs dismissed the case against EID and other defendants. In Pennsylvania, in December 2023, a lawsuit was filed in state court on behalf of multiple plaintiffs alleging that defendants including Chemours, EID, Corteva and DuPont, as manufacturers of chemicals used in gas well fracking, are responsible for contamination of the water supply. The lawsuit alleges negligence, personal injury, medical monitoring, property damage and punitive damages. In May 2024, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and did not name Chemours, EID, Corteva or DuPont de Nemours. In Delaware, in October 2023, a lawsuit was filed in state court on behalf of the spouse of a former EID employee, naming Chemours, EID, Corteva, DuPont and others alleging personal injury as a result of take-home exposure to PFAS and other compounds. The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

 lawsuits against Chemours and other defendants. The Directives are: (i) a state-wide PFAS Directive issued to EID, DowDuPont, DuPont Specialty Products USA DuPont SP USA ), Solvay S.A., 3M, and Chemours seeking a meeting to discuss future costs for PFAS-related costs incurred by NJ DEP and establishing a funding source for such costs by the Directive recipients, and information relating to historic and current use of certain PFAS compounds; and, (ii) a Pompton Lakes Natural Resources Damages NRD Directive to EID and Chemours demanding to cover the cost of preparation of a natural resource damage assessment plan and access to related documents. The lawsuits filed in New Jersey state courts by NJ DEP are: (i) in Salem County, against EID, 3M, and Chemours primarily alleging clean-up and removal costs and damages and natural resource damages under the Spill Act, the Water Pollution Control Act WPCA ), the Industrial Site Recovery Act ISRA ), and common law regarding past and present operations at Chambers Works, a site assigned to Chemours at Separation ; (ii) in Middlesex County, against EID, DuPont SP USA, 3M, and Chemours primarily alleging clean-up and removal costs and damages and natural resource damages under the Spill Act, ISRA, WPCA, and common law regarding past and present operations at Parlin, an EID owned site; (iii) in Gloucester County, against EID and Chemours primarily alleging clean-up and removal costs and damages and natural resource damages under the Spill Act, WPCA, and common law regarding past operations at Repauno, a non-operating remediation site assigned to Chemours at Separation which has been sold; and, (iv) in Passaic County, against EID and Chemours primarily alleging clean-up and removal costs and damages and natural resource damages under the Spill Act, WPCA, and common law regarding past operations at Pompton Lakes, a non-operating remediation site assigned to Chemours at Separation. The alleged pollutants listed in the Salem County and Middlesex County matters above include PFAS. Each lawsuit also alleges fraudulent transfer. In August 2020, a Second Amended Complaint was filed in each matter, adding fraudulent transfer and other claims against DuPont SP USA, Corteva, and DuPont. For the Salem County matter, NJ DEP added claims relating to failure to comply with state directives, including the state-wide PFAS Directive.

The Chemours Company Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 for the Chambers Works site, the majority of which is for non-PFAS remediation items. In March 2023, the four NJDEP lawsuits were referred to mediation by the federal court, with the proceedings in the matters stayed pending the mediation. In April 2024 NJDEP submitted to the court a letter declaring that the parties had reached an impasse in the mediation. A case management schedule was entered by the court in May 2024, with the Chambers Works and Pompton Lakes matter being active and the other two matters being administratively terminated without prejudice. In August 2024, Third Amended Complaints were filed in the Chambers Works and Pompton Lakes Works matters. Discovery is ongoing in the two active matters and pretrial papers are due for the Chambers Works matter in May 2025, with trial to begin in June 2025. In June 2024, Carneys Point Township filed a motion to intervene in such matter seeking to bring counterclaims against both the State of New Jersey and defendants, including Chemours, related to natural resource damages, remediation funding sources, ISRA penalties, off-site remediation and lost property taxes. Chemours believes that the January 2022 motion as directed to it is not supported by applicable law and the RFS sought by NJ DEP is not an appropriate estimate of remedial cost for the Chambers Works site and, subject to the discussions regarding overall remediation costs under Environmental Overview within this "Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities", management believes that a loss is reasonably possible, but not estimable at this time, due to various reasons, including that the motion is in its early stages and there are significant factual issues and legal questions to be resolved. EID requested that Chemours defend and indemnify it in these matters. Chemours has accepted the indemnity and defense of EID while reserving rights and declining EID s demand as to matters involving other EID entities, as well as ISRA and fraudulent transfer, subject to the terms of the MOU. PFOA and PFAS Summary With the exception of the individual matters specifically noted otherwise above, management believes that it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur losses related to PFOA and/or PFAS matters in excess of amounts accrued, but any such losses, which could be material to results of operations, financial position, or cash flows are not estimable at this time due to various reasons, including, among others, that some matters are in their early stages and that there are significant factual issues to be resolved. U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc. There are six lawsuits currently pending in Indiana federal court, including a putative class action, by area residents concerning the U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery multi-party Superfund site in East Chicago, Indiana. Several of the lawsuits allege that Chemours is now responsible for EID environmental liabilities. The lawsuits include allegations for personal injury damages, property diminution, and other damages. At Separation, EID assigned Chemours its former plant site, which is located south of the residential portion of the Superfund area, and its responsibility for the environmental remediation at the Superfund site. Management believes a loss, which could be material, is reasonably possible, but not estimable at this time due to various reasons including, among others, that such matters are in their early stages and have significant factual issues to be resolved.

 and of costs for these indemnification agreement requests during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These costs have been recorded within Selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company has not recorded any material liabilities for these matters as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as it cannot estimate the ultimate outcome at this time.

 to , followed by several years of operation, maintenance, and monitoring OM M activities. Remediation activities, including OM M activities, vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, and diverse regulatory requirements, as well as the presence or absence of other potentially responsible parties. In addition, for claims that Chemours may be required to indemnify EID pursuant to the Separation-related agreements, Chemours, through EID, has limited available information for certain sites or is in the early stages of discussions with regulators. For these sites in particular, there may be considerable variability between the clean-up activities that are currently being undertaken or planned and the ultimate actions that could be required. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, management currently estimates the potential liabilities may range up to approximately above the amount accrued at September 30, 2024. This estimate is not intended to reflect an assessment of Chemours maximum potential liability. As noted above, the estimated liabilities are determined based on existing remediation laws and technologies and the Company s planned remedial responses, which are derived from environmental studies, sampling, testing, and analyses. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations, primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies. Management will continue to evaluate as new or additional information becomes available in the determination of its environmental remediation liability. In October 2021, EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, identifying a comprehensive approach to addressing PFAS. The PFAS Strategic Roadmap sets timelines by which EPA plans to take specific actions through 2024, including establishing a national primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS and taking Effluent Limitations Guidelines actions to regulate PFAS discharges from industrial categories among other actions. As provided under its roadmap, EPA also released its National PFAS Testing Strategy, under which the agency will identify and select certain PFAS compounds for which it will require manufacturers to conduct testing pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA section 4. Chemours has received various test orders and has formed consortia to jointly manage compliance with the test order requirements. Chemours expects to receive future test orders, however the timing of the remaining test orders is not determinable at this time. The draft Effluent Limitations Guidelines for PFAS manufacturers as announced in the PFAS Strategic Roadmap is now expected to be proposed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Also in October 2021, EPA published a final toxicity assessment for GenX compounds that decreased the draft reference dose for GenX compounds based on EPA s review of new studies and analyses. On March 18, 2022, Chemours filed a petition to EPA requesting to withdraw and correct its toxicity assessment for GenX compounds, which was denied by EPA on June 14, 2022. The next day, on June 15, 2022, EPA released health advisories for four PFAS, including interim updated lifetime drinking water health advisories for PFOA and PFOS, and final health advisories for GenX compounds, including hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid HFPO Dimer Acid ), and another PFAS compound (PFBS). On July 13, 2022 the Company filed a Petition for Review of the GenX compounds health advisory, and the Third Circuit held argument on the petition in January 2024. In July 2024, the Third Circuit dismissed the Company s petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding the health advisory was not a final agency action. In March 2023, EPA proposed a national primary drinking water regulation (" NPDWR") to establish Maximum Contaminant Levels ("MCLs") for six PFAS, with PFOA and PFOS having MCLs as individual compounds (each proposed as 4 parts per trillion ("ppt")) and four other PFAS compounds, including HFPO Dimer Acid, having a hazard index approach limit on any mixture containing one or more of the compounds. The proposed PFAS NPDWR was subject to public comment until May 30, 2023, and on April 10, 2024 EPA issued its final rule, which included promulgating individual MCLs for PFOA and PFOS at 4ppt and individual MCLs for PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA at 10ppt. In addition, EPA finalized a hazard index of 1 (unitless) as the MCL for any mixture of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA and PFBS. The final rule became effective 60 days from publication in the Federal Register and the compliance date for public water systems in the U.S. to meet the MCLs is five years from the publication date. In June 2024, Chemours, as well as other organizations including the American Water Works Association and the American Chemistry Council, filed petitions for review of the final rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The petitioners filed opening briefs in October 2024 and briefing will continue to March 2025. Also in April 2024, EPA issued a final rule designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, which has also been challenged in the same appeals court. The environmental remediation liabilities and accrued litigation, as applicable, recorded for Fayetteville, Washington Works, Parkersburg, West Virginia and Chambers Works, Deepwater, New Jersey as of September 30, 2024 are based upon the existing Consent Orders, agreements and/or voluntary commitments with EPA, state and other local regulators and depending on the ultimate outcome of EPA s actions, could require adjustment to meet any new drinking water standards. It is reasonably possible that additional costs could be incurred in connection with EPA s actions, however, the Company cannot estimate the potential impact or additional cost at this time, due in part to the uncertainties of challenges to them, the regulatory implementation site by site, where applicable, the current condition and the additional sampling required to determine the level of contamination at the site, possible method(s) of remediation that may be required, and determination of other potential responsible parties. Refer to Fayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina below for further detail on the impact of EPA s final drinking water health advisory for GenX compounds, including HFPO Dimer Acid.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, of which and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, relate to Fayetteville (discussed further below). Fayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina Fayetteville has been in operation since the 1970s and is located next to the Cape Fear River southeast of the City of Fayetteville, North Carolina. Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid ("HFPO Dimer Acid"), (sometimes referred to as GenX or C3 Dimer Acid is manufactured at Fayetteville. The Company has operated the site since its Separation from EID in 2015. While the Company believes that discharges from Fayetteville to the Cape Fear River, on-site surface water, groundwater, and air emissions have not impacted the safety of drinking water in North Carolina, the Company is cooperating with a variety of ongoing inquiries and investigations from federal, state, and local authorities, regulators, and other governmental entities including EPA. Consent Order with North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality NC DEQ In February 2019, the North Carolina Superior Court for Bladen County approved a Consent Order CO between NC DEQ, Cape Fear River Watch ("CFRW"), and the Company, resolving the State s and CFRW s lawsuits and other matters (including Notices of Violation NOVs issued by the State). Under the terms of the CO, Chemours paid in March 2019 to cover a civil penalty and investigative costs and agreed to certain compliance measures (with stipulated penalties for failures to do so), including the following: Install a thermal oxidizer TO to control all PFAS in process streams from certain processes at Fayetteville at an efficiency of ; 

 Develop, submit, and implement, subject to approval from NC DEQ and CFRW, a plan for interim actions that are economically and technologically feasible to achieve the maximum PFAS reduction from Fayetteville to the Cape Fear River within a period; 

 Develop and implement, subject to approval, a Corrective Action Plan CAP that complies with North Carolina s groundwater standards and guidance provided by NC DEQ. At a minimum, the CAP must require Chemours to reduce the total loading of PFAS originating from Fayetteville to surface water by at least from baseline, as defined by the CO; and 

 Provide and properly maintain permanent drinking water supplies, including via whole-building filtration units and reverse osmosis RO units to qualifying surrounding properties with private drinking water wells. 

 In August 2020, NC DEQ, CFRW, and the Company reached agreement on the terms of an addendum to the CO (the Addendum ), which includes procedures for implementing specified remedial measures for reducing PFAS loadings from Fayetteville to the Cape Fear River. The Addendum also includes stipulated financial penalties, inclusive of daily and weekly fines for untimeliness in meeting deadlines for construction, installation and other requirements, as well as intermittent performance-based fines for noncompliance in meeting PFAS loading reduction requirements and removal efficiency targets. In October 2020, the Addendum was approved by the North Carolina Superior Court for Bladen County.

 years on an undiscounted basis based on the Company s current plans under the CO. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had and of accrued liabilities, respectively, for off-site groundwater testing and water treatment system installations at qualifying third-party properties primarily in Bladen and Cumberland counties surrounding Fayetteville, which is expected to be disbursed over approximately years. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had and , respectively, of accrued liabilities for the assessment and for sampling related to potential PFAS contamination of groundwater and supply of alternative drinking water in New Hanover and three other downstream counties. Off-site installation, maintenance, and monitoring cost estimates are based on management s assessment of the current facts and circumstances for these matters, including comments received from NC DEQ, and could change as actual experience may differ from management's estimates or new information may become available. The estimated liability was based on certain assumptions, which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and include, but are not limited to, implementation of the soil and groundwater assessment, the source and cause of PFAS contamination for the four downstream counties, the estimated number of properties at which sampling is conducted and whether such property will qualify for an alternative drinking water supply, other potentially responsible parties and the method of long-term alternative water supply, if any. Further, management s estimate of the ultimate liability for this matter is dependent upon NC DEQ approval of the proposed plans in response to various NC DEQ letters, obtaining additional information, implementation of EPA s health advisories, additional feasibility and investigation work that has not yet been scoped or performed, and the estimated additional future cost of OM M. The ultimate resolution of the matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flow. On-site surface water and groundwater remediation Abatement and remediation measures already taken by Chemours, including the capture and disposal of its operations process wastewater and other interim actions, have addressed and abated nearly all PFAS discharges from the Company s continuing operations at Fayetteville. However, the Company continues to have active dialogue with NC DEQ and other stakeholders regarding the potential incremental remedies that are both economically and technologically feasible to achieve the CO and Addendum objectives related to the impact of site surface water and groundwater contamination from historical operations, during and subsequent to the optimization period of the groundwater treatment system and following installation of the barrier wall.

 and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to the estimated cost of on-site remediation, based on the range of potential outcomes on current potential remedial options, and the projected amounts to be paid over a period of approximately years. The final costs of any selected remediation will depend primarily on permit compliance requirements, ongoing dialogue with NC DEQ and other stakeholders regarding the potential incremental remedies that are both economically and technologically feasible to achieve the CO and Addendum objectives, and estimated future cost and time period of OM M. Further, the final cost of the on-site groundwater treatment system depends on water treatment requirements and estimated carbon usage. As such, cost estimates could change as actual experience may differ from management's estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in results of operations in the period that the events and circumstances giving rise to such changes occur. The Company s estimated liability for the remediation activities that are probable and estimable is based on the CO, the Addendum, the CAP, and management s assessment of the current facts and circumstances, which is subject to various assumptions including the transport pathways (being pathways by which PFAS reaches the Cape Fear River) that will require remedial actions, the types of interim and permanent site surface water and on-site remedies and treatment systems selected and implemented, the estimated cost of such potential remedies and treatment systems, any related OM M requirements, and other charges contemplated by the CO and the Addendum. The Company accrued years of OM M for Fayetteville environmental remediation systems based on the CO and Addendum, which includes estimated higher power consumption, ongoing monitoring, pretreatment, filtering supplies (principally carbon) and regular maintenance of the system over a -year period of estimated operation starting in . It is possible that issues relating to site discharges in various transport pathways, the selection of remediation alternatives to achieve PFAS loading reductions, or the operating effectiveness of the TO could result in further litigation and/or regulatory demands with regards to Fayetteville, including potential permit modifications or penalties under the CO and the Addendum. It is also possible that, as additional data is collected on the transport pathways and dialogue continues with NC DEQ and other stakeholders, the type or extent of remediation actions required to achieve the objectives committed to in the CO may change (increase or decrease) or remediation activities could be delayed. If such issues arise, or if the CO is further amended, an additional loss is reasonably possible, but not estimable at this time.

 actions encompassing approximately private well owners seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Ruling on the Company s motions in April 2019, the court dismissed the medical monitoring, injunctive demand, and many other alleged causes of actions in these lawsuits. In October 2023, the court certified the property damages class action. In March 2023, one of the public water suppliers brought a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against EID, Chemours, Corteva and DuPont alleging voidable transfer and other claims arising from the Chemours separation and DowDuPont merger and subsequent restructurings, asset transfers and separations; the matter is now stayed. In addition to natural resource damages matter filed by the State of North Carolina (as discussed within the PFAS section of this Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities ), in September 2020, additional lawsuits were filed in North Carolina state court against Chemours and EID, as well as other defendants. One of the lawsuits is a putative class action on behalf of residents who are served by the Cape Fear Public Water utility, alleges negligence, nuisance, and other claims related to the release of perfluorinated compounds from Fayetteville, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages and medical monitoring. The other two lawsuits were filed on behalf of individuals residing near Fayetteville and allege negligence, nuisance, and other claims related to the release of perfluorinated compounds. The individuals seek compensatory property damages, punitive damages, and, in some cases, medical monitoring. All three lawsuits allege fraudulent transfer against EID and other EID entities, but not against Chemours. In October 2020, the cases were removed to federal court and then the lawsuits filed on behalf of individuals were remanded back to state court. In March 2022, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of an individual residing near the Fayetteville site against Chemours, EID and other defendants alleging negligence, nuisance and other claims related to the discharges from the Fayetteville site. The individual seeks compensatory property damages, punitive damages and medical monitoring. The lawsuit also alleges fraudulent transfer against EID and other EID entities, but not against Chemours. Also, in March 2022, Cumberland County, North Carolina filed suit in state court against Chemours, EID and other defendants related to discharges from the Fayetteville site alleging negligence, nuisance, trespass and fraudulent transfer. The lawsuit seeks damages as well as injunctive and equitable relief. In December 2022, Aqua North Carolina, Inc. filed suit in North Carolina state court alleging EID, DuPont, DowDuPont, Inc and the Company are responsible for polyfluorinated chemical contamination of the Cape Fear River, groundwater and other water sources used by Aqua North Carolina across the state to serve its water customers. The complaint alleges product liability, negligence, trespass, deceptive trade practices, unjust enrichment and fraudulent transfer. Plaintiff seeks equitable relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages. In February 2023, the matter was removed to federal court. In July 2024, the court dismissed the claims for products liability, deceptive trade practices and public nuisance. As of September, 2024, lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina on behalf of 59 individuals residing near Fayetteville against Chemours, EID, Corteva and DuPont alleging personal injury, property damages and deceptive trade practices related to the discharges from Fayetteville. The individuals seek compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorney fees and punitive damages. In December 2023 and January 2024, amended complaints were filed in each case dropping fraudulent transfer claims. In September 2024, the court dismissed claims for deceptive trade practices, public nuisance, negligence per se and trespass to chattels. It is possible that additional litigation may be filed against the Company and/or EID concerning the Fayetteville discharges. It is not possible at this point to predict the timing, course, or outcome of all governmental and regulatory inquiries and notices and litigation related to Fayetteville, and it is reasonably possible that these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, local communities, organizations, and federal and state regulatory agencies have raised questions concerning HFPO Dimer Acid and other perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds at certain other manufacturing sites operated by the Company. It is possible that additional developments similar to those described above and centering on Fayetteville could arise in other locations.

Recent Developments 
 
 2024 Restructuring Plan 
 
 In line with our strategic priorities for creating long-term shareholder value, management initiated an organizational redesign to further align the cost structure of our Advanced Performance Materials business and corporate functions with its financial objectives. As a result of the 2024 Restructuring Program, for the period ended September 30, 2024, we recorded charges of 46 million, consisting of non-cash asset related charges of 25 million, employee separation charges of 18 million and other charges of 3 million. We currently expect that the 2024 Restructuring Program will result in future run-rate cost savings that approximate one to two times the cash costs incurred to date, which are expected to be realized by the end of 2025. These savings are part of our broader cost-out operating model with targeted cost savings across each of the businesses and corporate overhead. Refer to "Note 5 Restructuring, Asset-related and Other Charges" to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Charge 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we concluded a triggering event was present for our Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and associated goodwill. As a result of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis performed, we concluded the carrying amount of the Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit exceeded its fair value, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 56 million. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within this Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as "Note 11 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net" to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.

Our net sales increased by 14 million (or 1 to 1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net sales of 1.5 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase in our net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a volume increase of 5 , partially offset by a decrease in price of 3 and unfavorable currency movements of 1 . Price declined across all our reportable segments. The volume increase was attributed to our Thermal Specialized Solutions and Advanced Performance Materials segments. 
 
 Our net sales decreased by 278 million (or 6 to 4.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net sales of 4.7 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in price of 5 . Price declined across all our reportable segments. Portfolio change driven by the sale of our Glycolic Acid business in 2023 added a 1 headwind to our net sales. 
 
 The key drivers of these changes for each of our reportable segments are discussed further under the Segment Reviews section within this MD A . 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Our cost of goods sold COGS was relatively flat at 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as higher sales volumes were offset by lower raw materials costs. Our COGS decreased by 105 million (or 3 to 3.5 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with COGS of 3.6 billion for the same period in 2023.

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense 
 
 Our selling, general, and administrative SG A expense decreased by 30 million (or 18 and 651 million (or 61 to 135 million and 416 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with SG A expense of 165 million and 1.1 billion for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in our SG A expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in litigation-related charges as a result of benefits from insurance recoveries recognized in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in our SG A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the litigation-related charges of 592 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023 primarily related to the U.S. public water system settlement agreement, along with the benefits recorded in the second and third quarters of 2024 for insurance recoveries. The decreases in our SG A expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were partially offset by 2 million and 24 million, respectively, of costs incurred related to the Audit Committee internal review process, along with third-party costs related to the Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan. 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 Our research and development R D expense was relatively flat at 29 million and 83 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with R D expense of 28 million and 82 million for the same periods in 2023.

In addition, our restructuring, asset-related, and other charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 16 million related to our first quarter of 2023 decision to abandon our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning software platform implementation. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Charge 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we concluded a triggering event was present for our Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and associated goodwill. As a result of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis performed, we concluded the carrying amount of the Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit exceeded its fair value. As a result of this analysis, f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 56 million related to the Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit.

 Equity in Earnings of Affiliates 
 
 Our equity in earnings of affiliates decreased by 2 million (or 15 and 4 million (or 11 to 11 million and 34 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with equity in earnings of affiliates of 13 million and 38 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in our equity in earnings of affiliates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower demand in the region where our investees operate.

The increase in our interest expense, net was primarily attributable to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt and higher debt principal following issuance of new term loans in August 2023. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Our other income, net decreased by 95 million (or 93 and 90 million (or 90 to 7 million and 10 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with other income, net of 102 million and 100 million for the same periods in 2023. Our other income, net in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, includes a net pre-tax gain on sale of 106 million, associated with the Glycolic Acid Transaction. The decrease in our other income, net was partially offset by favorable changes in net exchange gains and losses. 
 
 (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 We had a benefit from income taxes of 3 million and a provision for income taxes of 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represented effective tax rates of 10 and 8 , respectively. The 4 million increase in our benefit from income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to changes in our geographic mix of earnings and non-recurring items. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 10 million of income tax benefit related to the 2024 Restructuring Program. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a 28 million income tax benefit associated with the Kuan Yin, Taiwan plant shutdown, net of a 13 million valuation allowance recorded on certain deferred tax assets of one of our Taiwanese subsidiaries and 26 million of income tax expense associated with the Glycolic Acid Transaction. We continued to record the impact of the enactment of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules ("Pillar Two") in the quarter, which was overall not material.

Segment Net Sales 
 
 Our Thermal Specialized Solutions segment s net sales increased by 24 million (or 6 to 460 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with segment net sales of 436 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in segment net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of 8 , partially offset by a decrease in price of 2 . The increase in volume was primarily due to higher demand within the Opteon TM Refrigerants portfoli o as a result of continued stationary and automotive end-market adoption, along with increased demand in the Foam, Propellants and Other portfolio. The increase in volume was partially offset by declines in the Freon Refrigerants portfolio. The decrease in p rice was primarily related to weaker Freon Refrigerants portfolio pricing due to elevated hydrofluorocarbon ("HFC") market inventory levels. The decrease in price was partially offset by stronger Opteon Refrigerants portfolio pricing. Currency was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Our Thermal Specialized Solutions segment s net sales decreased by 23 million (or 2 to 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with segment net sales of 1.4 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in segment net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in price of 3 , partially offset by an increase in volume of 1 . Price decreases were primarily attributable to the same factors discussed in the preceding paragraph. Volumes increases primarily due to higher demand within the Opteon Refrigerants portfolio as a result of continued stationary and automotive end-market adoption, partially offset by declines in the Freon Refrigerants portfolio in connection with the step downs under the AIM Act and EU F-Gas regulation. Currency was flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 21 million (or 13 to 141 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by approximately 600 basis points to 31 , compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of 162 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 108 million (or 19 to 453 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by approximately 700 basis points to 32 , compared with segment Adjusted EBITDA of 561 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 39 for the same period in 2023. The decreases in segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in price related to the Freon Refrigerants portfolio, increased costs to secure additional near-term quota allowances, and higher raw material costs. The decreases in segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were partially offset by the aforementioned increases in volume within the Opteon TM Refrigerants portfoli o as a result of continued stationary end-market adoption. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were attributable to the aforementioned decrease in price related to the Freon Refrigerants portfolio, increased costs related to near-term quota allowances, lower fixed cost absorption, higher raw material costs, and decrease in volumes within the Freon Refrigerants portfolio, partially offset by higher demand within the Opteon Refrigerants portfolio as a result of continued stationary and automotive end-market adoption.

The Chemours Company 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and available cash. We also periodically utilize various financing facilities, including our receivables securitization facility and supply chain financing arrangements with third-party financial institutions to provide working capital flexibility. Additionally, we have access to incremental liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our debt financing arrangements, which includes borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. We expect the liquidity from these sources will provide adequate funds to support the cash needs of our businesses through at least the end of November 2025. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 596 million, of which 394 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The availability under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 was 652 million, net of 49 million in outstanding letters of credit, and is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including those related to the last twelve months of our consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") and senior secured net debt, both of which are defined under the Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, our availability under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased compared to prior periods due to a decline in our trailing twelve-month EBITDA. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement. Our debt financing arrangements are described in further detail in Note 20 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the first significant long-term debt maturity is the 441 million 491 million) senior unsecured notes due May 2026. It is our expectation that we will refinance this amount prior to maturity, though there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete this refinancing on attractive terms at a given point in time, or at all. Subject to approval by our board of directors, we may raise additional capital or borrowings from time to time or seek to refinance our existing debt. There can be no assurances that future capital or borrowings will be available to us, and the cost and availability of new capital or borrowings could be materially impacted by market conditions. Our borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies. On June 3, 2024, Moody s affirmed our Ba3 rating with stable outlook. On March 17, 2024, S P Global affirmed our BB- credit rating with negative outlook. Our debt ratings could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to and/or increase the cost of funding our operation. Further, the decision to refinance our existing debt is based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including general market conditions and our ability to refinance on attractive terms at any given point in time. Any attempts to raise additional capital or borrowings or refinance existing debt could cause us to incur significant charges, including an increase in interest expense as a result of higher interest rates on any new or refinanced borrowings. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in normal and customary working capital management actions. Ordinary course working capital management actions may include managing the timing of payables or receivables where permitted in accordance with the payment terms, utilizing supply chain financing arrangements, and utilizing the accounts receivable securitization facility described in Note 16 Debt to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements , among other actions, where appropriate and deemed to be in our commercial interest. 
 
 As disclosed in "Note 2 Basis of Presentation" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Audit Committee, conducted with the assistance of independent outside counsel, an internal review, and determined, among other things, that former members of senior management engaged in efforts in the fourth quarter of 2023 to delay payments of up to approximately 100 million, primarily to certain vendors that were originally due to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2023 until the first quarter of 2024; and to accelerate the collection of up to approximately 260 million of receivables into the fourth quarter of 2023 that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2024. The Audit Committee s review also determined that similar actions, though to a lesser extent, were taken in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting in a delay of up to approximately 40 million of payments to vendors that were originally due to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022 until the first quarter of 2023 and the acceleration of the collection of up to approximately 175 million of receivables into the fourth quarter of 2022 that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 These working capital timing actions favorably impacted operating cash flows in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and had correspondingly adverse impacts on operating cash flows in the first quarters of 2024 and 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net 771 million usage of cash in operating activities, which included accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable uses of cash of 348 million and 95 million, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 74 million, which included accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable uses of cash of 212 million and 333 million, respectively. The working capital uses of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were largely driven by, among other things, the payment of the accounts payable delayed from the prior fourth quarters and lower collections of accounts receivable due to efforts to accelerate those collections into the prior fourth quarters that impacted the first quarters of 2024 and 2023. Refer to the "Cash Flows" section below for further details of the changes in operating cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 67 

The Chemours Company 

 While we have historically generated operating cash flows through various past industry and economic cycles, we do have a historical pattern of seasonality with a working capital use of cash in the first half of the year, primarily driven by seasonal accounts receivable timing and, to a lesser extent, inventory builds, and a working capital source of cash in the second half of the year, as we sell product from inventory and collect receivables from customers. We currently anticipate that we will remain in compliance with applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement through at least November 2025. 
 
 Throughout the year, we utilize supply chain financing arrangements with several third-party financial institutions to manage our working capital needs and enhance liquidity. We also participate in certain customers supply chain financing and other early pay programs as a routine source of working capital. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we utilized various customer facilitated supply chain financing facilities to accelerate the collection of 40 million and 95 million, respectively, of our accounts receivable, incurring an immaterial discount amount for both periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accelerated the collection of approximately 168 million and 300 million, respectively, of our accounts receivable, incurring an immaterial discount amount for both periods. These actions improved our quarter end liquidity by approximately 38 million and 86 million, respectively, for the quarters ended on September 30, 2024 and 2023 based on the stated collection terms of the receivables. See Note 8 - Accounts and Notes Receivable, Net to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our supplier financing programs. 
 
 A substantial majority of the 394 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2024, is available for local operations or is readily convertible into currencies used in our worldwide operations, including the U.S. dollar. We are subject to restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, which impose certain limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received approximately 441 million of net cash in the U.S. through intercompany loans and dividends. We believe we have the ability to fund U.S. operations cash requirements for working capital, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and other financing requirements through a mixture of repatriations, intercompany loans, and other actions. For further information related to our income tax positions, refer to Note 9 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 In addition, we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. 
 
 Over the course of the next 12 months and beyond, we anticipate making significant cash payments for known contractual and other obligations, which we expect to fund through cash generated from operations, available cash (including the current portion of restricted cash), receivables securitization, and our existing debt financing arrangements. Such obligations include principal and interest obligations on long-term debt, MOU Funding requirements, funding restructuring obligations, contractual obligations for operating and finance leases, purchase obligations, legal settlement agreements, and our expectations for capital expenditures, which except as noted below, did not significantly change from what was previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our contractual and other obligations also include: 
 Environmental remediation We, due to the terms of our Separation-related agreements with EID, are subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require further action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or releases of chemical substances, which are attributable to EID s activities before our spin-off. Much of this liability results from Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA ), and similar federal, state, local, and foreign laws. These laws may require us to undertake certain investigative, remediation, and restoration activities at sites where we conduct, or EID once conducted, operations or at sites where waste generated by us was disposed. At September 30, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets include 567 million for environmental remediation liabilities, of which 119 million was classified as current, and a portion is subject to recovery under the MOU. Of the current environmental liabilities of 119 million, 67 million relates to Fayetteville. Pursuant to the binding MOU that we entered into with DuPont, Corteva, and EID in January 2021, costs related to potential future legacy PFAS liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct will subject to the cost-sharing arrangement, where we bear half of the cost of such future potential legacy PFAS liabilities and DuPont and Corteva will collectively bear the other half of the cost of such future potential legacy PFAS liabilities up to an aggregate 4 billion, of which approximately 2.0 billion is available after consideration of the funding of the payment to the State of Ohio and supplemental payment to the State of Delaware (discussed below). Refer to the Environmental Matters section within this MD A for the anticipated environmental remediation payments over the next three years. Refer to Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the MOU and Qualified Spend.

The Chemours Company 

 PFAS escrow funding requirements Pursuant to the binding MOU that we entered into with DuPont, Corteva, and EID in January 2021, the parties have agreed to establish an escrow account in order to support and manage the payments for potential future legacy PFAS liabilities. In September 2023, we entered into a supplemental agreement to the binding MOU with DuPont, Corteva, and EID, whereby the parties agreed to i) release funds held in escrow to fund, in part, the qualified settlement fund per the terms of the U.S. public water system settlement agreement, ii) waive the escrow funding obligation of each party due no later than September 30, 2023 and iii) waive the escrow funding obligation due no later than September 30, 2024 under certain conditions as agreed to by the parties. The parties agreed to fund the payments due by September 30, 2024, and we funded 50 million into the escrow account on September 30, 2024. As such, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2021, we had 50 million and 0 million deposited into the escrow account, respectively. The next escrow payment of 50 million is expected to be made on or before September 30, 2025 and on or before September 30 of each subsequent year through and including 2028. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the escrow account (including interest) is less than 700 million, the balance of the escrow is to be restored to such amount, with Chemours making 50 of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva together making 50 of the deposits. Such payments will be made in a series of five consecutive annual equal installments commencing on September 30, 2029 pursuant to the escrow account replenishment terms as set forth in the MOU. Refer to Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Other legal settlements - In addition to the legal items noted above, we have other legal settlements that we expect to pay within the next 12 months and beyond. In November 2023, we, DuPont, Corteva, and EID entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Ohio to settle claims, including for environmental releases or sales of products containing PFAS or other known contaminants. Our share of this settlement is 55 million, representing our portion of the contribution consistent with the MOU entered into among the parties in January 2021. Following the settlement agreement with the State of Ohio and pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement with the State of Delaware entered into in 2021, we will also contribute our portion, 13 million, of a supplemental payment owed to the State of Delaware and expect to pay these amounts in 2025. We have accrued litigation of 201 million at September 30, 2024, which is inclusive of the settlement agreements with Ohio and Delaware, of which 114 million is classified as current. Refer to Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

We continue to believe our sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund our planned operations and to meet our principal, interest, dividend, income taxes, and contractual obligations through at least the end of November 2025. Our capital allocation strategy is consistent with our core values and our CRC goals and seeks to: (i) focus investments in growth initiatives to enhance our portfolio; (ii) improve our leverage profile; (iii) responsibly resolve contingent legal and/or accrued environmental liabilities on terms and bases deemed to be in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders; and (iv) return cash to shareholders through regular quarterly dividends. Specific to our objective to return cash to shareholders, in recent quarters, we have previously announced quarterly dividends of 0.25 per share, amounting to approximately 150 million per year, and, on October 23, 2024, we announced our quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. Under our 2022 Share Repurchase Program, as further discussed in Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and in "Note 19 - Equity" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have remaining authority to repurchase 441 million of our outstanding common stock, though we do not anticipate additional repurchases under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program.

Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents decreased by 584 million (or 97 to 20 million at September 30, 2024, compared with restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of 604 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the release of the 592 million of cash and cash equivalents deposited in the qualified settlement fund per the terms of the U.S. public water settlement agreement following Final Judgment, as defined in the U.S. public water settlement agreement. This matter is further discussed in "Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities" to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Our accounts and notes receivable, net increased by 341 million (or 56 to 951 million at September 30, 2024, compared with accounts and notes receivable, net of 610 million at December 31, 2023. This increase in our accounts and notes receivable, net at September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher sales in the third quarter of 2024 driving higher receivables when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, along with the acceleration of receivables collection in the fourth quarter of 2023 that were originally not due to be received until the first quarter of 2024. The increase in our accounts receivable, net was partially offset by increased utilization of our Securitization Facility. 
 
 Our inventories increased by 86 million (or 6 to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with inventories of 1.4 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in our inventories at September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher inventories within our Thermal Specialized Solutions business in advance of plant maintenance activity in the fourth quarter of 2024, along with build-up of our finished product inventories within our Advanced Performance Materials business following maintenance activity in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Our prepaid expenses and other increased by 9 million (or 14 to 75 million at September 30, 2024, compared with prepaid expenses and other of 66 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in our prepaid expenses and other was primarily due to increases in our prepaid insurance premiums.

Our accounts payable decreased by 90 million (or 8 to 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with accounts payable of 1.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our accounts payable at September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the timing of vendor payments in the first quarter of 2024, resulting from efforts to delay payments to certain vendors in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Our compensation and other employee-related costs remained largely unchanged at 89 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our current environmental remediation decreased by 10 million (or 8 to 119 million at September 30, 2024 compared with current environmental remediation of 129 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our current environmental remediation was primarily attributable to lower environmental remediation accruals at the USS Lead Superfund site following completion of the remaining obligations under the 2021 Record of Decision and Statement of Work. Refer to "Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities" to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 Our other accrued liabilities decreased by 611 million (or 58 to 447 million at September 30, 2024 compared with other accrued liabilities of 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our other accrued liabilities was primarily attributable to the derecognition of the accrued liabilities related to the U.S. public water system settlement agreement following Final Judgment, as defined in the U.S. public water system settlement agreement. This matter is further discussed in "Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities" to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The decrease in our other accrued liabilities was partially offset by an increase in our accrued interest due to timing of payment under our senior unsecured notes.

The Chemours Company 

 Supplier Financing 
 
 We maintain supply chain finance programs with several financial institutions. The available capacity under these programs can vary based on the number of investors and/or financial institutions participating in these programs at any point in time. See "Note 14 Accounts Payable" to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding supplier financing programs. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 There have been no material changes to the off-balance sheet arrangement described in our MD A and "Note 20 Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Historically, we have not made any payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, we believe we have the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees in the event required. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates, as described in our MD A and Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, remain materially consistent. However, due to the ongoing financial and economic conditions impacting the Company, we re-evaluated certain of its estimates, most notably its estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of its Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and related asset group during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Long-lived Assets 
 
 We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of recognition or measurement of an impairment charge, the assessment is performed on the asset or asset group at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. To determine the level at which the assessment is performed, we consider factors such as revenue dependency, shared costs, and the extent of vertical integration. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value, which is made based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies, including present value techniques. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held for use until their disposal. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair market value, less the estimated costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization are ceased for a disposal group upon it being classified as held for sale. 
 
 The testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which our segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth, and inflation rates, can significantly impact the outcome of our impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in the factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, we continually review our diverse portfolio of assets to ensure that they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with our growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded non-cash asset-related charges of 25 million primarily related to the write off of certain operating assets and associated construction-in-progress and other assets with no future intended use, as part of strategic footprint transformation initiatives within the Advanced Performance Materials business. Refer to Note 5 Restructuring, Asset-related, and Other Charges to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to these charges. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of 78 million related to the shutdown of our TiO 2 manufacturing facility in Kuan Yin, Taiwan. 
 74 

The Chemours Company 

 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company reviewed recently released third-party industry projections, which for hydrogen now reflect lower end-market demand, as well as slower market growth through 2030 and a more uncertain long-term growth trajectory beyond 2030. In response to these negative market outlook developments, as well as increased commercial headwinds due to limited cyclical end-markets recovery and competitive intensity, the Company has revised its financial projections for the Advanced Performance Materials business which includes reductions to its investment plans. The Company concluded that these market developments, as well as the Company's revised financial projections to reflect these events, represented a triggering event for the Company's Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and associated goodwill, as well as the related asset group, during the third quarter of 2024. As a result of this conclusion, the Company completed an interim impairment assessment as of August 31, 2024 for its Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and the related asset group. The Company concluded that the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and that an impairment did not exist. 
 
 Notwithstanding the results of the Company's trigger-based interim impairment assessment during the third quarter of 2024, further negative market developments, notably as it relates to the hydrogen market or future strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets, may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets and such an assessment could result in future impairment losses. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using a combination of discounted cash flow models (a form of the income approach) and the guideline public company method (a form of the market approach). These valuation models incorporate a number of assumptions and judgments surrounding general market and economic conditions and internal forecasts of future business performance that are based on short- and long-term revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins and prospective financial information surrounding future cash flows of the reporting unit. Discount rate and market multiple assumptions are determined based on relevant peer companies in the chemicals sector. 
 
 As described above, we concluded that a triggering event was present for our Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit during the third quarter of 2024. As a result of the interim quantitative goodwill impairment analysis performed, we concluded that the carrying amount of the Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit exceeded its fair value resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 56 million, which was recorded within Goodwill impairment charge on the Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. After this impairment charge, as of September 30, 2024, goodwill for the Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit was 0 million. 
 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, goodwill for the Thermal Specialized Solutions and Titanium Technologies reporting units was 33 million and 13 million respectively. The Company has not identified a triggering event for either of these reporting units since the last annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2023, and therefore no interim impairment assessment has been performed for either reporting unit. As of October 1, 2023, for our Thermal Specialized Solutions reporting unit, a qualitative assessment was performed, that indicated it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value. As of October 1, 2023, for our Titanium Technologies reporting unit, the estimated fair value was 67 higher than the carrying value of the reporting unit.

The Chemours Company 

 Environmental Matters 
 
 Consistent with our values and our Environment, Health, Safety, and Corporate Responsibility policy, we are committed to preventing releases to the environment at our manufacturing sites to keep our people and communities safe, and to be good stewards of the environment. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, standards, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of harm to people and the environment, and that our handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 Environmental Remediation 
 
 In large part, because of past operations, operations of predecessor companies, or past disposal practices, we, like many other similar companies, have clean-up responsibilities and associated remediation costs, and are subject to claims by other parties, including claims for matters that are liabilities of EID and its subsidiaries that we may be required to indemnify pursuant to the Separation-related agreements executed prior to our separation from EID on July 1, 2015 (the Separation ). 
 
 Our environmental liabilities include estimated costs, including certain accruable costs associated with on-site capital projects. The accruable costs relate to a number of sites for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, whether or not subject to enforcement activities, as well as those obligations that result from environmental laws such as CERCLA, RCRA, and similar federal, state, local, and foreign laws. These laws may require certain investigative, remediation, and restoration activities at sites where we conduct, or EID once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. Our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include environmental remediation liabilities of 567 million and 590 million, respectively, relating to these matters, which, as discussed in further detail below, include 356 million and 383 million, respectively, for Fayetteville. 
 
 As remediation efforts progress, sites move from the investigation phase Investigation to the active clean-up phase Active Remediation ), and as construction is completed at Active Remediation sites, those sites move to the operation, maintenance, and monitoring OM M ), or closure phase. As final clean-up activities for some significant sites are completed over the next several years, we expect our annual expenses related to these active sites to decline over time. The time frame for a site to go through all phases of remediation (Investigation and Active Remediation) may take about 15 to 20 years, followed by several years of OM M activities. Remediation activities, including OM M activities, vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, and diverse regulatory requirements, as well as the presence or absence of other Potentially Responsible Parties PRPs ). In addition, for claims that we may be required to indemnify EID pursuant to the Separation-related agreements, we and EID may have limited available information for certain sites or are in the early stages of discussions with regulators. For these sites, there may be considerable variability between the clean-up activities that are currently being undertaken or planned and the ultimate actions that could be required. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, we currently estimate the potential liabilities may range up to approximately 710 million above the amount accrued at September 30, 2024. This estimate is not intended to reflect an assessment of our maximum potential liability. The estimated liabilities are determined based on existing remediation laws and technologies and our planned remedial responses, which are derived from environmental studies, sampling, testing, and analyses. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations, primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies. We will continue to evaluate as new or additional information becomes available in the determination of our environmental remediation liability. 
 
 In general, uncertainty is greatest, and the range of potential liability is widest in the Investigation phase, narrowing over time as regulatory agencies approve site remedial plans. As a result, uncertainty is reduced, and sites ultimately move into OM M, as needed. As more sites advance from Investigation to Active Remediation to OM M or closure, the upper end of the range of potential liability is expected to decrease over time. Some remediation sites will achieve site closure and will require no further action to protect people and the environment and comply with laws and regulations. At certain sites, we expect that there will continue to be some level of remediation activity due to ongoing OM M of remedial systems. In addition, portfolio changes, such as an acquisition or divestiture, or notification as a PRP for a multi-party Superfund site, could result in additional remediation activity and potentially additional accrual. 
 
 Management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows for any given year, as such obligation can be satisfied or settled over many years.

 Significant Environmental Remediation Sites 
 
 While there are many remediation sites that contribute to our total accrued environmental remediation liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following table sets forth the liabilities of the five sites that are deemed the most significant, during the periods presented, together with the aggregate liabilities for all other sites.

The five sites listed above represent 80 and 83 of our total accrued environmental remediation liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For these five sites, we expect to spend, in the aggregate, 160 million over the next three years. For all other sites, we expect to spend 71 million over the next three years. 
 
 Chambers Works, Deepwater, New Jersey Chambers Works 
 
 The Chambers Works complex is located on the eastern shore of the Delaware River in Deepwater, Salem County, New Jersey. The site comprises the former Carneys Point Works in the northern area and the Chambers Works manufacturing area in the southern area. Site operations began in 1892 when the former Carneys Point smokeless gunpowder plant was constructed at the northern end of Carneys Point. Site operations began in the manufacturing area around 1914 and included the manufacture of dyes, aromatics, elastomers, chlorofluorocarbons, and tetraethyl lead. We continue to manufacture a variety of fluoropolymers and finished products at Chambers Works. In addition, two tenants operate processes at Chambers Works. As a result of over 100 years of continuous industrial activity, site soils and groundwater have been impacted by chemical releases. 
 
 In response to identified groundwater contamination, a groundwater interceptor well system IWS was installed in 1970, which was designed to contain contaminated groundwater and restrict off-site migration. Additional remediation is being completed under a federal RCRA Corrective Action permit. The site has been studied extensively over the years, and more than 25 remedial actions have been completed to date and engineering and institutional controls put in place to ensure protection of people and the environment. In 2017, a site perimeter sheet pile barrier intended to more efficiently contain groundwater was completed. 
 
 Remaining work beyond continued operation of the IWS and groundwater monitoring includes completion of various targeted studies on site and in adjacent water bodies to close investigation data gaps, as well as selection and implementation of final remedies under RCRA Corrective Action for various solid waste management units and areas of concern not yet addressed through interim measures. Discussions are ongoing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the NJ DEP relating to such remaining work as well as the scope of remedial programs and investigation relating to the Chambers Works site historic industrial activity as well as ongoing remedial programs. 
 
 Fayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina 
 
 Fayetteville is located southeast of the City of Fayetteville in Cumberland and Bladen counties, North Carolina. The facility encompasses approximately 2,200 acres, which were purchased by EID in 1970, and are bounded to the east by the Cape Fear River and to the west by North Carolina Highway 87. Currently, we manufacture fluorinated monomers, fluorinated vinyl ethers, Nafion TM membranes and dispersions, and polymerization aids at the site. A former manufacturing area, which was sold in 1992, produced nylon strapping and elastomeric tape. EID sold its Butacite and SentryGlas manufacturing units to Kuraray America, Inc. in September 2014. In July 2015, upon our Separation from EID, we became the owner of the Fayetteville land assets along with fluoromonomers, Nafion TM membranes, and the related polymerization aid manufacturing units. A polyvinyl fluoride resin manufacturing unit remained with EID. 
 77 

The Chemours Company 

 Beginning in 1996, several stages of site investigation were conducted under oversight by NC DEQ, as required by the facility's hazardous waste permit. In addition, the site has voluntarily agreed to agency requests for additional investigations of the potential release of PFAS beginning with PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acids and its salts, including the ammonium salt) in 2006. As a result of detection of GenX in on-site groundwater wells during our investigations in 2017, NC DEQ issued a Notice of Violation NOV in September 2017 alleging violations of North Carolina water quality statutes and requiring further response. Since that time, and in response to three additional NOVs issued by NC DEQ and pursuant to the Consent Order (as discussed below), we have worked cooperatively with the agency to investigate and address releases of PFAS to on-site and off-site groundwater and surface water. 
 
 As discussed in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements , we, along with NC DEQ and Cape Fear River Watch CFRW ), a non-profit organization, have filed a final Consent Order CO that comprehensively addressed various issues, NOVs, and court filings made by NC DEQ regarding Fayetteville and resolved litigations filed by NC DEQ and CFRW. In connection with the CO, a thermal oxidizer TO became fully operational at the site in December 2019 to reduce aerial PFAS emissions from Fayetteville. The CO requires us to provide permanent replacement drinking water supplies, via connection to public water supply, whole building filtration units and/or reverse osmosis units, to qualifying surrounding residents, businesses, schools, and public buildings with private drinking water wells. 
 
 In 2020, we, along with NC DEQ and CFRW, reached agreement on the terms of an addendum to the CO (the Addendum ). The Addendum establishes the procedure to implement specified remedial measures for reducing PFAS loadings from Fayetteville to the Cape Fear River, including construction of a barrier wall with groundwater extraction system to be completed by March 15, 2023, or an extended date in accordance with the Addendum. In June 2023, we completed the construction of the barrier wall with a groundwater extraction and treatment system in accordance with the requirements under the CO. In October 2023, we submitted the engineer's certification confirming that the barrier wall was constructed and documented to be in conformance with the accepted design. 
 
 Further discussion related to Fayetteville is included under the heading Fayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 
 Pompton Lakes, New Jersey 
 
 During the 20th century, blasting caps, fuses, and related materials were manufactured at Pompton Lakes, Passaic County, New Jersey. Operating activities at the site were ceased in the mid-1990s. The primary contaminants in the soil and sediments are lead and mercury. Groundwater contaminants include volatile organic compounds. Under the authority of EPA and NJ DEP, remedial actions at the site are focused on investigating and cleaning-up the area. Groundwater monitoring at the site is ongoing, and we have installed and continue to install vapor mitigation systems at residences within the groundwater plume. In addition, we are further assessing groundwater conditions. In September 2015, EPA issued a modification to the site s RCRA permit that requires us to dredge mercury contamination from a 36-acre area of the lake and remove sediment from two other areas of the lake near the shoreline. The remediation activities commenced when permits and implementation plans were approved in May 2016, and work on the lake dredging project is now complete. In April 2019, we submitted a revised Corrective Measures Study CMS proposing actions to address on-site soils impacted from past operations that exceed applicable clean-up criteria. We received comments on the CMS from EPA and NJ DEP in March 2020, and we responded to their comments in June 2020 and continue to seek resolution with EPA. 
 
 U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc., East Chicago, Indiana 
 
 The U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc. USS Lead Superfund site is located in the Calumet neighborhood of East Chicago, Lake County, Indiana. The site includes the former USS Lead facility along with nearby commercial, municipal, and residential areas. The primary compounds of interest are lead and arsenic which may be found in soils within the impacted area. The EPA is directing and organizing remediation on this site, and we are one of a number of parties working cooperatively with EPA on the safe and timely completion of this work. EID s former East Chicago manufacturing facility was located adjacent to the site, and EID assigned responsibility for the site to us in the Separation Agreement. 
 78 

The Chemours Company 

 The USS Lead Superfund site was listed on the National Priorities List in 2009. To facilitate negotiations with PRPs, EPA divided the residential part of the USS Lead Superfund site into three zones, referred to as Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. The division into three zones resulted in Atlantic Richfield Co. Atlantic Richfield and EID entering into an agreement in 2014 with EPA and the State of Indiana to reimburse EPA s costs to implement clean-up in Zone 1 and Zone 3. In March 2017, we and three other parties Atlantic Richfield, EID, and the U.S. Metals Refining Co. U.S. Metals entered into an administrative order on consent to reimburse EPA s costs to clean-up a portion of Zone 2. In March 2018, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order for the remainder of the Zone 2 work to five parties, including us, Atlantic Richfield, EID, U.S. Metals, and USS Lead Muller Group, and these parties entered into an interim allocation agreement to perform that work. As of the end of 2019, the required work in Zone 3 had been completed, and Zone 2 was completed by the end of 2021. The determination of a final allocation for Zone 2 and/or the other Zones is ongoing, and additional PRPs may be identified. 
 
 The environmental accrual for USS Lead includes completion of the remaining obligations under the 2012 Record of Decision ROD and Statement of Work, which principally encompasses completion of Zone 1. The EPA released a proposed amendment to the 2012 ROD (the ROD Amendment for a portion of Zone 1 in December 2018 (following its August 2018 Feasibility Study Addendum), with its recommended option based on future residential use. The EPA s ROD Amendment for modified Zone 1 was released in March 2020, and selects as the preferred remedy one which requires a clean-up to residential standards based on the current applicable residential zoning. The ROD Amendment for modified Zone 1 also sets forth a selected contingent remedy which requires clean-up to commercial/industrial standards if the future land use becomes commercial/industrial. In November 2019, a Letter of Intent was executed by the City of East Chicago, Indiana and Industrial Development Advantage, LLC ("IDA"), relating to modified Zone 1 development, and EPA has indicated that it is more likely that future land use in this area will be commercial/industrial and not residential. 
 
 In 2021, we resolved the claims asserted by EPA related to past indirect costs associated with the 2012 ROD as amended, and the 2014 agreement entered into with EPA and the State of Indiana. In September 2022, EPA confirmed the selection of remedial actions for modified Zone 1 and provided notice to all relevant parties, including IDA, to cause the agreements between EPA, DOJ, the State of Indiana, us and other PRPs to become effective. We expect that our future costs relating to the USS Lead site will be contingent on implementation of these agreements, resolution of EPA s costs as well as any final allocation between PRPs. 
 
 Washington Works, Parkersburg, West Virginia Washington Works 
 
 The Washington Works complex is located on the eastern shore of the Ohio River south of Parkersburg, West Virginia. The facility encompasses approximately 400 acres, which were purchased by EID in the late 1940 s. Other nearby land parcels purchased by EID included Blennerhassett Island, and three separate properties where West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection ("WV DEP") permitted landfills were operated. Site operations began in 1948 and included the manufacture of nylon, filaments, and acrylics. In 1949, fluoropolymer manufacturing began, and in 1959, polyoxymethylene production was started. Landfill operations occurred from the 1960 s through the early 2000 s when all three were closed according to WV DEP approved closure plans. Beginning in 2014, EID no longer used PFOA as a polymerization aid to manufacture some fluoropolymer resins at Washington Works. 
 
 In July 2015, upon our separation from EID, we became the owner of the Washington Works complex. The site has implemented environmental investigations, including Verification Investigation in 1992 and RCRA Facility Investigation ("RFI") in 1999 pursuant to corrective action requirements of its RCRA Part B and HSWA Permit under EPA and the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources oversight. The RFI was approved in 2012, and a CMS was completed in 2015 that recommended certain remedial actions, including capping of the former on-site landfill and ponds, which had already been completed, sitewide groundwater hydraulic control, drinking water supply well treatment via granular activated carbon, and long-term groundwater monitoring. These actions were memorialized in a RCRA final remedy implementation plan approved by the agencies in 2018 and integrated into the updated RCRA permit in August 2020. 
 
 The remedial actions required by the RCRA final remedy implementation plan have been completed or are part of routine operations, maintenance and monitoring. Landfill post closure care includes systems to treat surface water, leachate or groundwater, landfill cover or cap maintenance, monitoring and reporting. Additionally, upgrades to the Local landfill cover are being developed. In December 2023, we entered into a voluntary Administrative Order on Consent with EPA under RCRA 3013(a) requiring monitoring, testing, analysis and reporting to complete a more comprehensive environmental assessment and site conceptual model of compounds found in soil and water at and around our manufacturing facility. This agreement is not based on any allegations of non-compliance, and it builds on the significant research Chemours and its predecessor have already done to advance knowledge of older legacy compounds around the site. Accruals related to these remedial actions were 26 million and 22 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Chemours Company 

 Chemours Washington Works discharges, through outfalls at the site, wastewater and stormwater pursuant to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permits issued by the WV DEP. In connection with actions being taken by us to comply with certain NPDES effluent limits, including for PFOA and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid, we submitted a permit modification to WV DEP relating to groundwater abatement for certain process water used at the facility, a temperature reduction project and realigning discharge flows to certain outfalls. In July 2021, EPA provided a specific objection to the draft modification based on Clean Water Act CWA regulations and requirements. In August 2021, WV DEP issued a NPDES permit modification to provide for the start-up of an abatement unit at the facility and to extend compliance dates for certain limits to December 2021 due to delays from the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, WV DEP issued a further NPDES modification, including for the operation of an abatement unit from the site s Ranney Well, and the site is taking additional actions to reduce PFAS discharges associated with wet weather flows and continuing to assess future stormwater discharges and permitting. In April 2023, we agreed to an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA that includes additional sampling as well as a compliance analysis and implementation of actions to address PFOA and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid HFPO Dimer Acid discharge exceedances that occurred following the outfall limits for these compounds that came into effect in January 2022. In August, 2023 we submitted an Alternatives Analysis and Implementation Plan consistent with the Administrative Order on Consent which is under EPA review. We expect to make future capital and other operating related expenditures at Washington Works in connection with this Consent Order. Additionally, effective September 1, 2024, a separate NDPES permit allows discharge of treated wastewater and non-contact cooling water from a new perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) processing line with an expiration date of July 2025 and allowing or a one-year renewal. 
 
 Further, pursuant to an Order on Consent ("OC"), entered into by EID with EPA since 2006, we provide alternate drinking water supplies, via granular activated carbon ("GAC") treatment or other approved supply, to residential well owners and local public drinking water systems near the Washington Works complex whose PFOA concentration exceeds 70 parts per trillion. We also provide regular sampling and GAC change outs activities as per OC requirements. Accruals related to this matter were 16 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were included in Accrued Litigation liability (see additional discussions under "Leach Settlement" in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements .) 
 
 New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Directives and Litigation 
 
 In March 2019, NJ DEP issued two Directives, one being a state-wide PFAS Directive, and filed four lawsuits against us and other defendants, including allegations relating to clean-up and removal costs at four sites including Chambers Works. In December 2021, a consolidated order was entered in the lawsuits granting, in part, and denying, in part a motion to dismiss or strike parts of the Second Amended Complaints. In January 2022, NJ DEP filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requiring EID and us to establish a remediation funding source RFS in the amount of 943 million for Chambers Works, the majority of which is for non-PFAS remediation items. Further discussion related to these matters is included in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements .

The Chemours Company 

 Climate Change 
 
 Our commitment to sustainability cannot be separated from our growth strategy or our vision and as a result, we aligned our sustainability focus and actions to the four key strategic pillars that support Chemours vision: Innovation and Sustainable Solutions, Environmental Leadership, Community Impact, and Greatest Place to Work for All. 
 
 The Environmental Leadership pillar underlines our commitment to deliver essential solutions responsibly, with a focus on the responsible treatment of climate, water, and waste. Our Environmental Leadership 2030 goals are comprised of the following: 
 60 reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute GHG emissions; 

99 or more reduction of air and water process emissions of fluorinated organic chemicals ("FOCs"); and, 

70 reduction in landfill volume intensity. 

In 2021, we updated our climate goals to better align our climate commitment with the Paris Accord and set us on a path to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 2050. In 2022, we signed a commitment with the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi to establish science-based targets for scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. In May 2024, the SBTi approved Chemours near-term science-based emissions reduction targets. This includes our existing 2030 goal of a 60 absolute reduction and a new Scope 3 target of reducing emissions by 25 per ton of product by 2030. 
 
 As part of the Innovation and Sustainable Solutions pillar, we are reimagining our portfolio to offer solutions that are also safer, healthier, and more resilient for a world that demands more. We believe that climate change is an important global issue that presents both opportunities and challenges for our company, our partners, our customers, and our communities. Climate change matters for our company are likely to be driven by changes in physical and transition risk, such as regulations and/or public policy, and changes in technology and product demand. Our operations and business results are increasingly subject to evolving climate-related legislation and regulations, inclusive of restrictions on GHG emissions, cap and trade emissions trading systems, and taxes on GHG emissions, fuel, and energy, among other provisions. Such regulatory matters have led, and are expected to continue to lead, to subsequent developments in product technology and demand. This helps guide our investment decisions and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, manufacturing technologies, and services that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. Our business segments conduct market trend impact assessments, continuously evaluate opportunities for existing and new products and are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from increased consumer demand for and/or legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of products and technologies necessary to achieve a low-carbon economy. 
 
 In our Thermal Specialized Solutions segment, global regulations driving the phase-down of HFCs, including the EU s F-Gas Directive, the EU s Mobile Air Conditioning Directive, and the AIM Act in the US, promote the adoption and sale of our high performing Opteon products, which have lower global warming potential ("GWP") and zero ozone-depletion footprint. Our Opteon portfolio has been developed to meet global regulations while maintaining or improving performance compared to the products they replace in refrigeration and cooling applications, such as food transportation, food and pharmaceutical/medical storage, food manufacturing and retail, automotive air conditioning, and residential and commercial building air conditioning. We are on track to achieve, by the end of 2025, our estimated goal that our low GWP products will result in 325 million tons of avoided emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents on a global basis. 
 
 We are a proponent of the AIM Act, that went into effect in 2022 and has begun the national phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons. We successfully completed an improvement project to significantly reduce emissions of HFC-23 at our Louisville, Kentucky manufacturing site. The project includes the design, custom-build and installation of proprietary technology to capture at least 99 of HFC-23 process emissions from the site. This project was operational as of October 2022 and validation of performance was completed prior to an extension period granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 In our Advanced Performance Materials segment, our growth prospects in fluoropolymers are also enhanced by regulation driving the increasing demand for electric vehicles and high-performance, low-emission vehicles. Our fluoropolymers are critical to delivering high performance over a wide range of harsh operating conditions, enhancing passenger safety, improving emission controls and fuel economy, and enabling vehicle electrification and the shift to hydrogen-powered vehicles. We expect the use of our fluoropolymers in vehicles to increase, driven by the automotive industry s trends toward energy efficiency and clean energy due to evolving emissions performance regulations and increasing adoption of electric vehicles. Our fluoropolymer technology supports growing market demand for clean hydrogen generation using water electrolyzers, energy storage in flow batteries, and hydrogen conversion to power fuel cell vehicles. 
 
 In our Titanium Technologies business, our Ti-Pure Sustainability ("TS") product series, is designed to advance our customers sustainability goals. The product series includes enhanced product sustainability designations including climate impact, circularity, resource efficiency, and health and wellness. Going forward, our product portfolio will continue to be centered on the evolving needs of our customers.

The Chemours Company 

 As an energy and emissions intensive company, our costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal and external voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may change and could become more stringent over time, which could result in significant additional compliance costs, increased costs of purchased energy or other raw materials, increased transportation costs, investments in, or restrictions on, our operations, installation or modification of GHG-emitting equipment, or additional costs associated with GHG emissions. Additionally, significant regional or national differences in approaches to the imposition of such regulations and restrictions could present competitive challenges or opportunities in a global marketplace. Currently, most of our global operating facilities are required to monitor and report their GHG emissions but may or may not be subject to programs requiring trading or emission controls. The EU Emission Trading System applies to our operating sites in that region. Furthermore, U.S. political administration could lead to additional federal regulation with respect to GHG emissions limits and/or other legislation that could impact our operations. By tracking and taking action to reduce our GHG emissions footprint through energy efficiency programs, increased use of renewable energy and focused GHG emissions reduction programs, we can decrease the potential future impact of these regulatory matters. 

PFOA 
 
 See our discussion under the heading PFOA in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements . 

GenX 
 
 In June 2019, the Member States Committee of the European Chemicals Agency ECHA voted to list HFPO Dimer Acid as a Substance of Very High Concern. The vote was based on Article 57(f) equivalent level of concern having probable serious effects to the environment. This identification does not impose immediate regulatory restriction or obligations but may lead to a future authorization or restriction of the substance. On September 24, 2019, we filed an application with the EU Court of Justice for the annulment of the decision of ECHA to list HFPO Dimer Acid as a Substance of Very High Concern. In February 2022, the General Court dismissed the annulment action, and we have appealed such decision. In November 2023, the EU Court of Justice dismissed our appeal. 

PFAS 
 
 Refer to our discussion under the heading "PFAS" in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 
 In May 2020, ECHA announced that five Member States (Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) launched a call for evidence to inform a PFAS restriction proposal to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market and use of PFAS in the EU. In this regulatory process, more than 4,000 substances, including fluorinated-gases ("F-gases") and fluoropolymers are being considered as part of this broad regulatory action. Companies producing or using PFAS, as well as selling mixture or products containing PFAS, were invited to provide input. This call for evidence closed July 31, 2020. Thousands of substances meet the definition of PFAS as outlined in the call for evidence. This very broad definition covers substances with a variety of physical and chemical properties, health and environmental profiles, uses, and benefits. We submitted information on the substances covered by the call for evidence to the Member State competent authority for Germany, which is the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health BAuA ). On July 15, 2021, the countries submitted their restriction proposal, which informs ECHA of the intent to prepare a PFAS restriction dossier for fluorinated substances within a defined structural formula scope, including branched fluoroalkyl groups and substances containing ether linkages, fluoropolymers and side chain fluorinated polymers. The restriction dossier was submitted to ECHA in January 2023, and in February 2023 ECHA published a report and supporting annexes on the restriction proposal, which includes identified concerns for in-scope PFAS and their degradation products and the proposed restriction of a full ban with certain use-specific time-limited derogation periods. Comments were submitted from individuals and organizations during the consultation period in 2023 and the restriction dossier will be reviewed by the ECHA Risk Assessment Committee ("RAC") and Socio-economic Analysis Committees SEAC ). RAC and SEAC will focus on the different sectors that may be affected and elements of the proposal, and further meetings will be held in November 2024 and 2025. The five national authorities who prepared the proposal are also updating their initial report to address the consultation comments, which will then be assessed by the ECHA committees. The estimated earliest entry into force of restrictions is 2026, contingent upon timely completion of the remaining steps in the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals REACH restriction process.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because of our global operations. As a result, we have assets, liabilities, and cash flows denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. We also have variable rate indebtedness, which subjects us to interest rate risk. Additionally, we are also exposed to changes in the prices of certain commodities that we use in production. Changes in these rates and commodity prices may have an impact on our future cash flows and earnings. We manage these risks through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 By using derivative financial instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs, and reflect the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, thus creating a receivable risk for us. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. We minimize counterparty credit (or repayment) risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit ratings. 
 
 Our risk management programs, and the underlying exposures are closely correlated, such that the potential loss in value for the risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by the changes in the value of the underlying exposures. Refer to Note 22 Financial Instruments to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

Foreign Currency Risks 
 
 We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the volatility in our earnings related to foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasuring our monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in non-functional currencies, and any gains and losses from the foreign currency forward contracts are intended to be offset by any gains or losses from the remeasurement of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are stand-alone and, except as described below, have not been designated as a hedge. At September 30, 2024, we had 9 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent of 153 million, the fair value of which amounted to less than 1 million. At December 31, 2023, we had 12 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent of 252 million, the fair value of which amounted to less than negative 1 million. We recognized a net gain of 1 million and a net loss of 5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net losses of 1 million and 8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, within other income, net related to our non-designated foreign currency forward contracts. 
 
 We enter into certain qualifying foreign currency forward contracts under a cash flow hedge program to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in the euro against the U.S. dollar for forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. At September 30, 2024, we had 182 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding under our cash flow hedge program with an aggregate notional U.S. dollar equivalent of 214 million, the fair value of which amounted to negative 3 million. At December 31, 2023, we had 176 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding under our cash flow hedge program with an aggregate notional U.S. dollar equivalent of 203 million, the fair value of which amounted to negative 2 million. We recognized a pre-tax loss of 6 million and a pre-tax gain of 1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and pre-tax gains of 7 million and 5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1 million and 2 million of gain were reclassified to the cost of goods sold from accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 1 million of loss and 5 million of gain were reclassified to the cost of goods sold from accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively. 
 
 We designated our euro-denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. We recognized pre-tax losses of 38 million and 11 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and pre-tax gains of 35 million and 13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, on our net investment hedge within accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 83 

The Chemours Company 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We entered into interest rate swaps, to mitigate the volatility in our cash payments for interest due to fluctuations in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), as is applicable to the portion of our senior secured term loan facility denominated in U.S. dollars. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had two interest rate swaps outstanding under our cash flow hedge program with an aggregate notional U.S. dollar equivalent of 300 million, the fair value of which amounted to negative 8 million and negative 7 million, respectively. We recognized pre-tax losses of 6 million and less than 1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive loss. No pre-tax gains or losses were recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, less than 1 million and 1 million of gain was reclassified to interest expense, net from accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 0 million and 4 million of gain was reclassified to interest expense, net from accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2023. These material weaknesses and remediation status as of September 30, 2024 are described below. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These controls and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO, together with management, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, the CEO and CFO have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for each of the periods presented.

The Chemours Company 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 The following material weaknesses had been identified as of December 31, 2023: 
 We did not design and maintain an effective control environment as senior management failed to set an appropriate tone at the top. Specifically, among other things, there was a lack of transparency with the Company s board of directors by former senior management regarding efforts to delay payments to certain vendors and to accelerate the collection of receivables, and that these individuals engaged in these efforts in part to meet free cash flow targets that the Company had communicated publicly, and which also would be a part of a key metric for determining incentive compensation applicable to both executive officers and to employees. As a result, it was concluded that former senior management violated the Company s Code of Ethics applicable to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Controller. The ineffective control environment contributed to the following additional material weaknesses: 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls related to the information and communication component of the COSO Framework, and principles of internally communicating information, including objectives and responsibilities for internal control, necessary to support the functioning of internal control. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure appropriate communication between certain functions within the Company, including (i) the identification and communication of certain contractual arrangements and (ii) communication of business developments which impact key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment assessment. This material weakness related to information and communication contributed to an additional material weakness in that we did not design and maintain effective controls regarding the evaluation and escalation of reports made through the Chemours Ethics Hotline, including controls regarding the escalation of certain reports to the General Counsel and Chair of the Audit Committee. 
 
 Additionally, we did not design and maintain effective controls to prevent or timely detect unauthorized changes to our vendor master files in order to prevent unauthorized cash disbursements. 
 These material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements of the Company s financial statements or disclosures but did result in immaterial revisions to our March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 financial statements and a revision to the Company s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the Company s Statement of Cash Flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, the material weaknesses described above could lead to a misstatement of substantially all account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
 
 Management previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report and our Quarterly Reports in 2024 the following control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls regarding the evaluation and escalation of reports made through the Chemours Ethics Hotline, including controls regarding the escalation of certain reports to the General Counsel and Chair of the Audit Committee. 

We did not design and maintain effective controls to prevent or timely detect unauthorized changes to our vendor master files in order to prevent unauthorized cash disbursements. 

We have established a Project Management Office PMO to monitor progress towards remediation and have also engaged external legal, accounting, financial and other consulting, and professional services firms to assist senior management in the development and execution of a comprehensive remediation program. Management developed a comprehensive workplan for remediation of the material weaknesses. This workplan included the following: 
 Ethics and Compliance Reporting 
 With respect to maintaining effective controls regarding the evaluation and escalation of reports made through the Chemours Ethics Hotline, including controls regarding the escalation of certain reports to the General Counsel and Chair of the Audit Committee, the Company has reassessed and redesigned certain elements of its processes and procedures. The Company retained the services of an external firm to assist the Company in its efforts in the design, implementation, and interim supervision of the ethics and compliance aspects of the remediation program, as well as supporting the day-to day operations of the Ethics Compliance function, as a result of the retirement of the Company s former Chief Ethics Compliance Officer. The Company hired its new Chief Compliance and Enterprise Risk Management Officer effective September 16, 2024. 
 85 

The Chemours Company 

 The Company has modified its policies, processes, and procedures with respect to managing, investigating, and closing ethics complaints, including establishing processes for the escalation of matters involving Section 16 Officers to the General Counsel and Audit Committee Chair. Additionally, if a complaint implicates the General Counsel, the Chief Audit Executive and the Chair of the Audit Committee will be notified. The Company s Investigations Policy outlines the key principles to be applied including objectivity, thoroughness, professionalism, confidentiality and timeliness, and the accompanying Ethics Hotline Investigations Procedures outlines expectations for each step of the investigation process including roles and responsibilities, case intake, investigation planning and execution, and final resolution, documentation, and communication to relevant stakeholders. Additionally, the Company has provided training on the Investigations Policy and Ethics Hotline Investigations Procedures to those who conduct investigations. 
 The Company published both internally and externally a new Speak Up Policy, which reinforced every employee s responsibility to raise concerns and outlines the numerous avenues available to report potential issues. Additionally, the Company provided mandatory training on the new Speak Up Policy to all employees worldwide. 
 Through these efforts, the Company implemented its plan to remediate the previously identified material weakness related to the evaluation and escalation of reports made through the Chemours Ethics Hotline. 
 Vendor Master Files 
 With respect to designing and maintaining effective controls related to preventing or detecting unauthorized changes to our vendor master files, the Company has completed its enhancements of our policies, procedures, workflows, and training as it relates to the controls over verification of vendor master file changes with vendor contacts to prevent unauthorized cash disbursements. Specifically, the Company has enhanced its controls and workflow as it relates to the verification of vendor master file bank account changes with vendor contacts. 
 Through the efforts described above, the Company was able to implement its plan to remediate the previously identified material weakness related to its vendor master file bank account changes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remediation measures described above have been implemented and we have had sufficient time to test the operating effectiveness and remediate the two material weaknesses noted above and, as such, the material weaknesses identified in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to Ethics and Compliance Reporting and Vendor Master files have been remediated. 
 
 Status of Remediation Efforts for the Unremediated Material Weaknesses 

With respect to the material weaknesses related to the failure to set an appropriate tone at the top and failure to design and maintain effective controls related to the information and communication component of the COSO Framework, the Company has made the following enhancements to our internal control over financial reporting: 
 On February 28, 2024, our board of directors placed former President and Chief Executive Officer, former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer on administrative leave pending completion of the Audit Committee Internal Review; 

On February 28, 2024, our board of directors appointed Denise Dignam as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Matthew Abbott as Interim Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), and subsequently appointed Denise Dignam as President and Chief Executive Officer on March 22, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the Company announced it had appointed Shane Hostetter as Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), effective July 1, 2024. On July 25, 2024, the Company announced it had appointed David Will as Chief Accounting Officer and Controller (principal accounting officer), effective August 12, 2024; 

Senior leadership has held multiple "All Hands" meetings in 2024 with employees, including holding Global Town Halls immediately following the issuance of the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Additionally, senior leadership has disseminated company-wide and team-specific communications to explain the material weaknesses, extract key learnings for leaders, and emphasize our commitment to our core values, specifically Integrity; 

The Compensation Committee has revised key metrics used in the determination of executive and employees' incentive compensation starting in 2024; 

Provided updated training on internal control over financial reporting and requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including training courses on applicable federal securities laws for senior management, and training courses on ethics for finance professionals; 

Reinforced the Company s expectation of ethical business practices via the annual, company-wide Ethics Compliance training to educate executives and employees on our Code of Conduct, certify compliance, and outline the specific behaviors expected to fulfill our Integrity core value; 

86 

The Chemours Company 

 Enhanced our internal management representation letter process which serves as a mechanism for internal information sharing and supports, in part, our CEO s and CFO s certifications and accuracy of our financial statements. The Company has also provided mandatory training to respondents to facilitate the receipt of complete and accurate information; 

Enhanced our Disclosure Committee process; 

Enhanced our policies and protocols related to working capital management practices, including enhancing our communication of working capital management practices to our board of directors; 

Enhanced our process around the verification of physical assets including enhancing communication of changes in the existence, operating status or impairment assessment of physical assets; 

Completed a company-wide Ethics Compliance survey to inform our continued efforts in advancing our culture of ethics and compliance; 

Executed a refresh of our corporate values and continued to disseminate company-wide and team-specific communications to emphasize our commitment to our core values, specifically Integrity; and 

Provided updated training for certain accounting, finance, and legal employees to ensure that relevant information is appropriately communicated to personnel involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 

In addition to the above completed actions, we are in the process of designing and implementing the following enhancements to our internal control over financial reporting: 
 Executing the recommendations of the Audit Committee s independent outside counsel related to Tone at the Top and Information and Communication as adopted and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors; 

Enhancing our controls, policies, procedures, and training as it relates to timely and accurate communication and information sharing, including enhancing key controls concerning information communicated and used in determining the accounting for significant transactions, contracting, and business developments which impact key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment assessment; 

Providing additional training for employees and members of management, specifically in accounting, finance, and legal, to ensure that relevant information is appropriately communicated to personnel involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures; and 

Conducting additional training for employees regarding the importance of the Company establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, for information to be appropriately communicated to all relevant personnel involved in the preparation of our financial statements and disclosures. 

Changes to internal control over financial reporting require operation for a sufficient period of time in order for management to evaluate and test the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these changes for a sufficient period of time prior to concluding that these controls are designed and operating effectively, and the material weaknesses can be considered remediated. The Company s internal audit function is assessing and implementing procedures to monitor these updated processes. 
 
 As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify the remediation actions described above. We anticipate that the foregoing efforts and enhanced internal control over financial reporting, when implemented and tested for a sufficient period of time, will remediate the material weaknesses as described above. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, product liability, intellectual property, personal injury, commercial, contractual, employment, governmental, environmental and regulatory, anti-trust, and other such matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we, by virtue of our status as a subsidiary of EID prior to the Separation, are subject to or required under the Separation-related agreements executed prior to the Separation to indemnify EID against various pending legal proceedings. Information regarding certain of these matters is set forth below and in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements . In the foregoing, we have excluded matters that we expect to result in sanctions of less than 1 million, if any. 

Litigation 
 
 PFOA and PFAS: Environmental and Litigation Proceedings 
 
 For purposes of this report, the term PFOA means, collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt, and does not distinguish between the two forms. The term PFAS means per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Information related to these, and other litigation matters, is included in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Environmental Proceedings 
 
 Dordrecht, Netherlands 
 
 In May 2020, we were notified of an alleged criminal offense related to the Netherlands Environmental Management Act and the Working Conditions Decree, regarding the use of PFOA during the pre-spin time period of June 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012. The investigation was initiated in the first quarter of 2016 by a public prosecutor. We believe that we have complied with all relevant laws, and we are in contact with the prosecutor. 
 
 In addition, in March 2022, the public prosecutor in The Netherlands has raised a matter related to an alleged infraction of Regulation (EU) 517/2014. Due to a reporting error, our Dordrecht Works facility exceeded its allocated or transferred quota of hydrofluorocarbons within the European market over several years. We implemented improvements to our reporting procedures and operated within the allocated quota. We paid a fine in the fourth quarter of 2022. On October 31, 2024, we received a request from the Dutch ILT agency to amend our F-gas reporting for certain years to reflect HFCs produced and consumed or destroyed at the Dordrecht Works facility. The agency asserts that under Regulation (EU) 2024/573, which repealed and replaced Regulation 517/2014 in February 2024, such compounds are subject to the F-gas quota system. The Company is reviewing the assertion and believes it is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this matter or to estimate the loss or range of loss, if any, as the matter is in its early stages with significant issues to be evaluated. 
 
 Fayetteville, North Carolina 
 
 In February 2019, we received a Notice of Violation NOV from EPA alleging certain TSCA violations at Fayetteville. Matters raised in the NOV could have the potential to affect operations at Fayetteville. For this NOV, we responded to EPA in March 2019. We are in discussion with EPA regarding PFAS-related allegations at our sites, including the February 2019 NOV, and at this time management believes that a loss is possible but not estimable. We have also received NOVs from the NC DEQ following entry of the CO, including in April 2020, January 2021, and August 2021, alleging violations relating to Fayetteville. We have responded to these matters and in April 2022 entered into a settlement agreement with NC DEQ with respect to the August 2021 NOV. We do not believe that a loss is probable related to the matters in the other NOVs. Further discussion related to these matters is included under the heading Fayetteville Works, Fayetteville, North Carolina in Note 18 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements .

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Except for the updated risk factors set forth below relating to environmental matters, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 If our long-lived assets, including goodwill, become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 
 
 We may be required to record a significant non-cash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. We have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on October 1 of each year, or more frequently if required. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, changes in the industrial, economic, political, social, and physical landscapes in which we operate, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, changes in discount rate, as well as competition or other factors leading to a reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. Subsequent to year end, after the announcement of the Audit Committee Internal Review, we experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price. A sustained decline in our stock price in the future could indicate the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we concluded a triggering event was present for our Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit and associated goodwill, as well as the related asset group. As a result of the interim quantitative goodwill impairment analysis performed, we concluded the carrying amount of the Advanced Performance Materials reporting unit exceeded its fair value, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 56 million. There can be no assurance that future events or conditions may not result in an impairment to any of our other reporting units' goodwill or to any of our long-lived assets. 
 
 We are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that may result in unanticipated loss or liability related to our current and past operations, and that may result in significant additional compliance costs or obligations, which in either case, could reduce our profitability or liquidity. 
 
 Our operations and production facilities are dependent upon attainment and renewal of requisite operating permits and are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws, regulations, and enforcements, proceedings or other actions at national, international, and local levels in numerous jurisdictions, relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, storing and disposing of hazardous wastes, and product content and other safety or human rights concerns. Such laws include, but are not limited to: 
 U.S.-based regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA , often referred to as Superfund ), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and similar state and global laws for management and remediation of hazardous materials, the Clean Air Act CAA and Clean Water Act CWA and similar state and global laws for the protection of air and water resources, and the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA 

Foreign-based chemical control regulations, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals REACH in the EU, the Chemical Substances Control Law CSCL in Japan, MEP Order No. 7 in China, and the Toxic Chemical Substance Control Act TCSCA in Taiwan for the production and distribution of chemicals in commerce and reporting of potential adverse effects; 

The EU Emissions Trading System and similar local and global laws for regulating GHG emissions; and, 

Numerous local, state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and enforcements governing materials transport and packaging. 

If we are found to be in violation of these laws, regulations, or enforcements, which may be subject to change based on legislative, scientific, or other factors, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, reputational harm, loss of sales or market access, or experience interruptions in our operations. Our operations and production may also be subject to changes based on increased regulation or other changes to, or restrictions imposed by, any such additional regulations. Any operational interruptions or plant shutdowns may result in delays in production or may cause us to incur additional costs to develop redundancies in order to avoid interruptions in our production cycles. In addition, the manner in which adopted regulations (including environmental and safety regulations) are ultimately implemented may affect our products, the demand for and public perception of our products, the reputation of our brands, our market access, and our results of operations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use or chemicals we produce, we could incur material costs to address the consequences of such event and future reputational costs associated with any such event. 
 89 

The Chemours Company 

 Our costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal and external voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may change and could become more stringent over time, which could result in significant additional compliance costs, increased costs of purchased energy or other raw materials, increased transportation costs, investments in, or restrictions on, our operations, installation or modification of emission control equipment, or additional costs associated with emissions control equipment. As a result of our current and historic operations, including the operations of divested businesses and certain discontinued operations, we also expect to continue to incur costs for environmental investigation and remediation activities at a number of our current or former sites and third-party disposal locations. However, the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to accurately predict. While we establish accruals in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), the ultimate actual costs and liabilities may vary from the accruals because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors (many of which are outside of our control), including the nature of the matter and any associated third-party claims, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties PRPs at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other PRPs. We also could incur significant additional costs as a result of additional contamination that is discovered or remedial obligations imposed in the future. Refer to Environmental Matters within Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 22 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We also could incur significant additional costs as a result of additional contamination that is discovered or remedial obligations imposed in the future. 
 
 As discussed in Note 22 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we continue to have active dialogue with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality NC DEQ and other stakeholders regarding potential remedies that are both economically and technologically feasible to achieve the objectives of the Consent Order CO and Addendum Addendum related to the discharge of HFPO Dimer Acid and PFAS from Fayetteville into the Cape Fear River, site surface water, groundwater, and air emissions. The Addendum establishes the procedure to implement specified remedial measures for reducing PFAS loadings from Fayetteville to the Cape Fear River, including construction of a barrier wall with a groundwater extraction system. The estimated liabilities of achieving the CO and Addendum objectives consist of several components, each of which may vary significantly and may exceed the recorded reserve estimates, which could be material. 
 
 There is also a risk that one or more of our manufacturing processes, key raw materials, or products may be found to have, or be characterized or perceived as having, a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees or unregulated emissions, which could potentially result in us incurring liability in connection with such characterization and the associated effects of any toxicological or health-related impact. If such a discovery or characterization occurs, we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation. In addition, the relevant materials or products, including products of our customers incorporating our materials or products, may be recalled, phased-out, or banned. Changes in laws, science, or regulations, or their interpretations, and our customers perception of such changes or interpretations may also affect the marketability of certain of our products. 
 
 In June 2019, the Member States Committee of the European Chemicals Agency ("ECHA") also voted to list HFPO Dimer Acid as a Substance of Very High Concern. The vote was based on Article 57(f) equivalent level of concern having probable serious effects to the environment. This identification does not impose immediate regulatory restriction or obligations but may lead to a future authorization or restriction of the substance. In September 2019, we filed an application with the EU Court of Justice for the annulment of the decision of ECHA to list HFPO Dimer Acid as a Substance of Very High Concern. In February 2022, the General Court dismissed the annulment action, and we appealed such decision. In November 2023, the EU Court of Justice dismissed our appeal. 
 
 In May 2020, five European countries began an initiative to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market and use of PFAS in the EU. In this regulatory process, more than 4,000 substances, including F-gases and fluoropolymers are being considered for potential broad regulatory action. On July 15, 2021, the countries submitted their restriction proposal, which informed ECHA of the intent to prepare a PFAS restriction dossier for fluorinated substances within a defined structural formula scope, including branched fluoroalkyl groups and substances containing ether linkages, fluoropolymers and side chain fluorinated polymers. The restriction dossier was submitted to ECHA in January 2023, and in February 2023 ECHA published a report and supporting annexes on the restriction proposal, which includes identified concerns for in-scope PFAS and their degradation products and the proposed restriction of a full ban with certain use-specific time-limited derogation periods. Comments were submitted from individuals and organizations during the consultation period in 2023 and the restriction dossier will be reviewed by the ECHA Risk Assessment Committee ("RAC") and Socio-economic Analysis Committees SEAC ). RAC and SEAC will focus on the different sectors that are affected and elements of the proposal, and further meetings will be held in November 2024 and 2025. The five national authorities who prepared the proposal are also updating their initial report to address the consultation comments, which will then be assessed by ECHA committees. The estimated earliest entry into force of restrictions is 2026, contingent upon timely completion of the remaining steps in the EU REACH restriction process. 
 
 In January of 2024, the European Council adopted a regulation supporting the phase down of hydrofluorocarbons HFC by 2050 and multiple bans on HFCs and hydrofluoroolefin HFO in select applications. The new regulation entered into force on March 11, 2024, and includes both reviews and exemptions. No later than January 1, 2030, the European Commission will publish a report on the effects of the regulation and whether the bans are upheld based on technical feasibility and socioeconomic impact of alternatives. 
 90 

The Chemours Company 

In March 2024, ECHA published a registration update for trifluoroacetic acid TFA ). This update includes a self-classification, by TFA registrants, of Category 2 Reprotoxin. In parallel, Germany has announced its intention to submit a proposal to revise the existing harmonized (legally binding) classification to include reprotoxicity. The proposal will go through a 60-day consultation period to collect comments from interested parties. Next, ECHA s RAC will review the submission and all comments and adopt an opinion, which could take up to 18 months. Based on this opinion, the European Commission will prepare a legislative proposal in conjunction with Member State experts. If Member States and the European Parliament do not object, the final harmonized classification will then become legally binding after a transition period. There are many variables in this process, which could take years to complete. 
 
 The impacts of these various restrictions and regulatory measures in the EU as noted above, individually and in the aggregate, could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 
 In October 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap, identifying a comprehensive approach to addressing PFAS. The PFAS Strategic Roadmap sets timelines by which EPA plans to take specific actions through 2024, including establishing a national primary drinking water regulation ("NPDWR") for PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid PFOS and taking Effluent Limitations Guidelines actions to regulate PFAS discharges from industrial categories among other actions. As provided under its roadmap, EPA also released its National PFAS Testing Strategy, under which the agency will identify and select certain PFAS compounds for which it will require manufacturers to conduct testing pursuant to TSCA section 4. We have received various test orders and have formed consortia to jointly manage compliance with the test order requirements. We expect to receive future test orders, however the timing of the remaining TSCA orders is not determinable at this time. Additional costs could be incurred in connection with EPA's actions, which could be material. The draft Effluent Limitations Guidelines for PFAS manufacturers as announced in the PFAS Strategic Roadmap is now expected to be proposed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Also in October 2021, EPA published a final toxicity assessment for GenX compounds that decreased the draft reference dose for GenX compounds based on EPA s review of new studies and analyses. On March 18, 2022, we filed a petition to EPA requesting to withdraw and correct its toxicity assessment for GenX compounds, and this petition was denied by EPA on June 14, 2022. The next day, on June 15, 2022, EPA released health advisories for four PFAS, including interim updated lifetime drinking water health advisories for PFOA and PFOS, and final health advisories for GenX compounds, including HFPO Dimer Acid and another PFAS compound (PFBS). On July 13, 2022, we filed a Petition for Review of the GenX compounds health advisory. In July 2024, the Third Circuit dismissed the Company s petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding the health advisory was not a final agency action. 
 
 In March 2023, EPA proposed a NPDWR to establish Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL s) for six PFAS, with PFOA and PFOS having MCLs as individual compounds (each proposed as 4 parts per trillion ("ppt")) and four other PFAS compounds, including HFPO Dimer Acid, having a hazard index approach limit on any mixture containing one or more of the compounds. The proposed PFAS NPDWR was subject to public comment through May 30, 2023, and on April 10, 2024 EPA issued its final rule, which included promulgating individual MCLs for PFOA and PFOS at 4ppt and individual MCLs for PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA at 10ppt. In addition, EPA finalized a hazard index of 1 (unitless) as the MCL for any mixture of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA and PFBS . The final rule became effective 60 days from publication in the Federal Register and the compliance date for public water systems in the U.S. to meet the MCLs is five years from the publication date. In June 2024, Chemours, as well as other organizations including the American Water Works Association and the American Chemistry Council, filed petitions for review of the final rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Also in April 2024, EPA issued a final rule designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, which has also been challenged in the same appeals court. Depending on the ultimate outcome of EPA s actions, our estimated environmental remediation liabilities and accrued litigation could increase to meet any new drinking water standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by business disruptions, including environmental, weather, and natural disasters. 
 
 We and certain of our customers and suppliers have experienced business and/or supply chain disruptions, plant downtime, power outages, and other disruptions, caused by, among other things, environmental and natural disaster incidents. The nature of our business dictates that we maintain significant concentrations of physical assets, many of which are large users of water, in geographic locations which may be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including weather or geological events or natural disasters, such as, but not limited to, hurricanes, earthquakes, flood, prolonged droughts or wild fires (whether as a result of climate change or otherwise), significant changes in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, increasing atmospheric and water temperatures, and rising sea levels. Such events could also seriously harm our operations, as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers, and accordingly, we continue to study the long-term implications of changing climate parameters on plant siting, operational issues, and water availability. For example, in June 2024, we had to temporarily pause production at our Altamira Titanium Dioxide manufacturing facility in Mexico for approximately three weeks due to severe drought conditions. We may experience similar type disruptions in the future, which could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in the future. 
 
 91 

The Chemours Company 

 Preparedness plans pertaining to the physical aspects of our business have been developed with detailed actions needed in the event of unforeseen events or severe weather. We also engineer our facilities to better withstand these events and hold insurance coverage to protect against losses from physical damages and related business interruptions. These measures have historically been in place, and such activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective for a particular event that we may experience. 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 2022 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On April 27, 2022, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of shares of our issued and outstanding common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed 750 million, plus any associated fees or costs in connection with our share repurchase activity (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program ). Under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, shares of our common stock can be purchased in the open market from time to time, subject to management s discretion, as well as general business and market conditions. Our 2022 Share Repurchase Program became effective on April 27, 2022 and is scheduled to continue through the earlier of its expiration on December 31, 2025 or the completion of repurchases up to the approved amount. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 
 Through September 30, 2024, we purchased a cumulative 10,342,722 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, which amounted to 309 million at an average share price of 29.90 per share. There were no share repurchases under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The aggregate amount of our common stock that remained available for purchase under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program at September 30, 2024 was 441 million, though we do not anticipate additional repurchases under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. 

Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Information regarding mine safety and other regulatory actions at our surface mines and/or mineral sands separation facilities in Starke, Florida, Jesup, Georgia, Nahunta, Georgia, and Offerman, Georgia, are included in Exhibit 95 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
