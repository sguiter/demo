 centers located in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Our centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders. Our services include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, diagnostic radiology (X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our reportable segments to combine our eRad business, which was included in the Imaging Center segment, with our AI segment to form a new Digital Health reportable segment. Prior period amounts were adjusted retrospectively to reflect the change in reportable segment. For further financial information about these segments, see Note 5, Segment Reporting. 
 
 In March 2024, we closed on a public offering of shares of our common stock, including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of an underwriter's overallotment option, at a price to the public of per share. The gross proceeds as a result of this public offering was million before underwriting discounts, commissions, and costs totaling million. 
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RadNet, Inc as well as its subsidiaries in which RadNet has a controlling financial interest. The consolidated financial statements also include certain variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary (as described in more detail below). All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. All of these affiliated entities are referred to collectively as RadNet, we, us, our or the Company in this report. 
 Accounting regulations stipulate that generally any entity with a) insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties, or b) equity holders that, as a group, lack the characteristics which evidence a controlling financial interest, is considered a Variable Interest Entity VIE ). We consolidate all VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a qualitative analysis that identifies which variable interest holder has the controlling financial interest in the VIE. The variable interest holder who has both of the following has the controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In performing our analysis, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the design and activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the VIE has entered into, the nature of the VIE s variable interests issued and how they were negotiated with or marketed to potential investors, and which parties participated significantly in the design or redesign of the entity. 
 
 VIEs that we consolidate as the primary beneficiary include professional corporations which are owned or controlled by individuals within our senior management and provide professional medical services for centers in Arizona, California, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. These VIEs are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Medical Group". RadNet provides non-medical, technical and administrative services to the Consolidated Medical Group for which it receives a management fee, pursuant to the related management agreements. Through the management agreements we have exclusive authority over all non-medical decision making related to the ongoing business operations and we determine the annual budget. The Consolidated Medical Group has insignificant operating assets and liabilities, and de minimis equity. Substantially all cash flows of the Consolidated Medical Group after expenses, including professional salaries, are transferred to us. We consolidate the revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Medical Group. The creditors of the Consolidated Medical Group do not have recourse to our general credit and there are no other arrangements that could expose us to losses on behalf of the Consolidated Medical Group. However, RadNet may be required to provide financial support to cover any operating expenses in excess of operating revenues. 
 
 The Consolidated Medical Group on a combined basis recognized million and million of revenue, net of management services fees to RadNet, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and million and million of operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. RadNet recognized million and million of total billed net service fee revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, for management services provided to the Consolidated Medical Group relating primarily to the technical portion of billed revenue.

 million of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. RadNet recognized million and million of total billed net service fee revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, for management services provided to the Consolidated Medical Group relating primarily to the technical portion of billed revenue. 
 
 In our condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have included approximately million and million, respectively, of accounts receivable and approximately million and million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the Consolidated Medical Group, respectively. The cash flows of the Consolidated Medical Group are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 At all of our centers not serviced by the Consolidated Medical Group we have entered into long-term contracts with medical groups to provide professional services at those centers, including supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures. The medical groups maintain full control over the physicians they employ. Through our management agreements, we make available to the medical groups the imaging centers, including all furniture, fixtures and medical equipment therein. The medical groups are compensated for their services from the professional component of the global net service fee revenue and after deducting management service fees paid to us, we have no economic controlling interest in these medical groups. As such, the financial results of these groups are not consolidated in our financial statements. 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements; however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been made. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Total amortization expense was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful life determined at acquisition. Management service contracts are amortized over years using the straight line method.

 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") announced an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 . Subsequently, multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to support certain components of Pillar Two Model Rules beginning 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. The model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two Model Rules slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar Two Model Rules. On a long-term basis, we will continue to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in all countries applicable to us. For 2024, we expect that we will meet one or more transactional safe harbor rules, and as such, we do not believe Pillar Two model will have an impact on our annual effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 We recorded an income tax expense of million, or an effective tax rate of , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million, or an effective tax rate of for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded income tax expense of million, or an effective tax rate of , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million, or an effective tax rate of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 diverge from the federal statutory rate due to (i) effects of state income taxes ; (ii) officer's compensation limitations; (iii) partial valuation allowance on losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by (iv) excess tax benefits attributable to share based compensation; and (v) noncontrolling interests from controlled partnerships.

We have reserved shares of common stock for issuance under the Restated Plan which can be issued in the form of incentive and/or nonstatutory stock options, restricted and/or unrestricted stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights. Terms and conditions of awards can be direct grants or based on achieving a performance metric. We also consider probability of achievement of performance conditions when determining expense recognition. For the awards where vesting is probable, equity-based compensation is recognized over the related vesting period. Stock options generally vest over to and expire to from date of grant. We determine the compensation expense for each stock option award using the Black Scholes model. This model requires that our management make certain estimates concerning risk free interest rates and volatility in the trading price of our common stock. The compensation expense recognized for all equity-based awards is recognized over the awards service periods. Equity-based compensation is classified in operating expenses within the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees. In connection with our acquisition of DeepHealth Inc. on June 1, 2020, we assumed the DeepHealth, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, including outstanding options awards that can be exercised for our common stock. No additional awards will be granted under the DeepHealth, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. See Note 7, Stock-Based Compensation, for more information.

 CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION - 
 The HLH Imaging Group Limited fka Heart and Lung Imaging Limited 
 On November 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of of the equity interests of Heart and Lung Imaging Limited. The purchase included up to million in contingent milestone consideration and cash holdback of million to be issued months after acquisition subject to adjustment for any indemnification claims, which will be adjusted to fair value in subsequent periods. The holdback had a value of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The contingent consideration is determined by the achievement of a specific number of physician reads. On September 20, 2023, we settled a milestone contingent liability by issuing shares of our common stock at an ascribed value of million and cash of million. On December 12, 2023, we settled a milestone contingent liability by issuing shares of our common stock at an ascribed value of million and cash of million.

 unconsolidated joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from to . These joint ventures represent partnerships with hospitals, health systems or radiology practices and were formed for the purpose of owning and operating diagnostic imaging centers. Professional services at the joint venture diagnostic imaging centers are performed by contracted radiology practices or a radiology practice that participates in the joint venture. Our investment in these joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method, since RadNet does not have a controlling interest in such ventures. We evaluate our investment in joint ventures, including cost in excess of book value (equity method goodwill) for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.

 Overview 
 We are a national provider of diagnostic imaging services in the United States. At September 30, 2024, we operated directly or indirectly through joint ventures with hospitals, 399 centers located in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Our centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, often reducing the cost and amount of care for patients. Internationally, our subsidiary The HLH Imaging Group Limited fka Heart and Lung Imaging Limited, provides teleradiology services for remote interpretation of images on behalf of providers within the framework of the United Kingdom's National Health Service. 
 In addition to our imaging business, we have established a Digital Health business segment for our 2024 fiscal year, which combines our former Artificial Intelligence AI business segment with our eRad, Inc. business. Our digital health segment develops and delivers AI-powered health informatics solutions to drive quality, efficiency, and outcomes in imaging and radiology. The portfolio of software solutions are anchored by eRad, Inc.'s RIS/PACS, informatics designed specifically for outpatient radiology and DeepHealth OS, a cloud-native operating system that helps operate all aspects of the radiology service line from scheduling and patient preparation to technologist workflow to interpretation and referral management. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 In addition we are using AI to develop solutions that employ machine learning to assist radiologists and other clinicians in interpreting images and improving radiologist efficiency and patient care, initially in the fields of screening for breast, prostate, lung and colon cancers. Our DeepHealth, Inc. subsidiary has received FDA clearance for use of its SaigeQ triage /workflow product, SaigeDX advanced diagnostic product and Saige-Density breast density assessment software for screening breast mammography, which we have begun to roll out in certain markets as an Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection solution. Our Aidence Holding B.V. subsidiary is developing solutions for interpretation of chest and lung CT scans for lung cancer screening. It has received the CE mark for its solution and has existing customers in seven European countries, with its largest concentration in the United Kingdom, and plans to submit an application for FDA clearance to sell in the United States. Our Quantib B.V. subsidiary is primarily focused on interpretation of prostate MRI for widespread prostate cancer screening. Quantib s prostate MRI post-processing software has both FDA clearances and European CE marking. Our digital health segment provides these solutions to RadNet and to over 400 customers in the United States, Europe, and Israel. 
 Our operations comprise two segments for financial reporting purposes for this reporting period, Imaging Centers and Digital Health. For further financial information about these segments, see Note 5, Segment Reporting, in the notes accompanying our financial statements included in this report. Prior period amounts in the financial statements included in this report have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the change in reportable segment. 
 Recent Developments 
 The following table shows our imaging centers in operation and revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Our imaging services include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, diagnostic radiology (X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures. The vast majority of our centers offer multi-modality imaging services, a key point of differentiation from our competitors. The multi-modality offering provides a one-stop solution for our customers and referral sources. It also diversifies our revenue base, and reduces our exposure to changes in reimbursement rates for certain imaging modalities. The following charts summarize our procedure volumes for various imaging modalities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Table of Contents 

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of payors, including private, managed care capitated and government payors. We believe our payor diversity mitigates our exposure to possible unfavorable reimbursement trends within any one payor class. Our total service fee revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, and implicit price concessions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 received from our various payors is summarized in the following table (in thousands):

 Acquisitions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of entities which engage directly in the practice of radiology or in associated businesses for an aggregate consideration of 54.0 million. These acquisitions include: 
 Antelope Valley Outpatient Imaging: 1 imaging center in California; 
 Providence Health System Southern California: 3 imaging centers in California;

 Joint Venture Activity 
 At September 30, 2024, 38 of our imaging centers were operating as joint ventures with large health care providers. We have joint venture arrangements with 24 hospital and health system partners (inclusive of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures), including MemorialCare (24 centers), RWJ Barnabas (35 centers), Cedars Sinai (18 centers), Dignity Health (28 centers), and MedStar Health System (5 centers). We manage the day to day operations for these joint ventures and perform most management services in exchange for a management fee. We charged management service fees from the centers underlying these joint ventures of approximately 5.9 million and 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For information on our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, key balance sheet data and income 
 statement data for the unconsolidated joint ventures, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies Investment in Joint Ventures 
 to the financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that (a) are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and (b) require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. In Note 2 to our financial statements included in this report and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we discuss our significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. The most significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates are described below. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The financial statements included in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions affect various matters, including our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements; our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements; and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods. These estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control. As a result, actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates. 
 Revenues 
 
 Our revenues generally relate to net patient fees received from various payors and patients themselves under contracts in which our performance obligations are to provide diagnostic services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide diagnostic services are satisfied, which is generally over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payor (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payors. The payment arrangements with third-party payors for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges and generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnostic services or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations, changes in business and economic conditions, and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract re-negotiations and renewals. 
 
 As it relates to the Consolidated Medical Group, this service fee revenue includes payments for both the professional medical interpretation revenue recognized by them as well as the payment for all other aspects related to our providing the imaging services, for which we earn management fees. As it relates to others centers, this service fee revenue is earned through providing the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services as well as providing administration services such as clerical and administrative personnel, bookkeeping and accounting services, billing and collection, provision of medical and office supplies, secretarial, reception and transcription services, maintenance of medical records, and advertising, marketing and promotional activities. 
 Our revenues are based upon our management's estimate of amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payors. Estimates of contractual allowances under Medicare, Medicaid, managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon historical collection experience of the payments received from such payors in accordance with the underlying contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts

 for patients who have health care coverage may have price concessions applied. We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect. 
 Under capitation arrangements with various health plans, we earn a per-enrollee amount each month for making available diagnostic imaging services to all plan enrollees under the capitation arrangement. Revenue under capitation arrangements is recognized in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans. Our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition did not change materially for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Accounts Receivable 
 Substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee-for-service contracts from third party payors, such as insurance companies and government-sponsored healthcare programs, or directly from patients. Services are generally provided pursuant to one-year contracts with healthcare providers. Receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third-party payors. We continuously monitor collections from our payors and maintain an allowance for bad debts based upon specific payor collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience. Our estimates and assumptions for allowances on our account receivable did not change materially during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Business Combination 
 We evaluate all acquisitions under the framework Clarifying the Definition of a Business in the accounting guidance. Once a purchase has been determined to be the acquisition of a business, we are required to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Any portion of the purchase consideration transferred in excess of the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, is allocated to goodwill. The allocation requires our management to make estimates of the value of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangibles 
 Goodwill at September 30, 2024 totaled 711.8 million. Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets at September 30, 2024 were 20.2 million and are associated with the value of certain trade name intangibles and in process research and development ("IPR D"). Goodwill, trade name intangibles and IPR D are recorded as a result of business combinations. When we determine the carrying value of goodwill for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized which should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. Our annual impairment test of goodwill and trade name noted no impairment as of October 1, 2023, and we have not identified any other indicators of impairment through September 30, 2024.

 Imaging Center Segment 
 We have developed our medical imaging centers segment through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and joint venture formations. In the discussion below same center metrics are based on imaging centers that were in operation throughout the period of July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. Excluded amounts relate to imaging centers that were acquired or divested between July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

 Our 10.8 increase in same center revenue over the same period last year was driven by increases in fees charged per imaging procedure and an increase in procedures volumes. Same center total procedure volume grew at an overall rate of 4.0 which was comprised of a 2.55 increase in routine imaging and an 8.6 increase in advanced modality imaging procedures. The increase in revenue was largely attributable to product mix, as advanced imaging was a greater portion of overall procedures. A significant contributor to the change in product mix was the increase in PETHC procedures related to prostate cancer and suspect Alzheimer s studies, which are included in advanced modality imaging procedures. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 57.6 million, or 16.5 , to 407.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 349.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Consistent with the higher procedure volumes noted above, our staffing levels were adjusted to support the influx of patients seeking radiology procedures. We are continuing to face inflation in employee wage rates as we compete for talent in a tight labor market. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 
 Stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 0.3 million, or 6.6 , to 4.2 million from 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher fair value of stock awards granted in the first quarter of 2024.

 The increase in medical supplies expense was driven by our higher patient volume and product shift towards more advanced imaging modalities. The increase in PETHC procedures related to prostate cancer and suspected Alzheimer studies also raised medical supplies expense due to the requirement for high-cost isotope tracers.

 The increase in depreciation expense was the result of our higher depreciable asset base. 
 The fair value of the 2019 Swaps at September 30, 2024 was a net asset of 7.7 million compared to a net asset of 14.4 million June 30, 2024, resulting in a loss of 6.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This change in fair value was driven by market expectations of continued declines in interest rates over the remaining term of the 2019 Swaps. 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included money market interest income of 9.6 million, partially offset by a impairment of non-marketable securities of 1.2 million. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 6.0 million, or 164.9 , to 9.6 million from 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher average cash balance in our money market account for the three months ended September 30, 2023

 The increase in interest expense was the result in of refinancing of our Barclays credit facility, which added approximately 196.3 million in additional term loan debt to the facility. The effect of the additional term loan was partially offset by lower interest rates compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest rates were above the arranged rates in our 2019 Swaps for most of the year and we received payment of 3.4 million in cash payments from our 2019 swap counterparties, which was reported as a component of interest expense. Also, the 2019 Swaps for 100 million of notional value matured in October 2023, so they were in effect for the third quarter of 2023, but not 2024. See the Derivative Instruments section of Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes accompanying in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and Part 1, Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk" below for more details on our derivative transactions. 
 
 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we recognized equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures in the amount of 3.6 million and 1.1 million, respectively, an increase of 2.5 million or 231.6 . The increase was mainly due to the additional contribution made to Santa Monica Imaging Group, LLC in September 2023. Santa Monica Imaging Group operated at a net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which positively impacted our equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures during the period. Additionally, we experienced improved earnings from our interest in the Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group joint venture, which was established in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 At September 30, 2024, our consolidated subsidiaries operated 345 imaging centers of which 98 were not wholly-owned and thus a portion of their operating results were attributable to noncontrolling interests. At September 30, 2023, our consolidated subsidiaries included 320 centers of which 83 were not wholly-owned. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 9.0 million versus 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.6 million. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to the formation of a new majority owned subsidiary, Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC in September 2023 and Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC in March 2024. We contributed the operations of three centers to Los Angeles Group, LLC and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center contributed cash. Additionally, patient volumes for advanced modalities improved in 2024 and we closed two underperforming centers in a majority owned subsidiary, Beach Imaging Group, LLC in December 2023. 
 As noncontrolling interests only represent a portion of our imaging center business, and excludes our Digital Health Segment which generated losses of 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we do not expect changes in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to correlate with changes in consolidated operating income or pretax income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 In the discussion below, same center metrics are based on imaging centers that were in operation throughout the period of January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. Excluded amounts relate to imaging centers that were acquired or divested between January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

 Our 10.6 increase in same center revenue over the same period last year was driven by increases in fees charged per imaging procedure and same center total procedure volume growth of 3.3 inclusive of rises in routine and advanced modality imaging procedures of 1.82 and 7.76 , respectively. The increase in revenue was largely attributable to product mix product mix, as advanced imaging was a greater portion of overall procedures. A significant contributor to the change in product mix was the increase in PETHC procedures related to prostate cancer and suspected Alzheimer studies, which are included in advanced modality imaging procedures.

 The increase in depreciation expense was the result of our higher depreciable asset base. 
 The fair value of the 2019 Swaps at September 30, 2024 was a net asset of 7.7 million compared to a net asset of 15.1 million December 31, 2023, resulting in a loss of 7.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This change in fair value was driven by market expectations of continued declines in interest rates over the remaining term of the 2019 Swaps. 
 Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included money market interest income of 22.7 million, partially offset by an impairment of non-marketable securities of 1.2 million and a debt extinguishment and restructuring charges of 8.9 million, which related to refinancing of our Barclays credit facility. See Note 6 Credit Facilities and Notes Payable included in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 16.4 million, or 260.2 , to 22.7 million from 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to higher average cash balance in our money market account for the nine months ended September 30, 2024

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest rates were above the arranged rates in our 2019 Swaps for most of the year and we received payment of 10.2 million in cash payments from our 2019 swap counterparties, which was reported as a component of interest expense. Also, the 2019 Swaps for 100 million of notional value matured in October 2023, so they were in effect for the third quarter of 2023, but not 2024.

 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures in the amount of 11.3 million compared to 3.9 million for the prior period, an increase of 7.4 million or 187.4 . The increase was mainly due to the additional contribution made to SMIG in September 2023. SMIG operated at a net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which positively impacted our equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures during

 the period. Additionally, the increase was supported by improved earnings from our interest in the Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group joint venture, which was established in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 Income tax expense 
 We recorded income tax expense of 4.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 16.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 24.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 diverge from the federal statutory rate due to (i) effects of state income taxes ; (ii) officer's compensation limitations; (iii) partial valuation allowance on losses in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by (iv) excess tax benefits attributable to share based compensation; and (v) noncontrolling interests from controlled partnerships. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 At September 30, 2024, our consolidated subsidiaries operated 345 imaging centers of which 98 were not wholly-owned and thus a portion of their operating results were attributable to noncontrolling interests. At September 30, 2023, our consolidated subsidiaries included 320 centers of which 83 were not wholly-owned. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 27.2 million versus 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.8 million. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to the formation of a new majority owned subsidiary, Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC in September 2023 and Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC in March 2024. We contributed the operations of three centers to Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center contributed cash. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was also impacted by an increase in patient volumes for advanced modalities in 2024 and the closure of two underperforming centers in a majority owned subsidiary, Beach Imaging Group, LLC in December 2023. 
 As noncontrolling interests only represent a portion of our imaging center business, and excludes our Digital Health Segment which generated losses of 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we do not expect changes in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to correlate with changes in consolidated operating income or pretax income.

 Revenues for the Digital Health segment increased as a result of core growth in our eRad PICS business, the rollout in 2023 of our Deephealth OS, and continued rollout of our Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection solutions across additional facilities. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to salary expense as we increased headcount in connection with the commercialization of our initial AI products and higher non-capitalized research and development expenses with respect to our new DeepHealth cloud OS and generative AI. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a non-recurring gain of 7.2 million from change in fair value of contingent consideration, offsetting against other operating expense. Aside from the effect of that one-time gain and increased non-capitalized research and development expenses, our net loss for the segment was consistent with the prior year. We expect that our Digital Health segment will continue to generate net losses over the next several years. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics to measure our financial results. We believe that, in addition to GAAP metrics, non-GAAP metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA assist us in measuring our core operations from period to period. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA metric removes non-cash and non-recurring charges that occur in the affected period and provides a basis for measuring the Company s core financial performance against other periods. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude losses or gains on the disposal of equipment, other income or loss, loss on debt extinguishment, bargain purchase gains, loss on de-consolidation of joint ventures, gain on contribution of imaging centers into joint ventures, and non-cash equity compensation. Adjusted EBITDA includes equity earnings in unconsolidated operations and subtracts allocations of earnings to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, and is adjusted for non-cash or one-time events that take place during the period.

 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used as an analytical indicator by us and the healthcare industry to assess business performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore susceptible to varying methods of calculation and this metric, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 The following is a reconciliation of the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We expect our existing capital resources, anticipated cash from operations and our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will be sufficient to sustain our operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our principal capital requirements are for the development of new diagnostic imaging centers, the acquisition of existing diagnostic imaging centers and the acquisition of new diagnostic imaging equipment. On a continuing basis, we evaluate various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We expect to fund any future acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including borrowing available under our secured credit facilities or through new equity or debt issuances. 
 
 We and our subsidiaries or affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt or equity securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. 
 
 The following table summarizes key balance sheet data related to our liquidity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and income statement data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The following table summarizes key components of our sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Cash Flow Data September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 190,494 131,943 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (184,257) (152,823) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 400,069 231,101 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 58.6 million compared to September 30, 2023 primarily driven by a 35.7 million change in assets and liabilities, primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from September 30, 2023 by 31.4 million. Purchases of imaging centers during the period was 37.7 million, a 26.8 million increase from the prior period. Capital expenditures for property and equipment during the period was 145.2 million, a 8.6 million increase from the prior period. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a secondary public offering of our common stock and a refinancing of our Barclays credit facility. In March 2024, we completed a public offering of 5,232,500 shares of our common stock, which included 682,500 shares sold pursuant to an underwriters overallotment option, at a price to the public of 44.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds after underwriting discounts, commissions, and expenses of 218.3 million. In April 2024, we refinanced our Barclays credit facility replacing the prior facility with an 875 million term loan. After paying off the balance on the prior facility, payment of accrued interest through the closing of the refinance transaction, and payment of transaction fees and expenses, we added approximately 167.9 million in cash to the balance sheet. 
 Secured Credit Facilities 
 We maintain secured credit facilities with Barclays Bank PLC and with Truist Bank. 
 On April 18, 2024, we refinanced our Barclays credit facility, replacing the prior facility with an 875.0 million term loan and a 282.0 million revolving credit facility. The refinance transaction reduced our interest rates on the Barclays term loan and revolving credit facility and extended the maturity date for the term loan to April 18, 2031 and for the revolving credit facility to April 18, 2029. The new term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of 2.2 million, compared to 1.8 million under the prior credit facility. 
 Our condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 include 1,009.7 million of total term loan debt (exclusive of unamortized discounts of 15.8 million) in thousands: 
 Face Value Discount Total Carrying Value Barclays Term Loan 872,812 (15,234) 857,578 Truist Term Loan 136,875 (792) 136,083 Total Term Loans 1,009,687 (16,026) 993,661 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings under our Barclays or Truist revolving credit facilities. After reserves for outstanding letters of credit of 8.3 million, we had 273.7 million available for borrowing under our Barclays Revolving Credit Facility and 50.0 million available under our Truist Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Please see Note 6, Credit Facilities and Notes Payable in the notes to financial statements included in this report for more information on our secured credit facilities. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk: 
 We are exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues and expenses denominated in the Pound Sterling, Euro, Canadian Dollar and Hungarian Forint. We provide radiological services in the United Kingdom, conduct Artificial Intelligence operations in the Netherlands, and maintain research and development centers in Canada, Hungary and India. We 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 do not have any foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate this risk. At September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1 decline in the currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar against these currencies, would have resulted in an annual increase of approximately 0.3 million in operating expenses. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity : 
 Our debt instruments, including borrowings under our Barclays credit facility and our Truist credit facility, bear interest at variable rates. Accordingly, our interest expense and our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates. 
 To mitigate our future floating rate interest expense exposure we entered into the 2019 Swaps with locked in interest rates for one-month Term SOFR of 1.89 for 100 million of notional value and 1.98 for 400 million of notional value. We are liable for premium payments to the 2019 swap counterparties if interests rates are below the arranged rates, and receive payments from the 2019 swap counterparties if interest rates exceed the arranged rates. If interest rates were to theoretically reduce to 0 , our maximum premium payment would be the difference between the two swapped rates and 0 then multiplied by the notional value of the swaps, or 1.89 million per year for the 100 million swap and 8.0 million per year for the 400 million swap. Payments under the 2019 Swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis. The 2019 Swaps for the 100 million of notional value matured in October 2023, so they were in effect for the third quarter of 2023, but not 2024. The 2019 Swaps for the 400 million notional amount will expire in October 2025. 
 We can elect SOFR or Alternative Base Rate interest options on amounts outstanding under the Barclays Term Loan. At September 30, 2024, we had 872.8 million outstanding subject to an SOFR election on the Barclays Term Loan. At September 30, 2024, our effective SOFR interest rate plus applicable margin was 7.78 . The 2019 Swaps secure a 1.98 SOFR rate for a 400 million notional amount. After giving effect to our 2019 Swaps, we had 472.8 million outstanding under the Barclays Term Loan that is unprotected by the 2019 Swaps at September 30, 2024. Consequently, a hypothetical 1 increase in the SOFR rates under the Barclay's credit facility would result in an increase of 4.7 million in annual interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes. The 2019 Swaps will mature in October 2025. 
 
 We can elect SOFR or Base Rate interest rate options on amounts outstanding under the Truist credit facility. At September 30, 2024, we had 136.9 million outstanding subject to an adjusted SOFR election on the Truist Term Loan. At September 30, 2024, our effective SOFR rate plus applicable margin was 6.20 . A hypothetical 1 increase in the adjusted Eurodollar rates under the Truist credit facility would result in an increase of approximately 1.4 million in annual interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes. 
 
 ITEM 4 . Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
