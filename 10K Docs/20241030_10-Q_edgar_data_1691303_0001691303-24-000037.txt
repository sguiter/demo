The CODM reviews financial information at the operating segment level to allocate resources and to assess the operating results and financial performance for each operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated into a reportable segment if the operating segments have similar quantitative economic characteristics and if the operating segments are similar in the following qualitative characteristics: (i) nature of products and services; (ii) nature of production processes; (iii) type or class of customer for their products and services; (iv) methods used to distribute the products or provide services; and (v) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. 
 The Company has determined that the operating segments are similar in both quantitative and qualitative characteristics and thus, the operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segment. The Company has determined that its natural gas and royalty businesses and the Blue Creek mine development did not meet the criteria in ASC 280 to be considered as operating or reportable segments. Therefore, the Company has included their results in an all other category as a reconciling item to consolidated amounts. 
 The Company does not allocate all of its assets, or its depreciation and depletion expense, selling, general and administrative expenses, transactions costs, interest income (expense), and income tax expense by segment.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Annual Report"). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Please see Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a U.S.-based, environmentally and socially minded supplier to the global steel industry. We are dedicated entirely to mining non-thermal metallurgical ("met") steelmaking coal used as a critical component of steel production by metal manufacturers in Europe, South America and Asia. We are a large-scale, low-cost producer and exporter of premium quality met coal, also known as hard coking coal HCC ), operating highly-efficient longwall operations in our underground mines based in Alabama, Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7. 
 As of December 31, 2023, based on a reserve report prepared by Marshall Miller Associates, Inc. ("Marshall Miller"), Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, our two operating mines, had approximately 82.9 million metric tons of recoverable reserves and our undeveloped Blue Creek mine contained 67.6 million metric tons of recoverable reserves and 39.7 million metric tons of coal resources exclusive of reserves, which total 107.3 million metric tons. As a result of our high-quality coal, our Mine No. 7 steelmaking coal realized price has historically been in line with, or at a slight discount to, the Platts Premium Low Volatility ("LV") Free On Board ("FOB") Australia Index Price ("Platts Index"). Our Mine No. 4 steelmaking coal transitioned in the second half of 2023 from a Mid Volatility ("MV") to a High Volatility A ("HVA") quality that typically trades at a larger discount to the price of coal from Mine No. 7. We now primarily target the East Coast High Vol A indices price for our Mine No. 4 coal. Our steelmaking coal, mined from the Southern Appalachian portion of the Blue Creek coal seam, is characterized by low sulfur, low-to-medium ash, and Low Vol to High Vol. These qualities make our coal ideally suited as a coking coal for the manufacture of steel. 
 We sell substantially all of our steelmaking coal production to steel producers outside of the United States. Steelmaking coal, which is converted to coke, is a critical input in the steel production process. Steelmaking coal is both consumed domestically in the countries where it is produced and exported by several of the largest producing countries, such as China, Australia, the United States, Canada and Russia. Therefore, demand for our coal will be highly correlated to conditions in the global steelmaking industry. The steelmaking industry s demand for steelmaking coal is affected by a number of factors, including the cyclical nature of that industry s business, technological developments in the steelmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant reduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the demand for steelmaking coal, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Similarly, if alternative ingredients are used in substitution for steelmaking coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for steelmaking coal would materially decrease, which could also materially adversely affect demand for our steelmaking coal. 
 Recent Developments 
 U.S. inflation is currently at approximately 2.4 , driven by increased energy and food costs, supply constraints and strong consumer demand. While inflation in the overall economy has eased in the last twelve months, we have not seen it easing significantly in the coal mining industry. We expect that inflation will continue to negatively impact our profitability, as we expect inflation to remain high for steel prices, freight rates, labor and other materials and supplies. Specifically, we have experienced inflationary cost increases ranging from 25 to 35 , primarily in relation to labor, construction materials, and certain equipment. In addition, we have experienced inflation in the costs of belt structure, roof bolts, cable, magnetite, rock dust and other supplies, plus labor and parts on equipment repair and rebuilds. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, high-quality steelmaking coal prices reached a three-year low driven by a confluence of weaker demand, excess Chinese steel exports in our customers' markets, and ample availability of steelmaking coals. As of October 11, 2024, the Platts Index price for premium LV coal was 207.00 per metric ton. Per the Wood Mackenzie global metallurgical coal short-term outlook released in September 2024, premium LV coal is expected to remain rangebound between 170.00 and 200.00 per metric ton for the remainder of the year. This expectation is in large part driven by additional Chinese stimulus measures and the end of India's monsoon season, combined with the fact that the premium LV coal price now cuts into the cost curve and approximately 13 of hard coking coal supply is making a negative margin at 180 per metric ton. 
 18 

While we expect steelmaking coal prices to improve slightly in the fourth quarter, we believe the pricing environment will remain under pressure due to the persistent weakness in the global steel markets and delayed infrastructure spending in India. 
 Collective Bargaining Agreement 
 Our Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") with the labor union representing certain of our hourly employees expired on April 1, 2021 and the labor union initiated a strike after an agreement on a new contract was not reached. As a result of the strike, we initially idled Mine No. 4 and scaled back operations at Mine No. 7. In the first quarter of 2022, we restarted operations at Mine No. 4. On February 16, 2023, the labor union representing certain of our hourly employees announced that they were ending the strike and made an unconditional offer to return to work. We incurred business interruption expenses of approximately 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represent ongoing legal expenses associated with ongoing labor negotiations. We incurred 0.3 million and 8.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represent non-recurring expenses that were directly attributable to the labor strike for incremental safety and security, labor negotiations and other expenses. These expenses are presented separately in the Condensed Statements of Operations. The Company continues to engage in good faith efforts with the labor union to reach an agreement on a new contract. 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 Our primary business, the mining and exporting of steelmaking coal for the steel industry, is conducted in one reportable business segment: mining. All other operations and results are reported under the All Other category as a reconciling item to consolidated amounts, which includes the business results from our sale of natural gas extracted as a byproduct from our underground coal mines, royalties from our leased properties and the business results related to the Blue Creek mine development. Our natural gas and royalty businesses do not meet the criteria in ASC 280, Segment Reporting , to be considered as operating or reportable segments. 
 Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) Segment Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP financial measure; (ii) sales volumes and average net selling price, which drive coal sales revenue; (iii) cash cost of sales, a non-GAAP financial measure; and (iv) Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. The following table presents supplementary data on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated. 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 88,346 156,512 429,877 564,954 Metric tons sold 1,688 2,048 5,523 5,429 Metric tons produced 1,739 1,808 5,570 5,149 Average net selling price per metric ton 189.54 203.56 218.79 237.32 Cash cost of sales per metric ton 136.10 126.36 140.07 132.49 Cost of production 66 62 63 60 Transportation and royalties 34 38 37 40 Adjusted EBITDA 78,492 145,780 394,634 535,167 
 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for other revenues; cost of other revenues; depreciation and depletion expense; selling, general and administrative expenses; business interruption expenses; interest income, net; income tax expense; loss on early extinguishment of debt; other expense and certain transactions or adjustments that the Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Decision Maker, does not consider for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or assessing segment performance. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess: 
 19 

our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; 
 the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends; 
 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
 
 Sales Volumes and Average Net Selling Price 
 We evaluate our operations based on the volume of coal we can safely produce and sell in compliance with regulatory standards, and the prices we receive for our steelmaking coal. Our sales volume and sales prices are largely dependent upon the terms of our annual steelmaking coal sales contracts, for which prices generally are set on daily index averages on a quarterly basis. The volume of steelmaking coal we sell is also a function of the pricing environment in the international met coal markets and the amounts of LV and HVA coal that we sell. We evaluate the price we receive for our steelmaking coal based on our average net selling price per metric ton. 
 Our average net selling price per metric ton represents our coal net sales revenue divided by total metric tons of coal sold. In addition, our average net selling price per metric ton is net of demurrage and quality specification adjustments. We normally compete on a delivered basis when negotiating contract and spot transactions with our global customers. However, depending on market dynamics and other circumstances, the burden of ocean freight may be borne entirely by the supplier, shared between both partners, or assumed entirely by the customer. In the instance when we are responsible for the freight, the freight costs will reduce our net sales revenues and impact our net selling price realizations. 
 
 Cash Cost of Sales 
 We evaluate our cash cost of sales on a cost per metric ton basis. Cash cost of sales is based on reported cost of sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items, and may be adjusted for other items that, pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), are classified in the Condensed Statements of Operations as costs other than cost of sales, but relate directly to the costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it FOB at the Port of Mobile in Alabama. Our cash cost of sales per metric ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by the metric tons sold. Cash cost of sales is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess: 
 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and 
 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
 We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional insight into our operating performance, and reflects how management analyzes our operating performance and compares that performance against other companies for purposes of business decision making by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe that cash cost of sales presents a useful measure of our controllable costs and our operational results by including all costs incurred to produce met coal and sell it FOB at the Port of Mobile in Alabama. Period-to-period comparisons of cash cost of sales are intended to help management identify and assess additional trends that potentially impact us and that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of cost of sales. Cash cost of sales should not be considered an alternative to cost of sales or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Cash cost of sales excludes some, but not all, items that affect cost of sales, and our presentation may vary from the presentations of other companies. As a result, cash cost of sales as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of cash cost of sales to total cost of sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest income, net, income tax expense, depreciation and depletion, non-cash asset retirement obligation accretion, non-cash stock compensation expense, other non-cash accretion, mark-to-market gain on gas hedges, business interruption, loss on early extinguishment of debt and other income. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess: 
 our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; and 
 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in this report provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that presented by other companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.

Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table summarizes certain unaudited financial information for these periods. 
 For the three months ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 of Total Revenues 2023 of Total Revenues Revenues: Sales 319,944 97.6 416,888 98.4 Other revenues 7,776 2.4 6,599 1.6 Total revenues 327,720 100.0 423,487 100.0 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) 231,598 70.7 260,376 61.5 Cost of other revenues (exclusive of items shown separately below) 8,854 2.7 9,855 2.3 Depreciation and depletion 36,642 11.2 34,020 8.0 Selling, general and administrative 11,403 3.5 11,138 2.6 Business interruption 107 347 0.1 Total costs and expenses 288,604 88.1 315,736 74.6 Operating income 39,116 11.9 107,751 25.4 Interest expense (1,422) (0.4) (3,418) (0.8) Interest income 8,679 2.6 10,691 2.5 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (11,699) (2.8) Other expense (1,102) (0.3) Income before income tax expense 46,373 14.2 102,223 24.1 Income tax expense 4,607 1.4 16,841 4.0 Net income 41,766 12.7 85,382 20.2 
 Sales and cost of sales components on a per unit basis were as follows: 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Met Coal (metric tons in thousands) Metric tons sold 1,688 2,048 Metric tons produced 1,739 1,808 Average net selling price per metric ton 189.54 203.56 Cash cost of sales per metric ton 136.10 126.36 
 We produced 1.7 million metric tons of steelmaking coal for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million metric tons for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 3.8 decrease. The decreased production is primarily due to us operating at lower capacity levels in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 due to anticipated lower sales volumes discussed in further detail below. 
 Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 319.9 million compared to 416.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 96.9 million decrease in sales was primarily driven by a 73.3 million decrease in sales due to a 17.6 or 0.4 million metric ton decrease in steelmaking coal sales volume and a 23.7 million decrease in sales related to a 14.02 per metric ton decrease in the average net selling price per metric ton of steelmaking coal. The 17.6 decrease in sales volumes was driven by us being selective with spot sales and exercising patience while we wait for market conditions to improve. The average net selling price of our steelmaking coal decreased 14.02 from 203.56 per metric ton in the third quarter of 2023 to 189.54 per metric ton in the third quarter of 2024. 
 22 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our geographic customer mix was 44 in Europe, 41 in Asia, 15 in South America and 1 in the United States. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our geographic customer mix was 45 in Asia, 36 in Europe and 19 in South America. Our geographic customer mix typically varies each period based on the timing of customer orders and shipments. 
 Other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.8 million compared to 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenues are comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, gains on sales and disposals of property, plant and equipment and land and earned royalty revenue. The 1.2 million increase in other revenues is primarily due to an increase of royalty income offset partially by a decrease in the Southern Louisiana natural gas price average per Million British Thermal Unit ("MMBtu") of 15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable period. 
 Cost of sales was 231.6 million, or 70.7 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 260.4 million, or 61.5 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 28.8 million decrease is primarily driven by a 45.5 million decrease due to a 0.4 million metric ton decrease in steelmaking coal sales volume offset partially by a 16.4 million increase due to a 9.74 per metric ton increase in cash cost of sales per metric ton due to an increase in production costs driven by increased headcount and supply costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of production represented 66 of cost of sales and transportation and royalties accounted for approximately 34 compared to cost of production of 62 and transportation and royalties of 38 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and depletion expenses were 36.6 million, or 11.2 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.0 million, or 8.0 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.6 million increase in depreciation and depletion is primarily driven by an increase in additional assets placed into service partially offset by a decrease in met coal sales volume as depreciation and depletion is first capitalized into coal inventory and relieved when the tons are sold. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 11.4 million, or 3.5 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.1 million, or 2.6 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period is due to an increase in employee related expenses. 
 Business interruption expenses were 0.1 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses represent ongoing legal expenses associated with labor negotiations. 
 Interest expense was 1.4 million, or 0.4 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 3.4 million, or 0.8 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.0 million decrease is due to the early retirement of 146.1 million of our 350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875 senior secured notes due 2028 (the "Notes") in September 2023, maturity of financing leases and the capitalization of interest associated with the development of Blue Creek. 
 Interest income was 8.7 million, or 2.6 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.7 million, or 2.5 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.0 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in invested cash balances and lower rates of return earned on our investments. 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 11.7 million represents a premium paid to early retire 146.1 million of our Notes, accelerated amortization of debt discount and fees incurred in connection with the transaction. 
 Other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 1.1 million, or 0.3 of total revenues, primarily represents non-recurring expenses incurred in connection with a ransomware attack. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax ex pense of 4.6 million comp ared to income tax expense of 16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 12.2 million decrease in income tax expense is primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income. We estimated our annual effective tax rate and applied this effective tax rate to our year-to-date pretax income at the end of the interim reporting period. The 4.6 million income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, includes a benefit related to depletion, Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 250 Deduction: Foreign-Derived Intangible Income ("FDII") and Section 45l Deduction: Marginal Well Credit. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and enacted IRC Section 250 Deduction: FDII, which provides for, among other things, a deduction of 37.5 with respect to foreign-derived intangible income, which reduces the statutory tax rate from 21 to 13.125 . Beginning in 2026, the deduction is reduced from 37.5 to 21.875 of foreign- 
 23 

derived intangible income. The Marginal Well Credit is a production-based tax credit that provides a credit for qualified natural gas production and is phased out when natural gas prices exceed certain thresholds.

 Sales and cost of sales components on a per unit basis were as follows: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Met Coal (metric tons in thousands) Metric tons sold 5,523 5,429 Metric tons produced 5,570 5,149 Average net selling price per metric ton 218.79 237.32 Cash cost of sales per metric ton 140.07 132.49 
 We produced 5.6 million metric tons of steelmaking coal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.1 million metric tons for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an 8 increase. The increased production drove a slight increase in sales as both Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 operated at higher capacity levels in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,208.4 million compared to 1,288.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 80.0 million or 6.2 decrease in sales was primarily driven by a 102.3 million decrease in sales related to a 7.8 or 18.53 per metric ton decrease in the average net selling price per metric ton of steelmaking coal offset partially by a 22.3 million increase in sales due to a 1.7 or 0.1 million metric ton increase in steelmaking coal sales volume. The 1.7 increase in sales volumes was driven by increased production due to both Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 operating at higher capacity levels combined with improved performance by our rail transportation provider and the McDuffie Terminal.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our geographic customer mix was 43 in Asia, 39 in Europe, 17 in South America and 1 in the United States. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our geographic customer mix was 46 in Europe, 34 in Asia, and 20 in South America. Our geographic customer mix typically varies each period based on the timing of customer orders and shipments. 
 Other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.4 million compared to 24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenues are comprised of revenue derived from our natural gas operations, gains on sales and disposals of property, plant and equipment and land, changes in the fair value of our natural gas swap contracts, as well as earned royalty revenue. The 5.0 million decrease in other revenues is due to the decrease in the Southern Louisiana natural gas price average of 0.52 per MMBtu or 19 and a decrease in sales volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable period. 
 Cost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) was 778.5 million, or 63.4 , of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 723.5 million, or 55.1 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 55.0 million increase is primarily driven by a 41.9 million increase due to an increase in cost of production primarily driven by increased labor costs, increased supply costs and increased transportation costs due to multiple failures of lock and dam systems that have prevented us from barging coal for the majority of this year combined with a 12.4 million increase due to a 2 or 0.1 million metric ton increase in steelmaking coal sales volume. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of production represented 63 of cost of sales and transportation and royalties accounted for approximately 37 compared to cost of production of 60 and transportation and royalties of 40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and depletion expenses were 114.8 million, or 9.4 of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 101.8 million, or 7.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 13.0 million increase in depreciation and depletion is primarily driven by additional assets placed into service and a 1.7 or 0.1 million metric ton increase in steelmaking coal sales volume as depreciation and depletion is first capitalized into coal inventory and relieved when the tons are sold. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 45.5 million, or 3.7 of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 38.8 million, or 3.0 of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 6.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the period is due to an increase in employee related expenses. 
 Business interruption expenses were 0.4 million and 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses decreased compared to the prior period primarily due to the end of the labor strike on February 16, 2023 that the labor union initiated on April 1, 2021. The expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent ongoing legal expenses associated with the labor negotiations and the expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represent non-recurring expenses that were directly attributable to the labor strike for incremental safety and security, legal and labor negotiations and other expenses. 
 Interest expense was 3.5 million, or 0.3 of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.3 million, or 1.2 of total revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 12.9 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense due to the early retirement of our Notes in September 2023, an increase in capitalized interest associated with the Blue Creek project and maturity of financing leases. 
 Interest income was 26.1 million, or 2.1 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.2 million, or 2.4 , of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 5.2 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in invested cash balances and lower rates of return earned on our investments. 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 11.7 million represents a premium paid to early retire 146.1 million of our Notes, accelerated amortization of debt discount and fees incurred in connection with the transaction. 
 Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.9 million represents non-recurring expenses incurred in connection with a ransomware attack offset partially by proceeds received from the Chapter 11 Cases from Walter Energy, Inc. 
 We recognized income tax expense of 32.2 million and 60.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income. We estimated our annual effective tax rate and applied this effective tax rate to our year-to-date pretax income at the end of the 
 25 

interim reporting period. The 32.2 million income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a benefit related to depletion, IRC Section 250 Deduction: FDII and Section 45l Deduction: Marginal Well Credit. The TCJA was enacted on December 22, 2017 and enacted IRC Section 250 Deduction: FDII, which provides for, among other things, a deduction of 37.5 with respect to foreign-derived intangible income, which reduces the statutory tax rate from 21 to 13.125 . Beginning in 2026, the deduction is reduced from 37.5 to 21.875 of foreign-derived intangible income. The Marginal Well Credit is a production-based tax credit that provides a credit for qualified natural gas production and is phased out when natural gas prices exceed certain thresholds. We estimated our annual effective tax rate and applied this effective tax rate to our year-to-date pretax income at the end of the interim reporting period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 Our sources of cash have been steelmaking coal and natural gas sales to customers, proceeds received from the Notes and access to our ABL Facility. Historically, our primary uses of cash have been for funding the operations of our coal and natural gas production operations, working capital, our capital expenditures, our reclamation obligations, payment of principal and interest on our Notes, professional fees and other non-recurring transaction expenses. In addition, we used available cash on hand to repurchase shares of common stock and to pay our quarterly and special dividends, each of which reduces or reduced cash and cash equivalents. 
 Going forward, we plan to use cash to fund debt service payments on our Notes, the ABL Facility and our other indebtedness, to fund operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, reclamation obligations, professional fees and other non-recurring transaction expenses and strategic investments, the development of Blue Creek, and, if declared, to pay our quarterly and/or special dividends. Our ability to fund our capital needs, including the development of Blue Creek, going forward will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, and, in the case of any future strategic investments, capital needs, the development of Blue Creek, or special dividends financed partially or wholly with debt financing and our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital. 
 Our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will be, at least in part, dependent on continued stable global economic conditions. 
 Our total liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 746.4 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 583.2 million, long-term investments of 49.7 million and 113.5 million available under our ABL Facility. As of September 30, 2024, no loans were outstanding under the ABL Facility and there were 2.5 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the ABL Facility. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased in the open market and extinguished approximately 8.8 million principal amount of our Notes at a discount to par value. In connection with the extinguishment of our Notes, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 0.1 million, which is included in interest expense in the Condensed Statements of Operations. In addition, in the third quarter of 2023, we retired approximately 146.1 million of our Notes and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 11.7 million, which represents a premium paid to retire the debt, accelerated amortization of debt discount, net and fees incurred in connection with the transaction. 
 
 In the future, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional Notes in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, if any, and other factors. 
 We are responsible for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended. Beginning on April 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018, we were insured under a guaranteed cost insurance policy, through a third-party insurance carrier, for black lung claims raised by any employee subsequent to the acquisition of certain assets of Walter Energy. Beginning on June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2020, we had a deductible policy under which we were responsible for the first 0.5 million for each black lung claim. From June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2024, we had a deductible policy under which we were responsible for the first 1.0 million for each black lung claim. Beginning June 1, 2024, we have a deductible policy where we are responsible for the first 2.0 million for each black lung claim. 
 In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of Walter Energy, we assumed all black lung liabilities of Walter Energy and its U.S. subsidiaries incurred prior to March 31, 2016, for which we are self-insured. We have posted 18.6 million in surety bonds and 9.4 million of collateral recognized as short-term investments in addition to maintaining a 
 26 

black lung trust of 2.1 million that was acquired from Walter Energy. We received a letter from the U.S. Department of Labor ("DOL") on February 21, 2020 under its new process for self-insurance renewals that would require us to increase the amount of collateral posted to 39.8 million, but we have appealed such increase. We received another letter from the DOL on December 8, 2021 requesting additional information to support our appeal of the collateral requested by the DOL. On February 9, 2022, the DOL held a conference call with representatives from the Company related to our appeal. On July 12, 2022, we received a decision on our appeal from the DOL lowering the amount of collateral required to be posted from 39.8 million to 28 million. We appealed this decision. In addition, on January 19, 2023, the DOL proposed revisions to regulations under the Black Lung Benefits Act governing authorization of self-insurers. The proposed rules require, among other requirements, all self-insured operators to post security equal to 120 percent of their projected black lung liabilities. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide surety bonds and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit with parties for post-mining reclamation at all of our mining operations totaling 46.3 million, 18.6 million as collateral for self-insured black lung related claims and 5.2 million for miscellaneous purposes. 
 We believe that our future cash flows from operations, together with cash on our balance sheet and proceeds from the borrowings under our ABL Facility, will provide adequate resources to fund our debt service payments and planned operating and capital expenditure needs, including the development of Blue Creek, for at least the next twelve months and beyond. 
 The Company's principal contractual commitments include repayments of long-term debt and related interest, potential minimum throughput payments associated with our rail and port providers, asset retirement obligation payments, black lung obligation payments, payments on various coal and land leases, payments under financing lease obligations and payments associated with our natural gas swap contracts. Currently, there are no known trends or expected changes anticipated in future periods that would not be indicative of past results for our contractual commitments. 
 Refer to the respective notes to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our 2023 Annual Report for further information about our credit facilities and long-term debt (Note 13), commitments and contingencies (Note 15), asset retirement obligations (Note 8), black lung obligations (Note 10), lease payment obligations (Note 14), stock repurchase programs (Note 16) and derivative instruments (Note 17). 
 If our cash flows from operations are less than we require, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. From time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, (iii) the current state of the global economy and (iv) restrictions in our ABL Facility, the indenture governing the Notes (the "Indenture"), and any other existing or future debt agreements. There can be no assurance that we will have or continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 
 Statements of Cash Flows 
 Cash balances were 583.2 million and 738.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The following table sets forth, a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the period (in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 313,241 456,018 Net cash used in investing activities (395,807) (344,752) Net cash used in financing activities (64,987) (253,935) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (147,553) (142,670) 
 27 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for noncash items, such as depreciation and depletion of property, plant and equipment and mineral interests, deferred income tax expense, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount, accretion of asset retirement obligations, loss on early extinguishment of debt and changes in net working capital. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 313.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily attributed to net income of 249.5 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of 114.8 million, stock based compensation expense of 15.1 million, deferred income tax expense of 3.4 million, accretion of asset retirement obligations of 3.9 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of 1.2 million, and an increase in our net working capital of 52.6 million since December 31, 2023. The increase in our working capital was primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable due to higher sales volumes. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 456.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily attributed to net income of 349.8 million adjusted for depreciation and depletion expense of 101.8 million, deferred income tax expense of 52.4 million, stock based compensation expense of 14.5 million, loss on early extinguishment of debt of 11.7 million, accretion of asset retirement obligations of 2.9 million, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of 1.7 million, and an increase in our net working capital of 84.6 million since December 31, 2022. The increase in our working capital was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses offset partially by a decrease in inventories. The increase in trade accounts receivable reflected higher sales volumes and the timing of sales and the decrease in inventories is due to greater sales volumes than production. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 395.8 million and 344.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to purchases of property, plant and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and mine development. Capital expenditures for the development of Blue Creek were 246.4 million and 191.3 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The current year also includes the purchase of 49.7 million of long-term investments. The prior year period includes 2.4 million cash paid to acquire the remaining ownership interest in gas wells owned by an independent third party. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 65.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the payment of regular quarterly and special dividends of 40.5 million, principal repayments of finance lease obligations of 12.7 million and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of 11.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities was 253.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to retirements of debt related to our Notes of 162.4 million, payment of regular quarterly and special dividends of 57.4 million, principal repayments of finance lease obligations of 25.0 million and payment for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of 9.2 million. 
 
 Capital Allocation Policy 
 On May 17, 2017, the Board adopted the Capital Allocation Policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share. In February 2022, we announced that the Board approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend by 20 , from 0.05 per share to 0.06 per share. In February 2023, we announced that the Board approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend by 17 , from 0.06 per share to 0.07 per share. On February 9, 2024, we announced the Board approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend by 14 from 0.07 per share to 0.08 per share and declared a special cash dividend of 0.50 per share. Our strategy continues to be focused on optimizing our capital structure to improve returns to stockholders, through special cash dividends, while allowing flexibility for us to develop our strategic growth project Blue Creek. We intend on returning cash to stockholders in stronger price markets where we are generating significant amounts of cash flow, and less cash to stockholders during weaker markets. We also intend on using stock repurchases when there is no short- or long-term use for additional cash that will deliver meaningful value to stockholders. We have paid a regular quarterly cash dividend every quarter since the Board adopted the Capital Allocation Policy. 
 The Capital Allocation Policy states the following: In addition to the regular quarterly dividend and to the extent that the Company generates excess cash that is beyond the then current requirements of the business, the Board may consider returning all or a portion of such excess cash to stockholders through a special dividend or implementation of a stock repurchase program. Any future dividends or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of the Board and subject to consideration of a number of factors, including business and market conditions, future financial performance and other strategic 
 28 

investment opportunities. The Company will also seek to optimize its capital structure to improve returns to stockholders while allowing flexibility for the Company to pursue selective strategic growth opportunities that can provide compelling stockholder returns. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have paid 40.5 million of regular quarterly and special cash dividends under the Capital Allocation Policy . 
 
 Regular Quarterly Dividend 
 On February 9, 2024, our Board approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend by 14 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.08 per share, totaling approximately 4.2 million, which was paid February 26, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 20, 2024. 
 On April 25, 2024, our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.08 per share, totaling approximately 4.2 million, which was paid May 13, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 6, 2024. 
 On July 26, 2024, our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.08 per share, totaling approximately 4.2 million, which was paid August 13, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 6, 2024. 
 On October 25, 2024, our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.08 per share, totaling approximately 4.2 million, which will be paid November 12, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 5, 2024. 
 Special Dividend 
 On February 13, 2023, our Board declared a special cash dividend of 0.88 per share, totaling approximately 46.4 million, which was paid on March 7, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 28, 2023. 
 On February 9, 2024, our Board declared a special cash dividend of 0.50 per share, totaling approximately 26.3 million, which was paid on March 7, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2024. 
 
 ABL Facility 
 The ABL Facility will mature on December 6, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, no loans were outstanding under the ABL Facility and there were 2.5 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the ABL Facility. At September 30, 2024, we had 113.5 million of availability under the ABL Facility. 
 Revolving loan (and letter of credit) availability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which at any time is equal to the sum of certain eligible billed and unbilled accounts, certain eligible inventory, certain eligible supplies inventory and qualified cash, in each case, subject to specified advance rates. The borrowing base availability is subject to certain reserves, which may be established by the agent in its reasonable credit discretion. The reserves may include rent reserves, lower of cost or market reserve, port charges reserves and any other reserves that the Agent determines in its reasonable credit judgment to the extent such reserves relate to conditions that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the value of the collateral included in the borrowing base. 
 Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus a credit adjustment spread, ranging currently from approximately 11 bps to 43 bps depending on the interest period selected by us, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus, in each case of the foregoing (i) and (ii), an applicable margin, which is determined based on the average availability of the commitments under the ABL Facility, ranging currently from 150 bps to 200 bps or 50 bps to 100 bps, respectively. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a fee in respect of unutilized commitments, which is based on the availability of the commitments under the ABL Facility, ranging from 25 bps to 37.5 bps. We are also required to pay a fee on amounts available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility at a rate not in excess of 200 bps, and certain administrative fees. 
 The ABL Facility contains customary covenants for asset-based credit agreements of this type, including among other things: (i) requirements to deliver financial statements, other reports and notices; (ii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of certain indebtedness; (iii) restrictions on the existence or incurrence of certain liens; (iv) restrictions on making certain restricted payments; (v) restrictions on making certain investments; (vi) restrictions on certain mergers, consolidations and asset dispositions; (vii) restrictions on certain transactions with affiliates; and (viii) restrictions on modifications to certain 
 29 

indebtedness. Additionally, the ABL Facility contains a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, which ratio is tested if availability under the ABL Facility is less than a certain amount. As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to this covenant. Subject to customary grace periods and notice requirements, the ABL Facility also contains customary events of default. 
 We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the ABL Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 On December 6, 2021, we issued 350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875 senior secured notes due 2028 (the Notes at an initial price of 99.343 of their face amount. The Notes were issued to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption of all of our outstanding 8.00 senior secured notes due 2024 (the Existing Notes ), including payment of the redemption premium in connection with such redemption. 
 The Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 7.875 per year from December 6, 2021. Interest on the Notes will be payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2022. The Notes will mature on December 1, 2028. 
 Offers to Purchase the Notes 
 On August 9, 2023, we commenced an offer to purchase (the Restricted Payment Offer ), in cash, up to 150,000,000 principal amount of our outstanding Notes, at a repurchase price of 103 of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such Notes to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the Restricted Payment Repurchase Price ). Concurrently with, but separate from, the Restricted Payment Offer, we commenced a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer and, together with the Restricted Payment Offer, the Offers to purchase up to 150,000,000 principal amount of the Notes at a repurchase price of 104.25 of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the TO Repurchase Price ). The Offers expired on September 7, 2023 (the Expiration Date ). 
 Restricted Payment Offer 
 
 As of the Expiration Date, 200,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Restricted Payment Offer. Pursuant to the terms of the Restricted Payment Offer: 
 (1) an automatic pro ration factor of 49.5674 was applied to the 200,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Restricted Payment Offer (rounded down to avoid the purchase of Notes in a principal amount other than in integrals of 1,000), which resulted in 99,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the RP Pro-Rated Tendered Notes 
 (2) we accepted all 99,000 aggregate principal amount of the RP Pro-Rated Tendered Notes for payment of the Restricted Payment Repurchase Price in cash; and 
 (3) the remaining balance of 101,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes tendered that were not RP Pro-Rated Tendered Notes were not accepted for payment and were returned to the tendering holder of the Notes. 
 We consummated the Restricted Payment Offer on September 8, 2023. 
 Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we will have the ability from time to time in the future to make one or more restricted payments (the "Proposed Restricted Payment") in the form of special dividends to holders of our common stock and/or repurchases of our common stock in the aggregate amount of up to 299,901,000 consistent with the terms of the Capital Allocation Policy adopted by our Board. Any future Proposed Restricted Payments will be at the discretion of the Board and subject to a number of factors and there can be no assurance that we will make any Proposed Restricted Payments in the future.

Tender Offer 
 As of the Expiration Date, 294,770,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer. Pursuant to the terms of the Tender Offer: 
 (1) an automatic pro ration factor of 49.5674 was applied to the 294,770,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offer (rounded down to avoid the purchase of Notes in a principal amount other than in integrals of 1,000), which resulted in 146,002,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the TO Pro-Rated Tendered Notes 
 (2) we accepted all 146,002,000 aggregate principal amount of the TO Pro-Rated Tendered Notes for payment of the TO Repurchase Price in cash; and 
 (3) the remaining balance of 148,768,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes tendered that were not TO Pro-Rated Tendered Notes were not accepted for payment and were returned to the tendering holder of the Notes. 
 We consummated the Tender Offer on September 11, 2023. 
 In connection with the payments for the RP Pro-Rated Tendered Notes and the TO Pro-Rated Tendered Notes, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 11.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our mining operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance our operations and to comply with environmental regulations. Maintaining and expanding mines and related infrastructure is capital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of met coal reserves, mining costs, the maintenance of machinery and equipment and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require ongoing capital expenditures. The cost of our capital expenditures are also impacted by inflation and any prolonged inflation could result in higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. While a significant amount of the capital expenditures required at our mines has been spent, we must continue to invest capital to maintain our production. In addition, any decisions to increase production at our mines and the development of the high-quality met coal recoverable reserves at Blue Creek could also affect our capital needs or cause future capital expenditures to be higher than in the past and/or higher than our estimates. 
 To fund our capital expenditures, we may be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or sell equity securities. Our ability to obtain bank financing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our current or future debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties, that are beyond our control. 
 Our capital expenditures were 326.5 million and 310.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures for these periods are primarily related to investments required to develop Blue Creek and Mine No. 4 North as well as expenditures necessary to maintain our property, plant and equipment. Capital expenditures for the development of Blue Creek for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 246.4 million and 612.4 million has been spent on this project to date. Our deferred mine development costs were 19.5 million and 31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and relate to the development of Blue Creek and Mine No. 4 North. 
 Our capital spending is expected to range from 435.0 million to 500.0 million for the full year 2024, consisting of sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 100.0 to 110.0 million and discretionary capital expenditures of approximately 335.0 to 390.0 million for the development of Blue Creek and Mine No. 4 North. Our sustaining capital expenditures include expenditures related to longwall operations, continuous miners, new ventilation, and bleeder shafts. 
 
 Update on the Development of Blue Creek 
 On May 3, 2022, we announced the relaunch of the development of our Blue Creek mine, a strategic growth project that we expect will deliver significant future returns to stockholders. We believe that Blue Creek represents one of the few remaining untapped reserves of premium High Vol A steelmaking coal in the United States and that it has the potential to 
 31 

provide us with meaningful growth. We believe that the combination of low production costs and the high quality of the High Vol A steelmaking coal mined from Blue Creek, assuming we achieve our expected price realizations, will generate some of the highest steelmaking coal margins in the U.S., generate strong investment returns and achieve a rapid payback of our investment across a range of steelmaking coal price environments. 
 Our third-party reserve report indicates that, once developed, Blue Creek will produce a premium High Vol A steelmaking coal that is characterized by low-sulfur and high coke strength after reaction. High Vol A steelmaking coal has traditionally priced at a discount to the Australian Premium Low Vol and the U.S. Low Vol coals; however, we have observed extended periods in which they achieved a premium over these indices. We expect U.S. High Vol A coals will continue to become an important component of global steelmakers' coal blends due to their unique characteristics. In addition, we also expect that as the decade progresses, overall production and the supply of premium hard coking coals will be outpaced by the growth in demand coming from countries like India, Indonesia and Vietnam. This trend creates an opportunity for us to take advantage of favorable pricing dynamics driven by the projected tightness in supply and the desirable characteristics of our premium High Vol A steelmaking coal. 
 We believe that the execution risk of Blue Creek is lower than most projects of this size and nature due to utilizing highly experienced engineers with strong backgrounds in building new mines around the world to manage the project. The same highly experienced and knowledgeable engineers and familiar contractors who built mine infrastructure in recent years are being leveraged to build Blue Creek. 
 In 2023, we focused on the slope, return shaft, service shaft, bathhouse, warehouse, and substations. Also, in 2023, we initiated important and highly beneficial project scope changes that we expect will require incremental capital expenditures over the life of the project while lowering operating costs, increasing flexibility to manage risks, and making better use of multi-channel transportation methods. While we originally planned on a single channel to transport coal from the Blue Creek mine via an overland belt to a third-party owned and operated barge loadout facility, we are now constructing a belt conveyor system to a railroad loadout to transport the majority of the coal. We expect this change to de-risk the single channel to market, lower operating costs and move volumes faster to the port. We are also constructing and will operate a barge loadout ourselves rather than utilizing a third-party provider. We believe that the potential economic benefits associated with this scope change should provide us with an inherently robust and cost competitive outbound logistics model that will provide additional flexibility to manage alternative transportation methods. 
 The inclusion of the benefits and incremental capital expenditures relating to these specific scope changes are not expected to have a material impact on the project's economic metrics of net present value and internal rate of return and did not change the project timeline. In addition, we have experienced inflationary cost increases ranging from 25 to 35 , primarily in relation to labor, construction materials, and certain equipment. Inflationary pressures are expected to continue during the remainder of the project development period. While cost inflation has impacted the cost of the project, these inflationary pressures are expected to be offset by an inflationary increase in the long-term price assumption for steelmaking coal. There have been no changes to the reset baseline total project cost since that initial disclosure in 2023. The reset baseline total project cost ranges from 995 million to 1.075 billion. 
 In 2024, we plan to continue to make significant progress on the major components for seam access, surface infrastructure and coal transportation. During the third quarter of 2024, we installed and commissioned the service cage, slope belt, slope car and raw coal belt, which allowed us to begin development of the initial longwall panel with the first continuous miner unit, producing 35 thousand metric tons during the quarter. We plan on adding two additional continuous miner units by the end of the year to continue the development of the longwall panel. On the surface infrastructure components, we continued to make significant progress on the construction of the preparation plant, which is projected to be online during the middle of 2025. On the coal transportation components, the construction of the 9.5 mile clean coal belt structure and the rail and barge loadouts remain on schedule. We are also focused on increasing the headcount at Blue Creek by approximately 100 employees by the end of year. We continue to work closely with contractors and vendors to overcome supply chain and labor shortages in the mining industry. To date, we have not incurred any significant barriers to keep us from hitting our targets. 
 We have invested approximately 612.4 million project to date, including 246.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. We expect to spend 325 to 375 million in 2024 on the continued development of Blue Creek and of the remaining capital expenditures, we generally expect to spend approximately 70 in 2025 and 30 in 2026. 
 The project remains on schedule with the longwall scheduled to start up in the second quarter of 2026. We expect to ramp up production through the development of the project. Specifically, we expect to produce approximately 200 thousand metric tons in 2024, approximately 900 thousand metric tons in 2025, approximately 2.7 million metric tons in 2026 and 
 32 

approximately 4.4 million metric tons in 2027. We do not expect the tons produced in 2024 and 2025 of approximately 1.1 million metric tons to be sold until the second half of 2025 when the preparation plant comes online. 
 If we are able to successfully develop Blue Creek, we expect that it will be a transformational investment for us. We expect that the new single longwall mine at Blue Creek will have the capacity to produce an average of 4.4 million metric tons per annum of premium High Vol A met coal over the first ten years of production, thereby increasing our annual production capacity by approximately 60 . We expect the addition of Blue Creek to enhance our already advantageous position on the global cost curve, improve our profitability and cash flow generation, and cement our position as a leading pure play steelmaking coal producer. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the period presented. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates. 
 Our most critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are based upon management s historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in the "Critical Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide surety bonds and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit with parties for post-mining reclamation at all of our U.S. mining operations totaling 46.3 million, for collateral for self-insured black lung related claims totaling 18.6 million and for miscellaneous purposes totaling 5.2 million. 
 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
 A summary of recently adopted accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 of the "Notes to Condensed Financial Statements" in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to commodity price risk on sales of steelmaking coal. We typically sell most of our steelmaking coal under fixed supply contracts primarily with indexed pricing terms and volume terms of up to one to three years. Sales commitments in the steelmaking coal market are typically not long-term in nature, and we are, therefore, subject to fluctuations in market pricing. 
 We occasionally enter into natural gas swap contracts to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows associated with the fluctuations in the price of natural gas related to our forecasted sales. Our natural gas swap contracts economically hedge certain risk but are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. All changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as other revenues in the Condensed Statements of Operations. Historically, all of our derivative instruments were entered into for hedging purposes rather than speculative trading. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no natural gas swap contracts outstanding. 
 33 

We have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production, such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and other items. We manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers. We historically have not entered into any derivative commodity instruments to manage the exposure to changing price risk for supplies. 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. We provide our products to customers based on an evaluation of the financial condition of our customers. In some instances, we require letters of credit, cash collateral or prepayments from our customers on or before shipment to mitigate the risk of loss. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition. We monitor the exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated allowance for credit losses was immaterial and did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Our Notes have a fixed rate of interest of 7.875 per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. 
 Our ABL Facility bears an interest rate equal to SOFR, plus a credit adjustment spread, ranging currently from 11 bps to 43 bps, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin, which is determined based on the average availability of the commitments under the ABL Facility, ranging currently from 150 bps to 200 bps or 50 bps to 100 bps, respectively. Any debt that we incur under the ABL Facility will expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase significantly in the future, our exposure to interest rate risk will increase. As of September 30, 2024, assuming we had 116.0 million outstanding under our ABL Facility, a 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense under the ABL Facility by approximately 1.1 million. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 We have exposure to inflation for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production, such as belt structure, roof bolts, cable, magnetite, rock dust and other supplies, plus labor and parts on repair and rebuild equipment. These inflationary pressures have contributed to rising costs for us and may continue to do so in the future. We are applying a number of different strategies to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operations, including placing purchase orders earlier, utilizing short-term contracts and leveraging our supplier relationships. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 34 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 35 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a description of current legal proceedings, which is incorporated by reference in this Part II, Item 1. 
 We and our subsidiaries are parties to a number of other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. We record costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted with certainty as any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, any one of which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. However, the risks described in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also become material and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

Exhibit 95 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Mine Safety and Health Administration Safety Data 
 Warrior Met Coal, Inc. we , our , or the Company is committed to the safety of its employees and the goal of providing an incident-free workplace. To that end, the Company has in place health and safety programs that include regulatory-based training, accident prevention, workplace inspection, emergency preparedness response, accident investigations, and program auditing. These programs are designed to comply with regulatory mining-related coking coal safety and environmental standards. Additionally, the programs provide a basis for promoting a best-in-industry safety practice. 
 The operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). MSHA inspects our mines on a continual basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. As required by Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, each operator of a coal or other mine is required to include certain mine safety results in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Within this disclosure, we present information regarding certain mining safety and health citations which MSHA has issued with respect to our mining operations. In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the coal mine, (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed and, in that process, are sometimes dismissed and remaining citations are often reduced in severity and civil penalty amount. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s mining complexes received written notice from MSHA of (i) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act or (ii) the potential to have such a pattern. 
 The first table below presents the total number of specific citations and orders issued by MSHA to the Company and its subsidiaries, together with the total dollar value of the proposed MSHA civil penalty assessments received, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The second table presents legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission FMSHRC for each of our mines as of September 30, 2024, together with the number of legal actions initiated and the number of legal actions resolved during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

(1) MSHA assigns an identification number to each coal mine and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities such as preparation plants. We are providing the information in the table by mining complex rather than MSHA identification number because we believe that this presentation is more useful to investors. For descriptions of each of these mining operations, please refer to the descriptions under Part 1, Item 1. Business and Part 1, Item 2. Properties in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Idle facilities are not included in the table above unless they received a citation, order or assessment by MSHA during the current quarterly reporting period or are subject to pending legal actions. 
 (2) Not all citations issued during the quarter have been assessed a civil penalty. Thus, amounts listed under this heading are based on assessments that have been proposed, projected proportionally for all enforcement actions issued during the quarter, both Significant and Substantial S and non-S&S, regardless of the issuance date of the related citation or order. 
 (3) The table includes references to specific sections of the Mine Act as follows 

Section 104(a) Citations include citations for health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to serious injury if left unabated. 
 Section 104(b) Orders represent failures to abate a citation under 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA and that the period of time prescribed for the abatement should not be further extended. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 
 Section 104(d) Citations and Orders are for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health and safety standards where such violation is of such a nature as could significantly or substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard. 
 Section 110(b)(2) Violations are for flagrant violations. 
 Section 107(a) Orders are for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger existed.

 (1) Effective January 27, 2011, the SEC adopted amendments to its rules to implement Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the final rule ). The final rule modified previous reporting requirements and requires that the total number of legal actions pending before the FMSHRC as of the last day of the time period covered by the report be categorized according to type of proceeding, in accordance with the categories established in the Procedural Rules of FMSHRC. SEC rules require that six different categories of pending legal actions be disclosed. The types of proceedings are listed as follows 
 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart B These legal actions include proceedings initiated under FMSHRC Procedural Rule 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart B such as contests of citations and orders filed prior to receipt of a proposed penalty assessment from MSHA, contests related to orders for which penalties are not assessed (such as imminent danger orders under Section 107 of the Mine Act), and emergency response plan dispute proceedings. 
 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart C These legal actions include proceedings initiated under FMSHRC Procedural Rule 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart C and are contests of citations and orders after receipt of proposed penalties. For purposes of Subpart C, the Initiated During column consists of all Assessment Control Proceedings received during the quarter. Assessment Control Proceedings consist of 

proposed and contested civil penalty assessments bearing an Assessment Control Number (or A.C. Number ). Each Assessment Control Proceeding is subsequently assigned one or more dockets, each having its own unique docket number. Each docket is considered a separate matter and represented individually in the Pending as of and Resolved Dockets During columns. As one Assessment Control Proceeding can eventually correspond to multiple docket numbers, the numbers of proceedings may not be traceable throughout the various columns as the matters proceed. 
 
 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart D These legal actions include proceedings initiated under FMSHRC Procedural Rule 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart D and are complaints for compensation, which are cases under section 111 of the Mine Act. 
 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart E These legal actions include proceedings initiated under FMSHRC Procedural Rule 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart E and are complaints of discharge, discrimination or interference and temporary reinstatement under section 105 of the Mine Act. 
 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart F These legal actions include proceedings initiated under FMSHRC Procedural Rule 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart F such as applications for temporary relief under section 105(b)(2) of the Mine Act from any modification or termination of any order issued thereunder, or from any order issued under section 104 of the Mine Act (other than citations issued under section 104(a) or (f) of the Mine Act). 
 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart H These legal actions include proceedings initiated under FMSHRC Procedural Rule 29 CFR Part 2700, Subpart H and are appeals of judges decisions or orders to FMSHRC, including petitions for discretionary review and review by FMSHRC on its own motion.
