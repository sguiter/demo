 impairment charges. Indefinite-lived intangibles are carried at the initially recorded fair value less any recognized impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles are tested at least annually for impairment. Impairment assessments are conducted more frequently if certain conditions exist, including a change in the competitive landscape, any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies, or a significant change in the marketplace, including changes in the size of the market for the Company s products. In performing the impairment test, the Company estimates the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and compares it to the carrying value. If they carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the Company records an impairment loss for the difference.

The acquisition brings us novel technology enhancing our efforts on Allo-Evasion TM and a newly expanded pipeline incorporating additional preclinical-stage programs from Clade s iT platform spanning across cancer and autoimmune diseases. The results of Clade s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date. A total of common shares were issued to the Clade shareholders on the date of close, which were valued based on the closing price of common stock on that date. Contingent consideration was estimated at fair value on the date of the close and consists of both additional stock consideration Holdback Shares as well as a contingent milestone payment of ,000 Clade Milestone ). The Holdback Shares total up to shares of common stock consideration which will be issued and delivered to the sellers on the anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to potential reduction based on indemnification claims favoring the Company, if any. This contingent consideration was recorded at fair value as of the closing date, based on the closing stock price on that date, adjusted for a discount for lack of marketability, and totaled ,600. Contingent consideration also includes the Clade Milestone, which consists of one potential clinical development milestone payment of ,000, which may be paid in cash, shares, or a combination thereof, upon the achievement of the milestone. The fair value of this contingent consideration was estimated based on the probability of milestone achievement, and an estimated discount rate, and totaled ,100. The Company recognized of acquisition-related costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were expensed as incurred in the consolidated statement of operations.

The fair value of the IPR D was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method, which the Company estimates future cash flows attributable to the technology and applies a probability of success and a discount rate of . These nonrecurring fair value measurements are Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company believes the goodwill related to the acquisition was attributable to the expected synergies and value of the assembled workforce as well as the collective experience of the management team with regards to its operations.

For fixed maturity securities, losses in fair value are viewed as temporary if the fixed maturity security can be held to maturity and it is reasonable to assume that the issuer will be able to service the debt, both as to principal and interest. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and available-for-sale investment debt securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses, respectively. Unrealized losses on corporate debt securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers bonds are of high credit quality (rated BBB+ or higher) and the decline in fair value is largely due to market conditions and or changes in interest rates. Management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to the anticipated recovery of their amortized cost basis. The issuers continue to make timely payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity.

The Company identified the following commitments under the arrangement: (i) research and development services R D Services under each of the initial Collaboration Programs and (ii) Bristol-Myers Squibb s License Option to elect to exclusively license the Development Candidates for each of the initial Collaboration Programs. The Company determined that these commitments represent distinct performance obligations for purposes of recognizing revenue and will recognize revenue as the Company fulfills each performance obligation. The Company determined that the upfront payment and Equity Premium constitute the transaction price at the inception of the Collaboration Agreement. The future potential development and regulatory milestone payments were fully constrained at contract inception as the risk of significant revenue reversal related to these amounts has not yet been resolved. The achievement of the future potential milestones is not within the Company s control and is subject to certain research and development success and therefore carries significant uncertainty. The Company will reevaluate the likelihood of achieving these milestones at the end of each reporting period and adjust the transaction price in the period the risk is resolved. In addition, the Company will recognize any consideration related to sales-based milestones and royalties when the subsequent sales occur.

 was allocated to the performance obligations based on their estimated standalone selling price on January 7, 2022. The stand-alone selling price of the research and development services was estimated using the expected cost-plus margin approach, and the stand-alone selling price of the License Options was based on a discounted cash flow approach and considered several factors including, but not limited to, discount rate, development timeline, regulatory risks, estimated market demand, and future revenue potential using an adjusted market approach. The allocated transaction price is recognized as revenue in one of two ways: Research and development services: The Company recognizes the portion of the transaction price allocated to each of the research and development performance obligations as the research and development services are provided, using an inputs method, in proportion to costs incurred to date for each research development target as compared to total costs incurred and expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the underlying obligation related to each research and development target. The transfer of control occurs over this period and, in management s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. License option rights: The transaction price allocated to the license options rights, which are considered material rights to license and commercialize the underlying research and development target, are deferred until the period that Bristol-Myers Squibb elects to exercise or elects to not exercise its option or when the option to exercise expires.

The number of shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance under the 2021 Incentive Plan shall be increased, upon approval by the Board of Directors, on January 1, 2022 and each January 1 thereafter, in an amount equal to the least of (i) five percent of the outstanding common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, or (ii) such number of common stock determined by the Board of Directors no later than the immediately preceding December 31. For 2023, the 2021 Incentive Plan reserved shares were increased under clause (i) by shares, effective as of January 1, 2023. For 2024, the 2021 Incentive Plan reserved shares were increased under clause (i) by shares, effective as of January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares available for issuance under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The Company s stock-based awards are subject to service-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and directors with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Stock awards granted typically vest over a period but may be granted with different vesting terms. The Company may also issue awards with performance-based vesting conditions. For performance-based awards, the Company would reassess at each reporting date whether achievement of the performance condition is probable and accrue compensation expense if and when the achievement of the performance condition is probable. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company issued performance-based RSUs that represent a contingent right to receive share of the Company s common stock. The RSUs shall vest on November 1, 2023, with the remaining vesting upon the earlier of: (i) November 1, 2024; and (ii) satisfaction of certain performance criteria. The Company is currently recording expense for these RSUs on the straight-line basis. The Company recognizes the costs of the stock-based payments as the employees vest in the awards.

As of September 30, 2024, there was of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options with time-based vesting terms, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. The aggregate intrinsic value of options vested and exercisable as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock. The intrinsic value of options exercised in 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of its option awards to employees and directors using Black-Scholes, which requires inputs and subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the calculation of the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate and (iv) expected dividends. Due to the lack of substantial company-specific historical and implied volatility data of its common stock, the Company has based its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar public companies. Starting in June of 2023 the Company had sufficient historical information regarding stock trading history, and started to use the Company s own stock volatility. The Company has never paid dividends and does not expect to in the foreseeable future. The expected term of the options granted to employees is derived from the simplified method as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 relating to stock-based compensation. The risk-free interest rates for periods within expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. The Company will account for actual forfeitures as they occur. The weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock options granted are as follows: Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement to support the expansion of CNTY-101 in autoimmune indications and for working capital and general corporate purposes. of its existing leased lab facilities in Philadelphia. The company concluded it would exit one of the leases early and as a result the Company completed an impairment analysis of its right of use asset related to this lease along with the related property and equipment at this facility. The Company reviewed its long-lived assets for impairment following Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 for Property, Plant, and Equipment. The Company evaluated its long-lived assets for recoverability due to changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company reviewed its property and equipment related assets for impairment by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Impairment charge was calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and fair value as discounted cash flows, indicative fair market quotes received which are considered level three fair value estimates.

Overview We are an innovative biotechnology company harnessing the power of adult stem cells to develop curative cell therapy products for cancer and autoimmune diseases that we believe will allow us to overcome the limitations of first-generation cell therapies. We have created a comprehensive, genetically engineered allogeneic cell therapy platform that includes: Industry-leading induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs and differentiated know-how to generate immune effector cells from iPSCs iPSC-derived cells Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR mediated precision gene editing that allows us to incorporate multiple transgenes and remove target genes intended to optimize cell product performance; Sophisticated protein engineering capabilities to develop proprietary next generation chimeric antigen receptors CARs Our proprietary Allo-Evasion TM technology intended to prevent rejection of our cell products by the host immune system; and Cutting edge manufacturing capabilities intended to minimize product development and supply risk. We are leveraging our expertise in cellular reprogramming, genetic engineering, and manufacturing to develop therapies with the potential to overcome many of the challenges inherent to cell therapy and provide a significant advantage over existing cell therapy technologies. We believe that these vertically integrated capabilities will allow us to further expand our existing pipeline and develop therapeutics from iPSC-derived natural killer cells iNK cells and iPSC-derived T cells iT cells that may provide enhanced clinical outcomes compared to available therapeutic options. We believe our commitment to developing off-the-shelf cell therapies will expand patient access and provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance the course of treatment. Our vision is to become a premier fully integrated biotechnology company by developing and ultimately commercializing off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapies that dramatically and positively transform the lives of patients suffering from life-threatening cancers, as well as autoimmune diseases. To achieve our vision, we have assembled a world-class team with decades of collective experience in cell therapy and drug development, manufacturing, and commercialization.

 Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, conducting discovery and research activities, filing patent applications, identifying potential product candidates, conducting our ELiPSE-1 clinical trial, initiating our CALiPSO-1 clinical trial, undertaking preclinical studies, in-licensing intellectual property, and acquiring and integrating Clade Therapeutics. All of our programs are currently in the development stage, and we do not have any products approved for sale. Since our inception, we have incurred net losses each year. We had an accumulated deficit of 746.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs, the acquisition of in-process research and development and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. To date, we have funded our operations from the issuance and sale of our equity securities and the receipt of payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb, in connection with our collaborations as described below, and have not generated any revenues. Since our inception, through September 30, 2024, we have raised approximately 666 million in net proceeds from sales of our equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 52.6 million and investments of 192.1 million. In August 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA notified us that our ELiPSE-1 clinical trial may proceed to assess CNTY-101 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell malignancies. The Phase 1 trial, ELiPSE-1, is ongoing in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-cell malignancies. In December 2023, we announced preliminary clinical data from seven participants treated at the two lowest dose levels in the trial. In June 2024, we presented encouraging interim efficacy and safety data for 12 safety evaluable and 10 efficacy evaluable participants. We have evaluated dose escalation of CNTY-101 at schedule A (single dose per cycle) up to Dose Level 4 (3 billion cells) and schedule B (3 doses per cycle) up to Dose Level 3 (1 billion cells). As of the data snapshot October 15, 2024, eight additional participants have been treated with CNTY-101 for a total of 20 participants evaluable for safety and 19 for preliminary efficacy. In December 2023, we were notified by the FDA that the Phase 1 CALiPSO-1 clinical trial may proceed to assess CNTY-101 in participants with moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have failed at least two standard immunosuppressive therapies. We amended the clinical protocol in June 2024 to include a new indication-specific cohort of Lupus Nephritis (LN) patients. To further expand evaluation of CNTY-101 in autoimmune diseases, in September 2024, we amended the protocol to include two additional new indication-specific cohorts of diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc) and idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) patients. We have activated multiple clinical sites in the United States, and expect to activate additional sites in the coming months, with ability to enroll patients across indications. To further facilitate enrollment, we plan to expand trial sites to select European countries. In January 2023, we announced a strategic internal portfolio prioritization (the January 2023 Strategic Reprioritization through which, among other discovery efforts, CNTY-103, a CAR-iNK product targeting CD133 and a discovery program for hematological malignancies, were de-prioritized, allowing us to further prioritize our CNTY-102 and CNTY-107 product candidates, which we believe have a higher probability of technical success and greater market potential. As a result of the operational restructuring, lab operations in Seattle, Washington and Hamilton, Ontario, were closed and research activities have been consolidated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the second quarter of 2024, we announced plans to expand clinical development for CNTY-101 into additional autoimmune disease indications. To support these increased research and development activities in autoimmune diseases, in April 2024 we completed a private placement offering of our common stock to certain institutional investors and received 60 million in gross proceeds before deducting placement agent fees and other offering related expenses. Concurrently, we announced pipeline and platform enhancements through the acquisition of Clade Therapeutics, Inc. Clade ), a privately held biotechnology company focused on discovering and delivering engineerable, off-the-shelf, scalable, and consistent stem cell-based medicines, with a focus on iPSC-derived T cells. The acquisition brings us novel technology enhancing our efforts on Allo-Evasion TM and a newly expanded pipeline incorporating three additional preclinical-stage programs from Clade s iT platform spanning across cancer and autoimmune diseases. We will share what we believe to

Table of Contents 
 be the first presentation of iPSC-derived CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells that demonstrate function comparable to primary CAR-T cells at the 2024 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. Following the integration of Clade Therapeutics, we are conducting a strategic review of the pre-clinical pipeline to leverage the unique capabilities and technologies at Century towards high-value and differentiated programs. We expect to conclude and communicate the results of this review in the first quarter of 2025. As part of this review, in October, we implemented changes to the organization structure including elimination of overlapping technical and research capabilities to enhance ongoing efficiencies and alignment with the Company s key programs. With these changes, we have extended expected cash runway into the second half of 2026. Based on our current business plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of the date of this quarterly report will be sufficient for us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements into the second half of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We anticipate that our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially over the foreseeable future. The expected increase in expenses will be driven in large part by our ongoing activities, if and as we: continue to advance our iPSC cell therapy platforms; progress clinical development of CNTY-101 and continue preclinical development of our other product candidates; seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; expand and validate our own clinical-scale current good manufacturing practices cGMP ), facilities; seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; maintain, expand, protect, and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company; acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, which will require us to add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development and any future commercialization efforts; and increase our employee headcount and related expenses to support these activities. 
 We are also investing in building our capabilities in key areas of manufacturing sciences and operations, including development of our iPSC cell therapy platforms, product characterization, and process analytics from the time product candidates are in early research phases. Our investments also include scaled research solutions, scaled infrastructure, and novel technologies intended to improve efficiency, characterization, and scalability of manufacturing. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including funding for preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the commercialization of any approved product candidates. We intend to use the proceeds from such financings to, among other uses, fund research and development of our product candidates and development programs, including our pre-clinical and clinical development of CNTY-101, CNTY-102, CNTY-107, and CNTY-108, CNTY-308, CNTY-361, as well as CNTY-104 and CNTY-106 in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate significant product revenue, we expect to finance our operations with our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, any future equity or debt financings; upfront, and, milestone, and royalty payments, if any, received under current and future licenses or collaborations. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. License and collaboration agreements Bristol-Myers Squibb On January 7, 2022, we entered into the Research, Collaboration and License Agreement, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (the Collaboration Agreement ), to collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of iNK and iT cell programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors (the Collaboration Program ), and each product candidate (each, a Development Candidate ). We and Bristol-Myers Squibb will initially collaborate on two Collaboration Programs focused on acute myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma, and Bristol-Myers Squibb has the option to add up to two additional Collaboration Programs for an additional fee. We are responsible for generating Development Candidates for each Collaboration Program, and Bristol-Myers Squibb has the option to elect to exclusively license the Development Candidates for pre-clinical development, clinical development and commercialization on a worldwide basis. Following Bristol-Myers Squibb s exercise of the License Option, we will be responsible for performing IND-enabling studies, supporting Bristol-Myers Squibb s preparation and submission of an IND, and manufacturing of clinical supplies until completion of a proof of concept clinical trial. Bristol-Myers Squibb will be responsible for all regulatory, clinical, manufacturing (after the proof of concept clinical trial) and commercialization activities for such Development Candidates worldwide. We have the option to co-promote Development Candidates generated from certain specified Collaboration Programs. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb made a non-refundable, upfront cash payment of 100 million and will pay an exercise fee upon the exercise of the License Option, and product candidates developed under a Licensed Program (the Licensed Products ). For each Licensed Program, Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay up to 235 million in milestone payments upon the first achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and will pay up to 500 million per Licensed Product in net sales-based milestone payments. Bristol-Myers Squibb will also pay us tiered royalties per Licensed Product as a percentage of net sales in the high-single digits to low-teens, subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb purchased 2,160,760 shares of our common stock at a price per share of 23.14 for an aggregate purchase price of 50 million. We determined the common stock purchase represented a premium of 7.82 per share, or 23.2 million in the aggregate, and the remaining 26.8 million was recorded as issuance of common stock in stockholders equity. We identified the following commitments under the arrangement: (i) research and development services under each of the two initial Collaboration Programs and (ii) License Option to elect to exclusively license the Development Candidates for each of the two initial Collaboration Programs. We determined that these four commitments represent distinct performance obligations for purposes of recognizing revenue and will recognize revenue as we fulfill each performance obligation. Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Inc. (FCDI) On September 18, 2018, we entered into a license agreement (the Differentiation License ), with FCDI. The Differentiation License, as amended, provides us with an exclusive license under certain patents and know-how related to human iPSC consisting of cells that are or are modifications of NK cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages derived from human iPSC. In consideration for the Differentiation License, FCDI received 2,980,803 shares of common stock in connection with the January 2023 Strategic Reprioritization. Also on September 18, 2018, we entered into the non-exclusive license, (the Reprogramming License ), with FCDI. The Reprogramming License, as amended, provides us with a non-exclusive license under certain patents and know-how related to the reprogramming of human somatic cells to iPSCs and provide us access 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 to iPSC lines for clinical use. Under the Reprogramming License, we are required to make certain developmental and regulatory milestone payments as well as royalty payments upon commercialization in the low single digits. In connection with the Reprogramming License, we entered into a collaboration agreement (the FCDI Collaboration Agreement ), with FCDI pursuant to which we agreed to fund research and development work at FCDI pursuant to a research plan. On October 21, 2019, we entered into the FCDI Collaboration Agreement with FCDI, whereby FCDI provides certain services to us to develop and manufacture iPSCs and immune cells derived therefrom. Under the terms of the FCDI Collaboration Agreement, as amended, FCDI will provide services in accordance with the approved research plan and related research budget. The initial research plan covers the period from the date of execution of the FCDI Collaboration Agreement through March 31, 2022. On July 29, 2022, we amended the FCDI Collaboration Agreement to extend the term through September 30, 2025. On January 7, 2022, we and FCDI entered into a letter agreement, which amends each of the FCDI agreements as further discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, and in consideration for amending the FCDI Agreements, we agreed to pay to FCDI (i) an upfront payment of 10 million, (ii) a percentage of any milestone payments received by us under the Collaboration Agreement, in respect of achievement of development or regulatory milestones specific to Japan, and (iii) a percentage of all royalties received by us under the Collaboration Agreement in respect of sales of products in Japan. On September 22, 2023, we and FCDI entered into a worldwide license agreement whereby FCDI will grant non-exclusive licenses to us for certain patent rights and know-how related to cell differentiation and reprogramming for the development and commercialization of iPSC-derived therapies for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (the Autoimmune License ). Under the terms of the Autoimmune License, FCDI will be eligible to receive certain development and regulatory milestone payments as well as low single-digit royalties related to products developed in connection with the Autoimmune License. In addition, on September 22, 2023, we and FCDI amended the Reprogramming License, Differentiation License and the Collaboration Agreement to expand our existing license related to the development and commercialization of iPSC-derived cancer immunotherapeutic to also include inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made payments of 3.7 million and 6.6 million and incurred research and development expenses of 1.0 million and 6.3 million recorded within general and administrative expenses in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amounts paid to FCDI were immaterial From inception of the FCDI Collaboration Agreement through September 30, 2024, we incurred 42.6 million of expenses under the FCDI Collaboration Agreement. Components of operating results Collaboration revenue We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Our revenues to date have been generated through our collaboration, option and license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We recognize revenue over the expected performance period under this agreement. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from this agreement and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. To date, we have not received any royalties under any of our existing collaboration agreements.

 Operating expenses Research and development To date, research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery and development of our iPSC cell therapy platform technology and product candidates and acquired in-process research and development. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are recorded as prepaid expenses until the goods or services are received. Research and development expenses consist of personnel-related costs, including salaries, and benefits, stock compensation expense, external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, laboratory supplies, costs to acquire and license technologies facility and other allocated expenses, including rent, depreciation, and allocated overhead costs, and other research and development expenses. We deploy our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs for developing our iPSC cell therapy platforms, identifying and developing product candidates, and establishing manufacturing capabilities. Due to the number of ongoing projects and our ability to use resources across several projects, the vast majority of our research and development costs are not recorded on a program-specific basis. These include costs for personnel, laboratory, and other indirect facility and operating costs. Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development efforts including expanding the capabilities of our iPSC cell therapy platforms, identifying product candidates, progressing preclinical studies and clinical trials, including for our first clinical product candidate CNTY-101, seeking regulatory approval of our product candidates, and incurring costs to acquire and license technologies aligned with our goal of translating iPSCs to therapies. A change in the outcome of any of these variables could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates. General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and non-cash stock-based compensation, for our employees in executive, legal, finance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative functions, legal fees, consulting fees, recruiting costs, and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Legal fees include those related to corporate and patent matters. Interest expense Interest expense relates to interest incurred on the September 14, 2020 10.0 million Term Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement we entered into with Hercules Capital, Inc., as well as amortization of the related deferred financing cost. The loan was repaid in full in May 2023. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment balances. Income taxes We have incurred losses and recorded a full valuation allowance on all of our net deferred tax assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred or for the research and development tax credits generated in the U.S. due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. The tax provision recorded during the 2023 interim period primarily consisted of current federal and state tax expense resulting from revenue recognition for tax purposes from the Company's Research Collaboration and License Agreement entered into with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in 2022, combined with statutory limitations on deductions for research and development expenses, net operating losses, and research credits. Results of operations Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented:

The increase of 4.4 million was primarily due to: an increase in personnel-related expenses of 0.8 million, including an increase in salary and benefit expense of 0.6 million, and an increase in stock compensation expense of 0.2 million. This is primarily the result of the acquisition of Clade. an increase of 2.6 million in research and laboratory due to progression of ELiPSE-1 trial and start-up costs of CALiPSO-1 trial. An increase of 1.6 million in collaboration due to manufacturing our CNTY-101 product candidate performed under our collaboration with FCDI. 
 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses were 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 9.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a gain recognized on contingent consideration liabilities. Interest income Interest income was 3.3 million and 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which related to interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances.

 a decrease in personnel-related expenses of 0.8 million, including a decrease in salary and benefit expense of 0.3 million, and a decrease in stock compensation expense of 0.5 million. a decrease of 1.9 million of facility and other allocated costs, which consists of a decrease in rent of 1.1 million, and a decrease of facility services of 1.2 million. This was offset by an increase in depreciation of 0.5 million. An increase in collaboration of 4.2 million due to manufacturing our CNTY-101 product candidate performed under our collaboration with FCDI. 
 General and administrative expense General and administrative expenses were 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 26.1 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a gain recognized on contingent consideration liabilities. Interest expense Interest expense was 0.0 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which related to our Loan Agreement with Hercules. On May 1, 2023, we repaid the loan in its entirety and thus expect our interest expenses to decrease accordingly in subsequent periods. Interest income Interest income was 10.1 million and 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which related to interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances. The increase in our interest income was due to higher interest rates earned on average balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments. Liquidity, capital resources, and capital requirements Sources of liquidity To date, we have funded our operations from the issuance and sale of our equity securities, debt financing and collaboration revenues. Since our inception, we have raised approximately 666 million in net proceeds from the sales of our equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, and cash equivalents of 52.6 million and investments of 192.1 million. Based on our research and development plans, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements into the second half of 2026. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for a number of years, if ever. We had an accumulated deficit of 746.2 million as of September 30, 2024. In July 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC Cowen ), under which we may offer and sell, from time to time in our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 150 million through Cowen as sales agent. In February of 2024, 4,084,502 shares of common stock were issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement at a weighted-average price of 4.50 per share, resulting in approximately 18.4 million in gross proceeds. In April 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional accredited investors (the Investors ), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Investors in a private placement an aggregate of 15,873,011 shares of common stock (the Private Placement Shares ), at a price of 3.78 per share (the Private Placement ). We received aggregate gross proceeds from the Private Placement of approximately 60 million, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.

Table of Contents 
 Future funding requirements We expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future as we conduct and expand our research and development efforts, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, developing new product candidates, establishing internal and external manufacturing capabilities, and funding our operations generally. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including the commercialization of any approved product candidates. We are subject to the risks typically related to the development of new products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the scope, timing, progress, costs, and results of discovery, preclinical development, and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates; the number of clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our current and future product candidates; the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of any of our current and future product candidates; the cost of manufacturing clinical and commercial supplies of our current and future product candidates; the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; the costs and timing of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining, protecting, and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing upon, misappropriating, or violating their intellectual property rights; our ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing, or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty, or other payments due under any such agreement; the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; expenses to attract, hire and retain, skilled personnel; costs of operating as a public company; our ability to establish a commercially viable pricing structure and obtain approval for coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors; the effect of competing technological and market developments; and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies. 
 Until and unless we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through the proceeds from a combination of equity offerings and debt financings, and potentially through additional license and development agreements or strategic partnerships or collaborations with third parties. Financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. In addition, market volatility resulting from the effects of pandemics, inflationary pressures, disruptions of financial institutions, political unrest and hostilities, war or other factors could adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. We have no commitments for any additional financing and will likely be required to raise such financing through the sale of additional securities, which, in the case of equity securities, may occur at prices lower than the offering price of our common stock. If we sell equity or equity-linked securities, our current stockholders, may

 be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that are senior to or otherwise adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Moreover, if we issue debt, we may need to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to paying principal and interest on such debt and we may need to comply with operating restrictions, such as limitations on incurring additional debt, which could impair our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights which could impede our ability to conduct our business. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (85,912) (62,118) Investing activities 16,876 42,529 Financing activities 75,165 (9,369) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 6,129 (28,958) Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was 85.9 million and 62.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of our net loss of 90.5 million and a decrease of 11.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by non-cash charges of 15.7 million. The non-cash charges of 14.7 million consisted primarily of 10.0 million for depreciation expense, non-cash operating lease benefit of 0.4 million, a decrease in lease liability due to lease termination, and stock-based compensation expense of 10.0 million, partially offset by amortization of marketable securities of 3.8 million and gain on contingent consideration liability of 1.1 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a 3.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a 4.1 million decrease in operating lease liability, a 2.4 million decrease in deferred revenue, and a 1.8 million decrease in accounts payable. Net cash used in operating activities was 62.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily of our net loss of 97.3 million, partially offset by and an increase of 12.3 million in our net operating assets and liabilities and non-cash charges of 22.9 million. The non-cash charges of 22.9 million consisted of 9.5 million for depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense of 11.1 million, and impairment of 4.2 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the receipt of 11.7 million of tenant reimbursement, and a 1.7million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in deferred revenue. Investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities was 16.9 million and 42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of the sale of fixed maturity securities, available for sale of 128.6 million, which was partially offset by purchases of fixed maturity securities of 102.1 million, and the acquisition of Clade of 9.6 million. Cash provided by investing activities was 42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of the sale of fixed maturity securities, available for sale of 254.6 million, which was partially offset by purchases of fixed maturity securities of 199.3 million and acquisition of property and equipment of 12.8 million.

 Financing activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 75.2 million and 9.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities consisted of 17.8 million from proceeds from our at-the-market capital raise, 56.6 million from proceeds from our PIPE financing, and 0.7 million from issuance of our common stock from equity incentive plans pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash used in financing activities was 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities consisted of 10.2 million for payments on long term debt and offset by 0.9 million from issuance of our common stock from equity incentive plans pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options. Contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024: 

Payments Due by Period 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Total (in thousands) Operating leases 9,703 18,947 19,782 38,571 87,003 Payment obligations under our license, collaboration, and acquisition and merger agreements as of September 30, 2024 are contingent upon future events such as our achievement of pre-specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, or royalties on net product sales. As of September 30, 2024, the timing and likelihood of achieving the milestones and success payments and generating future product sales are uncertain and therefore, any related payments are not included in the table above. We also enter into agreements in the normal course of business for sponsored research, preclinical studies, contract manufacturing, and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice. These obligations and commitments are not included in the table above. See Note 9 Commitments and contingencies for additional information. We have commitments under operating leases for certain facilities used in our operations. JOBS Act accounting election As a company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As such, we may take advantage of reduced disclosure and other requirements otherwise generally applicable to public companies, including: not being required to have our registered independent public accounting firm attest to management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; presenting reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; not being required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and, extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

47 

Table of Contents 
 The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards at the time private companies adopt the new or revised accounting standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to opt out of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2026, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of our critical accounting policies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024, except as noted above. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. We do not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and do not engage in any hedging activities as part of our normal course of business. Interest rate risk We had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of 52.6 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of bank deposits and money market funds. We also had investments of 192.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However, because of the low risk profile of the instruments in our portfolio, a change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.

 Banking Instability Future disruptions of financial institutions where we bank or have credit arrangements, or disruptions of the financial services industry in general, could adversely affect our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents. Effects of Inflation Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and laboratory consumables. We believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our financial statements. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosures controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management determined that, as of September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months then ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors Other than what is set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

 11. Section 409A .
 (a) The parties intend for this Agreement to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and all provisions of this Agreement will be interpreted and applied accordingly. 

 -5- 

Nonetheless, the Company does not guaranty the tax treatment of any compensation payable to Executive.
 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no portion of the benefits or payments to be made under Section 10(a) above will be payable until Executive has a separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. In addition, to the extent compliance with the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(2) (or any successor provision) is necessary to avoid the application of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code to payments due to Executive upon or following his separation from service, then notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (or any otherwise applicable plan, policy, agreement or arrangement), any such payments that are otherwise due within six months following Executive s separation from service (taking into account the preceding sentence of this paragraph) will be deferred without interest and paid to Executive in a lump sum immediately following that six month period. This paragraph should not be construed to prevent the application of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (or any successor provision) to amounts payable hereunder. For purposes of the application of Section 409A of the Code, each payment in a series of payments will be deemed a separate payment.
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent an expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Executive in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
 12. Section 280G . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement (or any plan, policy, agreement or other arrangement covering Executive), if any payment, right or benefit paid, provided or due to Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (each, a Payment, and collectively, the Total Payments ), would subject Executive to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the Excise Tax, but only if (i) the amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced, is greater than or equal to (ii) the amount of such Total Payments without reduction (in each case, determined on an after-tax basis). Any reduction of the Total Payments required by this paragraph will be implemented by determining the Parachute Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then by reducing the Payments in order, beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Ratio. For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio, later Payments will be reduced before earlier Payments. For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio and the same time of payment, each Payment will be reduced proportionately. For purposes of this paragraph, Parachute Ratio means a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment, as calculated for purposes of Section 

 -6- 

280G of the Code, and (y) the denominator of which is the economic value of the applicable Payment.

For avoidance of doubt, a termination of Executive s employment due to his Disability will not constitute a termination without Cause.

through the date of such cessation of employment at the time such Base Salary would otherwise be paid according to the Company s usual payroll practices; 
 (ii) to the extent then unpaid, the Company shall pay to Executive the annual bonus (if any) earned with respect to the fiscal year ended immediately prior to the cessation of Executive s employment; 
 (iii) the Company shall make monthly severance payments equal to one-twelfth of Executive s Base Salary as in effect immediately prior to such cessation of employment (or, if such cessation is due to the Good Reason described in clause (ii) of that definition, the Base Salary in effect immediately prior to such material diminution) for a period equal to the Severance Per iod; 
 (iv) if Executive validly elects to receive continuation coverage under the Company s group health plan (if any) pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 COBRA ), the Company shall reimburse Executive for the 2 COBRA administrative fee plus the applicable premium otherwise payable for COBRA continuation coverage for himself and his eligible dependents for the Severance Period, to the extent such premium exceeds the monthly amount charged to active similarly-situated employees of the Company for the same coverage; and 
 
 (v) to the extent such cessation of employment occurs within three (3) months prior to or twelve (12) months following a Change in Control (as defined below), (x) the Company shall pay to Executive an amount equal to the Target Bonus, and (y) all outstanding equity awards that are subject to vesting solely based on the passage of time and Executive s continued employment shall become vested upon the later of the date of Executive s cessation of employment and the Change in Control. 
 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9(a) , all compensation and benefits will cease at the time of Executive s cessation of employment and the Company will have no further liability or obligation by reason of such cessation of employment. The payments and benefits described in this Section 9(a) are in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other severance arrangement maintained by the Company. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the payments and benefits described in Section 9(a)(ii) - 9(a)(v) are conditioned on Executive s execution and delivery to the Company and the expiration of all applicable statutory revocation periods, by the 60 th day following the effective date of Executive s cessation of employment, of a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliates (which shall have customary exclusions relating to Executive s equity in the Company, any claims that Executive may have relating to accrued vested benefits under the Company s benefit plans, subject to the terms and conditions of such plans, and any claims for indemnification in Executive s role as an officer and director of the Company) in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company (the Release and on Executive s continued compliance with the provisions of the Restrictive Covenant Agreement (defined below).

(b) Other Terminations. If Executive s employment with the Company ceases for any reason other than as described in Section 9(a) above (including but not limited to (i) termination by the Company for Cause or (ii) resignation by Executive without Good Reason, or (iii) termination as a result of Executive s Disability, or (iv) Executive s death), then the Company s obligation to Executive will be limited solely to the payment of accrued and unpaid Base Salary through the date of such cessation of employment. All compensation and benefits will cease at the time of such cessation of employment and, except as otherwise provided by COBRA, the Company will have no further liability or obligation by reason of such termination. The foregoing will not be construed to limit Executive s right to payment or reimbursement for claims incurred prior to the date of such termination under any insurance contract funding an employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement of the Company in accordance with the terms of such insurance contract. 
 10. Section 409A. 
 (a) The parties intend for this Agreement to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and all provisions of this Agreement will be interpreted and applied accordingly. Nonetheless, the Company does not guaranty the tax treatment of any compensation payable to Executive. 
 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no portion of the benefits or payments to be made under Section 9(a) above will be payable until Executive has a separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. In addition, to the extent compliance with the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(2) (or any successor provision) is necessary to avoid the application of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code to payments due to Executive upon or following his separation from service, then notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (or any otherwise applicable plan, policy, agreement or arrangement), any such payments that are otherwise due within six months following Executive s separation from service (taking into account the preceding sentence of this paragraph) will be deferred without interest and paid to Executive in a lump sum immediately following that six month period. This paragraph should not be construed to prevent the application of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) (or any successor provision) to amounts payable hereunder. For purposes of the application of Section 409A of the Code, each payment in a series of payments will be deemed a separate payment. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent an expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the 

Code: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Executive in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (iii) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. 11. Section 280G . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement (or any plan, policy, agreement or other arrangement covering Executive), if any payment, right or benefit paid, provided or due to Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (each, a Payment, and collectively, the Total Payments ), would subject Executive to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the Excise Tax, but only if (i) the amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced, is greater than or equal to (ii) the amount of such Total Payments without reduction (in each case, determined on an after-tax basis). Any reduction of the Total Payments required by this paragraph will be implemented by determining the Parachute Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then by reducing the Payments in order, beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Ratio. For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio, later Payments will be reduced before earlier Payments. For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio and the same time of payment, each Payment will be reduced proportionately. For purposes of this paragraph, Parachute Ratio means a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment, as calculated for purposes of Section 280G of the Code, and (y) the denominator of which is the economic value of the applicable Payment. 
 12. Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Agreement: 
 (a) Cause with respect to the Company s termination of Executive means (i) conduct by Executive constituting a material act of misconduct in connection with the performance of Executive s duties, including, without limitation, a material misappropriation of funds or property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; (ii) the conviction of Executive of any felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud, or any conduct by Executive that would reasonably be expected to result in material injury or reputational harm to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates; (iii) continued material non-performance by Executive of his duties hereunder (other than by reason of Executive s physical or mental illness, incapacity or disability) which has continued for more than 10 days following written notice of such non-performance from the Board; (iv) a material breach by Executive of the Restrictive Covenant Agreement (defined below), any other agreement with the Company or its affiliates, or of any duty owed to the Company or its affiliates, provided that Executive has first received written notice that Company intends to terminate Executive s employment hereunder for such breach, which breach is not cured (if curable) within 10 days after the delivery of written notice thereof; (v) a material violation by Executive of the Company s written employment policies, including policies prohibiting sexual harassment, which violation is not cured (if curable) within 10 days after the delivery of written notice thereof; (vi) alcohol abuse or use of controlled substances illegal in the relevant state (other than prescription drugs 

taken in accordance with a physician s prescription) that would reasonably be expected to result in material injury or reputational harm to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates; or (vii) failure to cooperate with a bona fide internal investigation or an investigation by regulatory or law enforcement authorities, after being instructed by the Company to cooperate, or the willful destruction or failure to preserve documents or other materials known to be relevant to such investigation or the inducement of others to fail to cooperate or to produce documents or other materials in connection with such investigation. For avoidance of doubt, a termination of Executive s employment due to his Disability will not constitute a termination without Cause. (b) Change in Control shall mean the occurrence of a change in control event with respect to the Company, within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.409A- 3(i)(5)(i). (c) Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Termination as a result of a Disability will not be construed as a termination by the Company without Cause. 
 
 (e) Good Reason means: (i) a material diminution in Executive s title, responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a material diminution in Executive s Base Salary, except for across-the-board salary reductions similarly affecting all or substantially all C-level executives of the Company; (iii) a change of more than 50 miles in the geographic location at which Executive provide services to the Company; or (iv) the material breach of this Agreement by the Company; provided, however, that no such event will constitute Good Reason unless (x) Executive provides the Company with written objection to such event within 60 days after the initial occurrence thereof, (y) such event is not reversed or corrected by the Company within 30 days of its receipt of such written objection, and (z) Executive separates from service within 60 days following the expiration of that cure period. 
 (f) Severance Period means nine (9) months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a cessation of employment due to a termination by the Company without Cause or resignation by Executive for Good Reason that occurs (in either case) within three (3) months prior to a Change in Control or twelve (12) months following a Change in Control, Severance Period shall mean twelve (12) months. 
 
 13. Company Policies . Executive will comply with all policies of the Company in effect from time to time, including (without limitation) policies regarding ethics, personal conduct, stock ownership, securities trading, clawback and hedging and pledging of securities. 
 14. Indemnification . In addition to any rights to indemnification to which Executive shall be eligible and may be entitled under the Company s governing documents, the Company shall obtain and

Restrictive Covenant Agreement . On the same date this Agreement is executed, Executive will execute the Employee Confidentiality, Assignment and Restrictive Covenant Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Restrictive Covenant Agreement ).

 17. Taxes . All compensation payable to Executive are subject to reduction to reflect applicable withholding and payroll taxes and other deductions required by law.

 18. Entire Agreement; Assignment; Amendment . (a) This Agreement, together with the Restrictive Covenants Agreement and other agreements and documents referenced herein, constitute the final and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters covered hereby and replace and supersede all prior agreements, discussions, negotiations, representations or understandings (whether written, oral or implied) relating to Executive s employment by the Company. 
 (b) The rights and obligations of Executive hereunder are personal and may not be assigned. The Company may assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, to any entity to which the Company transfers substantially all of its assets (or an affiliate thereof).

 (c) This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and Executive. 
 19. Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware , without regard to its choice of law provisions.

Neither the Plan nor this Agreement will confer upon Participant any right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or limit in any respect the right of the Company or its Affiliates to discharge Participant at any time, for any reason. 7. The Plan . Participant has received a copy of the Plan, has read the Plan and is familiar with its terms, and hereby accepts the Award subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan.

Entire Agreement . The Grant Notice and this Agreement, together with the Plan, represent the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior agreement, written or otherwise, relating to the subject matter hereof. 10. Amendment .

Governing Law . This Agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the application of the principles of conflicts of laws. 12. Headings . The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only. They form no part of the Agreement and will not affect its interpretation. 13. Tax Withholding . Participant acknowledges that the issuance of Shares hereunder will give rise to taxable income subject to required withholding. In accordance with Section 15 of the Plan, the obligations of the Company hereunder are conditioned on the Participant timely paying, or otherwise making arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the timely satisfaction of, such required withholding. If the Company has not elected to settle such required withholding through the withholding of Shares and other arrangements acceptable to the Company have not been made, the Company may require that Participant sell Shares issuable hereunder to satisfy the required withholding. Accordingly, Participant hereby irrevocably authorizes the Company to (a) sell on Participant s behalf such number of Shares issuable hereunder as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the required withholding, and (b) to remit proceeds equal to the required withholding to the applicable tax authorities (or to retain proceeds equal to the required withholding, to the extent the Company has already deposited such amount with the applicable tax authorities).

Participant acknowledges that he or she will be responsible for all broker s fees and other costs of such sale and that the Company is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price. Participant further agrees to execute such additional documents as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate such transactions. 14. Electronic Delivery of Documents .
