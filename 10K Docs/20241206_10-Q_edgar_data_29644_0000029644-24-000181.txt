 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 The satisfaction of performance obligations and the resulting recognition of revenue typically correspond with billing of the customer. In limited circumstances, the customer may be billed at a time later than when revenue is recognized, resulting in contract assets, which are reported in other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets were million and million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. In other limited circumstances, the customer may make a payment at a time earlier than when revenue is recognized and prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations, resulting in contract liabilities, which are reported in deferred revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities were million and million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. 
 The Company will recognize revenue in future periods related to remaining performance obligations for certain open contracts. Generally, these contracts have terms of one year or less. The amount of revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations in which the original duration of the contract is greater than one year is not significant. None of the Company s contracts contained a significant financing component.

 million and accrued interest and penalties on these unrecognized tax benefits were million. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The statutes of limitation periods for the Company s various tax jurisdictions range from two years to 10 years. 
 The Company believes it is remote that any adjustment necessary to the reserve for income taxes over the next 12 months will be material. However, it is possible the ultimate resolution of audits or disputes may result in a material change to the reserve for income taxes, although the quantification of such potential adjustments cannot be made at this time.

months or less, which is consistent with the forecasts of the related purchases and sales. Certain contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, whereas the remaining contracts, most of which are related to certain intercompany transactions which offset balance sheet exposure, are not designated as hedging instruments. The total notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges was million and million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The total notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was million and million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. 
 Changes in the fair value of the Company s designated hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets until the related transaction occurs, see Note 11. Designated hedges are recognized as a component of either net sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses or other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings upon occurrence of the related hedged transaction. 
 Hedges and subsequent changes in the fair value of hedges that are not designated are recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings along with the related hedged transactions. 
 Amounts related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months based upon the timing of inventory purchases and sales. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreements to hedge its exposure to adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements for i ts operations in Europe. The Company has elected the spot method for designating these contracts as net investment hedges. 
 The total notional amount of net investment hedges as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 was million, or million. The maturity dates range from 2027 to 2029. 
 Gains and losses resulting from a change in fair value of the net investment hedge are offset by gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts related to excluded components associated with the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified into earnings in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings through their maturity. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows from derivative transactions are recorded in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

million compared to the carrying values of million, inclusive of a current portion with a fair value of million and carrying value of million. As of July 31, 2024, the estimated fair values of fixed interest rate long-term debt were million compared to the carrying values of million. The fair values are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the interest rates at which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed. The carrying values of total variable interest rate long-term debt were million and million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively, and approximate their fair values. Long-term debt is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Investment in Joint Ventures and a Non-Controlling Interest 
 The Company holds investments in joint ventures and a non-controlling interest, which are accounted for as equity method investments at fair value and are included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The aggregate carrying amount of these investments was million and million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The increase is primarily driven by the million equity method investment in Medica as of October 31, 2024. These equity method investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of the Company s equity method investments has not been adjusted as there have been no triggering events or changes in circumstance that would have had an adverse impact on the value of these investments. In the event these investments are required to be measured, they would fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value, as the investments are in privately-held entities. 
 Derivative Fair Value Measurements 
 The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and are determined by standard calculations and models that use readily observable market parameters. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates. Industry standard data providers are the primary source for forward and spot rate information for foreign currency exchange rates. The fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For discussion of the Company s derivatives and hedging, see Note 14.

 Amounts related to excluded components, such as forward points, are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of net investment hedges and are expected to be reclassified into earnings throughout their maturity dates. See Note 11 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow method. This fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs in the market and thus, represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreement (e.g., potential payment amounts, length of measurement periods, manner of calculating any amounts due) and utilizes assumptions with regard to future financial and operational milestones, probabilities of achieving such milestones and a discount rate. Depending on the contractual terms of the purchase agreement, the probability of achieving such milestones generally represents the only significant unobservable input. The contingent consideration liability is measured at fair value each reporting period and changes in estimates of fair value are recognized in earnings. 
 The fair value of the Company s contingent consideration liability that uses unobservable inputs was million as of October 31, 2024 and million as of July 31, 2024. The maximum potential payout of the contingent consideration was million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, see Note 17.

Net Sales 
 
 (1) The impact of foreign currency translation was calculated by translating the first quarter of fiscal 2025 foreign currency net sales into U.S. dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. The impact of currency translation does not change the underlying drivers of revenue shown in this chart.

 Net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 increased 53.8 million, or 6.4 , from the three months ended October 31, 2023, reflecting higher sales in the Mobile Solutions segment of 32.4 million, or 6.0 growth, the Industrial Solutions segment of 11.4 million, or 4.6 growth, and the Life Sciences segment of 10.0 million, or 16.6 growth. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by 7.1 million compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, reflecting increases in the Mobile Solutions, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences segments of 3.3 million, 2.2 million and 1.6 million, respectively. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company s net sales increase was driven primarily by volume increases primarily due to strong underlying market growth. 
 Gross Margin 
 Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 35.5 , a decrease from 35.6 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to restructuring expenses of 1.1 million associated with a continuation of the global footprint and cost optimization actions. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were 166.1 million, or 18.5 of net sales, compared with 155.0 million, or 18.3 of net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of 11.1 million, or 7.2 . The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to restructuring expenses of 2.2 million associated with a continuation of the global footprint and cost optimization actions. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were 22.7 million, or 2.5 of net sales, were generally flat as a percentage of net sales compared with 21.3 million, or 2.5 of net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2023.

Non-Operating Items 
 Interest expense was 5.5 million for both the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 Other income, net for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 5.2 million, compared with other income, net of 3.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of 1.4 million, which was driven primarily by higher income from joint ventures. 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate was 24.2 and 25.1 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD released the Model GloBE Rules for Pillar Two on December 20, 2021, which defined a 15 global minimum tax. Since the model rules have been released, many countries have enacted or continue to consider changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two proposals, some of which became effective for tax years beginning after January 1, 2024. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. The Company does not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements as most jurisdictions in which the Company operates have an effective tax above the 15 threshold. 
 Net Earnings 
 Net earnings for the three months ended October 31, 2024 were 99.0 million, compared with 92.1 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of 6.9 million, or 7.5 . Diluted EPS were 0.81 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared with 0.75 for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of 0.06, or 8.1 .

 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is assessed in terms of the Company s ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available credit facilities and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from the operation of its businesses as its primary source of liquidity, with sufficient liquidity available to fund growth through reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 Cash flows were as follows (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 72.9 138.0 (65.1) Investing activities (96.0) (23.2) (72.8) Financing activities 9.8 (78.9) 88.7 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1.8 (5.2) 7.0 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (11.5) 30.7 (42.2) 
 26 

Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 72.9 million, compared with 138.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, a decrease of 65.1 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in working capital requirements during the current quarter, including purchasing additional inventory to increase on-time deliveries, partially offset by higher earnings in the current quarter. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 96.0 million, compared with 23.2 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of 72.8 million. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the equity method investment in Medica. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for payment of dividends and repurchases of the Company s common stock, net of borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 9.8 million, compared with cash used in financing activities of 78.9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of 88.7 million. The increase was primarily driven by a debt repayment of 73.8 in the first quarter of the prior year. 
 To determine the level of dividend and share repurchases, the Company considers recent and projected performance across key financial metrics, including earnings, cash flow from operations and total debt. Dividends paid for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 were 32.4 million and 30.2 million, respectively. Share repurchases for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 were 74.4 million and 53.3 million, respectively. 
 Capital Resources 
 Additional sources of liquidity are existing cash and available credit facilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024 was 221.2 million, compared with 232.7 million as of July 31, 2024. The Company has capacity of 501.9 million available for further borrowing under existing credit facilities as of October 31, 2024, which includes 327.0 million available on the Company s 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on May 21, 2026. 
 The Company believes the liquidity available from the combination of expected cash generated by operating activities, existing cash and available credit under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, payment of dividends, share repurchase activity and potential acquisitions. 
 Financial Condition 
 Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt 
 As of October 31, 2024, total debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt, represented 29.4 of total capitalization, defined as total debt plus total stockholders equity, compared with 26.5 as of July 31, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants. 
 Long-term debt outstanding was 563.6 million as of October 31, 2024, compared with 508.4 million as of July 31, 2024, an increase of 55.2 million, primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt received during the three months ended October 31, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, there was 327.0 million available and 165.0 million outstanding on the Company s 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on May 21, 2026. 
 Working Capital 
 In order to help measure and analyze the impact of working capital management, the Company calculates days sales outstanding as the average accounts receivable, net for the quarter, divided by net sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter. The Company calculates days inventory outstanding as the average inventories, net for the quarter, divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter. The Company calculates days payable outstanding as the average accounts payable for the quarter, divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by the number of days in the quarter. The Company calculates net cash cycle as the sum of days sales outstanding and days inventory outstanding, less days payables outstanding.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage these risks, the Company employs certain strategies to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations. The Company does not enter into any of these strategies for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The Company maintains significant assets and operations outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to foreign currency gains and losses. A portion of the Company s foreign currency exposure is naturally hedged by incurring liabilities, including bank debt, denominated in the local currency in which the Company s foreign subsidiaries are located. 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker than in the three months ended October 31, 2023 compared with many of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company operates. The overall weaker U.S. dollar had a positive impact on the Company s international net sales and net earnings because the foreign denominated revenues translated into more U.S. dollars in many regions around the world. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation for the three months ended October 31, 2024 resulted in an overall increase in reported net sales of 7.1 million and an increase in reported net earnings of 0.9 million. 
 Derivative Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company enters into derivative instrument agreements, including foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges, to manage risk in connection with changes in foreign currency. The Company only enters into derivative instrument agreements with counterparties who have highly rated credit. See Notes 11, 14 and 15 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report. 
 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - Cash Flow Hedges and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 The Company buys materials from foreign suppliers. Those transactions can be denominated in those suppliers local currency. The Company also sells to customers in foreign countries. Those transactions can be denominated in those customers local currency. Both of these transaction types can create volatility in the Company s financial statements. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage those exposures and fluctuations. These contracts generally mature in 12 months or less, which is consistent with the forecasts of the related purchases and sales. Certain contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, whereas the remaining contracts, most of which are related to certain intercompany transactions which offset balance sheet exposure, are not designated as hedging instruments. The total notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges was 66.9 million and 32.3 million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. The total notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was 190.1 million and 249.7 million as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreements to hedge its exposure to adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements for i ts operations in Europe. The Company has elected the spot method for designating these contracts as net investment hedges. 
 The total notional amount of net investment hedges as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024 was 80 million, or 88.8 million. The maturity dates range from 2027 to 2029. 
 Based on the net investment hedges outstanding as of October 31, 2024, a 10 appreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro would result in a net gain of 8.0 million in the fair value of these contracts. 
 Interest Rates 
 The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to debt obligations that are at variable rates, as well as the potential increase in the fair value of long-term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates. As of October 31, 2024, the Company s financial liabilities with exposure to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of 165.0 million outstanding on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility, 80.0 million, or 86.9 million, of a variable rate term loan and 2.0 billion, or 13.1 million, of variable rate senior notes. As of October 31, 2024, variable short-term borrowings outstanding consisted of 70.8 million. Assuming a hypothetical 0.5 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates, with all other variables remaining constant, interest expense would have increased approximately 0.4 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024. The Company has no interest rate hedging agreements. Interest rate changes would also affect the fair market value of fixed-rate debt. As of October 31, 2024, the estimated fair values of fixed interest rate long-term debt were 266.8 million compared to the carrying values of 300.0 million. The fair values are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the interest rates at which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed. 
 The interest on cash and cash equivalents will vary as short-term yields change. Assuming a hypothetical 0.5 percentage point increase in yields, with all other variables remaining constant, interest income would have increased approximately 0.3 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024. 
 29 

Commodity Prices 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuating prices of purchased commodity raw materials, including steel, filter media and petrochemical-based products including plastics, rubber and adhesives. On an ongoing basis, the Company enters into selective supply arrangements that allow the Company to reduce volatility in its costs. The Company strives to recover or offset all material cost increases through price increases to its customers and the Company s cost reduction initiatives, which include material substitution, process improvement and product redesigns. However, an increase in commodity prices could result in lower gross profit. 
 Bankers Acceptance Notes 
 Consistent with common business practice in APAC, the Company has subsidiaries which accept bankers acceptance notes from their customers in settlement of certain customer billed accounts receivable. Bankers acceptance notes represent a commitment by the issuing financial institution to pay a certain amount of money at a specified future maturity date to the legal owner of the bankers acceptance note as of the maturity date. The maturity dates of bankers acceptance notes vary, but it is the Company s policy to only accept bankers acceptance notes with maturity dates no more than 180 days from the date of the Company s receipt of such draft. As of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, the Company owned 6.7 million and 8.4 million, respectively, of these bankers acceptance notes and includes them in accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed so information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company records provisions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and litigation are reviewed quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the status of a particular matter. The Company believes the estimated liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for claims or litigation is adequate and appropriate for the probable and estimable outcomes. Liabilities recorded were not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company believes it is remote that the settlement of any of the currently identified claims or litigation will be materially in excess of what is accrued. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Company s global operations that involve the manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect the Company s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The Risk Factors section in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 outlines the risks and uncertainties the Company believes are the most material to its business.
