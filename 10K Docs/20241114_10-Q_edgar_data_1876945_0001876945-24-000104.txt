and and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 a net loss attributable to the Company of and , and net cash used in operating activities of and , respectively. Because of these factors, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As described in Note 1, the Company consummated a reverse merger with TPCO on July 7, 2023, forming GFC. The Company plans to reduce operating expenses through various strategic initiatives and aggressive cost-cutting measures which the Company believes will allow it to operate for at least the next twelve months. In addition, the Company plans to raise additional financing if needed to help fund operations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving its objectives. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 
 The Company is an Emerging Growth Company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and it has taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.

 All real estate leases are recorded on the balance sheet. Equipment and other non-real estate leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Gold Flora entered into a Loan Agreement with J.J. Astor Co. (the "Investor"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investor, in exchange for the payment by the Investor of million, a senior secured promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of million (the Initial Note ). The Loan Agreement also provides for the future issuance of up to additional notes (the Additional Notes and together with the Initial Note, subject to certain conditions and on substantially the same terms as the initial closing. Each subsequent closing would result in the issuance of an Additional Note with an original principal amount of million and a funded amount of million. 
 
 The Initial Note is secured by a pledge of the Company s stock and other equity interests in certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to a pledge agreement between the Company and the Investor, which will constitute a lien and security interest if the Investor accelerates the amount due under the Initial Note or any Additional Note during an event of default. The Initial Note may be prepaid, and the principal amount will be reduced to approximately million if prepaid within 30 days of issuance, to approximately million if prepaid between 30 and 60 days after issuance, and to approximately million if prepaid between 60 and 90 days after issuance. 
 
 The Initial Note imposes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon the Company, as well as covenants that (i) restrict the Company and its subsidiaries from incurring any additional indebtedness or suffering any liens, subject to specified exceptions, (ii) restrict the issuance or repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock, subject to specified exceptions, and (iii) restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions, subject to specified exceptions. If an event of default under the Initial Note or any Additional Note occurs, the principal amount will be multiplied by and interest will begin accruing at a default rate of per annum from the date of a default. Upon an event of default and following any applicable cure periods, the Investor may elect to accelerate the Initial Note or any Additional Note and thereafter convert all or a portion of the outstanding notes into shares of the Company s common stock. The conversion price for any such conversion will be equal to of the average of the lowest volume weighted average closing prices of the Company s common stock on the Cboe Canada exchange during the trading days prior to the conversion, subject to adjustment in the event of any issuance of securities at a lower purchase, exercise or conversion price, and subject to applicable limitations of the Cboe Canada exchange.

13.) ) Income Taxes ) ) ) ) Effective Tax Rate 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company calculated its provision by applying the discrete method due to the inability to rely on forecasts. The Company believes the discrete method to calculate the interim tax provision is more appropriate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense increased as compared to the same periods in the prior year resulting from the Business Combination that occurred on July 7, 2023. 
 Due to its cannabis operations, the Company is subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 280E. Under IRC Section 280E, the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of its cannabis products. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-deductible under IRC Section 280E for the Company's expenses related to its plant-touching cannabis operations. 
 The effective tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2024, varies from the period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to addition of penalties and interest and the change in nondeductible expenses under IRC Section 280E as a proportion of pre-tax loss during the period and true up to the beginning net deferred tax liability. The Company incurs expenses that are not deductible due to IRC Section 280E limitations which results in significant permanent book-to-tax differences that may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss. 
 The Company files income tax returns in the US and various state jurisdictions and is subject to examination of its income tax returns by tax authorities in these jurisdictions who may challenge any representations made on these returns. The statute of limitations for these jurisdictions may remain open for as far back as tax year 2019 to the present. 
 The Company recognizes the financial statement impact of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more-likely-than-not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest impact that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company s federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by income taxing authorities, generally for three years after the returns are filed. 
 
 The Company operates in a number of domestic tax jurisdictions and is subject to examination of its income tax returns by tax authorities in these jurisdictions who may challenge any item of those returns. Because tax matters that may be challenged by tax authorities are typically complex, the ultimate outcome of these challenges is uncertain. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. 
 
 The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjusts the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. The measurement of the uncertain tax position is based on the largest benefit amount to be realized upon settlement of the matter. If payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax expense may result. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an uncertain tax liability for uncertain tax positions primarily related to the treatment of certain transactions and deductions under IRC Section 280E based on legal interpretations that challenge the Company s tax liability under IRC Section 280E. During Q3 of 2024, the Company filed amended tax returns for periods ending 2020 through 2022 to reflect this position. In Q4 of 2024, the Company filed its 2023 tax returns to reflect this position.

The amount was recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. Certain of the dissenting TPCO shareholders have asserted that the fair value of their TPCO Shares was higher than the trading price of June 14, 2023 and should have been determined to be at least US per TPCO Share. On September 8, 2023, those certain former TPCO shareholders filed a petition in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to be paid their asserted value per TPCO Share. However, the ultimate amount required to be paid by Gold Flora is subject to determination by the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities legislation, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as future, anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, plan, will, would, could, can, may, and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K") under the heading Risk Factors. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. 
 
 Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on our fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to our fiscal years ended on the last day in December and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Introduction 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be read together with other information, including our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Interim Financial Statements ). The Interim Financial Statements referenced in this MD A are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and presented in United States dollars or US and expressed in thousands, unless otherwise indicated. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this MD A have the meanings given to them in the Interim Financial Statements. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. 
 The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non- emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and (4) the date on which we have, during the previous three year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible notes payable. 
 
 Gold Flora Corporation is a holding company domesticated in the State of Delaware by way of corporate continuance from British Columbia, Canada on July 7, 2023.

 Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Development and Expansion of Gramlin Product Brand 
 We developed a new, disruptive product brand, Gramlin, designed to appeal to high-volume consumers that frequently purchase flower, vape and pre-roll products. Gramlin was successfully launched in March 2024 through our first party retail outlets and Stately Distribution across California. Gramlin features proprietary genetic strains grown at Gold Flora s recently expanded cultivation capacity and is strategically priced to offer an unmatchable quality to price ratio, leveraging the competitive advantages provided by our vertical footprint. 
 
 Gramlin products are now available across our 16 retail stores, through our commerce digital sites as well as more than 353 third-party retailers across the state through Stately Distribution. Since its initial launch in March 2024, Gramlin has become the second fastest growing brand in California. Gramlin is currently sold in 100 of the top 20 cannabis chain accounts in California. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we added an all in one live rosin vape to the Gramlin line and are now selling to over 150 customer accounts within the first 60 days of launch. 
 
 Restructuring Activities 
 We have diligently and successfully accomplished targeted measures to streamline and integrate legacy operations into our vertically-integrated platform. In addition, we have nearly eliminated reliance on third-party vendors for biomass, manufacturing, and distribution. 
 Company-Owned Branded Product Growth 
 Having completed the Business Combination and also much of the cost and retail rationalization, we now benefit from a retail presence that contributes to knowledgeable expansion of company-owned branded product that now includes Aviation Cannabis, Cruisers, Current, Gold Flora, Gramlin, Jetfuel Cannabis, Mirayo by Santana, Monogram and Roll Bleezy. The availability of owned down-stream retail outlets has been instrumental in developing and launching new owned brands such as Gramlin. This enables us to be "quick to market" and nimble in responding to market trends. 
 
 29 

Cultivation 
 Our cultivation capacity is now maximized at the DHS Campus and San Jose campus. Annual flower production is around 40,000 pounds when all flower rooms are operating optimally. 
 
 A majority of this flower will be utilized to produce our first party branded packaged products for sale in our retail stores and to third party stores through distribution. This represents a significant increase in capacity dedicated to fulfilling first party product demand internally improving consolidated margins and lowering risk. Excess flower outside of our Consumer Packaged Goods ("CPG") sales channels is being sold through our bulk flower sales team. 
 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, Gold Flora has continued to improve its production performance, with a 20 production increase since the first quarter of 2024, reflecting higher yields and scheduling efficiencies. 
 
 Manufacturing 
 We have centralized our manufacturing at the DHS Campus and over 200 SKUs move through the operation on a monthly basis. Over the past quarter, Gold Flora Manufacturing has focused on two key productivity and margin-drivers that reinforce our vision of vertical integration and scale in the California market: 
 
 Operational efficiencies through automation 
 
 New product commercialization of Gramlin All-in-One Vapes, Infused Pre-Rolls, and Live Rosin Products 
 
 Gold Flora has significantly improved operational efficiencies through the maximization of its flower bagging and jarring automated lines. The results of these efforts have enabled production to increase 70 since last quarter. 
 
 Distribution Sales 
 We have strategically increased the number of third party dispensary accounts buying from Stately Distribution contributing to better overall product management and successful brand launches. The expansion was accomplished by the hiring of more experienced sales professionals, a net 50 increase to the total number of sales representatives in the field and an increase in product availability and selection due to the efficiencies achieved following the Business Combination. This has led to our enhanced market position which resulted in an increased demand of our products. 
 Retail Sales 
 With the addition of retail locations from the Business Combination, we have expanded our retail footprint and enhanced our market position for Gold Flora owned branded products increasing its first party product revenue generated at its owned retail stores to 34 of total retail store sales in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 The increase in wholesale revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to increased sales to third party dispensaries driven by the launch of the Gramlin brand during the second quarter of 2024. Gramlin is currently ranked 11th in overall retail sales in California according to Headset. 
 The decrease in retail revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to the closure of various non-profitable retail and delivery services during the third quarter of 2023. 
 The increase in retail revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the July 2023 Business Combination which added 11 additional retail locations rather than same store sales growth. As of September 30, 2024, we operated 16 retail locations.

 Gross Profit reflects our revenue less our cost of sales, which consist of costs primarily consisting of labor, materials, consumable supplies, overhead, amortization of production equipment, shipping, packaging and other expenses. 
 The significant improvement in adjusted gross profit for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to larger scale operations following the Business Combination along with vertical integration efficiencies, bringing distribution in-house, and reduction of third party costs through supply chain optimization. Since the Business Combination, retail has focused on centralizing resources to increase proficiencies in operations and in store profitability and closing non-profitable delivery services. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. As a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

 Debt and Convertible Debt Interest Expense, Net 
 The reduction in interest expense for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a function of the extinguishment of notes payable and the conversion of debt in July 2023 offset in part by higher rates on the modified convertible debt amended in July 2023 along with the additional interest expense associated with the new promissory note that was entered into during August 2024. 
 Finance Lease Liability Interest Expense, Net 
 The increase in finance lease interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the addition of new capital lease during 2024. 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 The increase in other (income) expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to California Department of Tax and Fee Administration "CDTFA" related penalties and fines that were incurred during the second and third quarter of 2024. 
 
 MANAGEMENT S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 This MD A contains certain financial performance measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, that are not recognized under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, see the tables below for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and the gross profit discussion section of the "Results of Operations" comparison of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of this MD A. 
 EBITDA 
 We believe EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of our Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income taxes and (iii) interest expense and debt amortization. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of our Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude extraordinary items, non-recurring items and, other non-cash items, including, but not limited to (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) change in fair value of the earn out liability, (iii) non-recurring legal and professional fees, human-resources, inventory and collections-related expenses, (iv) intangible and goodwill

impairments and loss on disposal of assets, (v) transaction costs related to Business Combination and other acquisition activities, (vi) retail and cultivation pre-opening costs and, (vii) non-recurring inventory adjustments .

 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 The decrease in EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to a one time gain on bargain purchase price associated with the July 2023 merger. 
 The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly due to efficiencies achieved from the Company's vertical integration efforts since the July 2023 merger. 
 The decrease in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly due to the costs incurred following the Business Combination associated with improvement to overall operations as we implement efficiencies and focus on growing revenue streams. To some extent, the cultivation expansion has a non-recurring negative impact on earnings because each new flowering room has to undertake an eight-week grow cycle requiring labor and nutrients before the first harvest. An additional drying, curing and trimming is required prior to the first sale. These expenses stabilize once a normal weekly harvest cycle commences and will be spread across a broader inventory or COGS base.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We are currently meeting our obligations as they become due from our current working capital and operations. Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been operations, capital contributions made by equity investors, debt issuances and most recently 55,629 of cash acquired as part of the Business Combination in July 2023. We b elieve that Gold Flora's efficient vertical-integration and increased scale will lead to longer-term profitability and sustainable cash flow. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 10,166 compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately 22,538 as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for cost reductions and business optimizations to reduce cash use, accelerate profitable market share growth, improve gross margin profile and work toward generating sustained free cash flow over the longer term. We plan to raise additional capital as needed which if not available would raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 If additional capital is required, we have access to public capital markets through our listing on the Cboe Canada exchange, and will continue to review and pursue selected external financing sources to ensure adequate financial resources. These potential sources include, but are not limited to (i) traditional or non-traditional investment capital organizations; (ii) sale of common stock or other equity or debt instruments; and (iii) debt financing with lending terms that more closely match our business model and capital needs. There can be no assurance that we will gain adequate market acceptance for our products or be able to generate sufficient positive cash flow to achieve its business plans, that additional capital or other types of financing will be available when needed, or that these financings will be on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, due to the price of our common stock, raising equity capital currently may not be feasible. Any additional equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive, or potentially dilutive, to our shareholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to our ability to pay dividends, raise additional capital or execute various other financial and operational plans. 
 
 We do not have any requirements for capital expenditures. See " Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies " above. 
 
 CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 
 Presented below is a summary of Gold Flora Corporation s cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (5,786) (24,821) Net cash (provided by) used in investing activities (2,050) 54,552 Net cash used in financing activities (4,536) (2,651) 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in cash used in operating activities was due to the increased costs associated with operations of the larger amalgamated company following the Business Combination on July 7, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment and leasehold improvements for sustaining our operations. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the debt repayment, while in the same period in the comparative quarter, we were a net issuer of debt. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 Lease Obligations, Notes Payable and Convertible Notes Payable 
 We have material lease obligations payable which are detailed in Note 8 of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. We have material notes and convertible notes payable which are detailed in Notes 9 and 10 of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 California operating licenses 
 Our primary activity is engaging in state-legal commercial cannabis business, including the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of cannabis and cannabis products pursuant to California law. However, this activity is not in compliance with the United States Controlled Substances Act, or the CSA. Our assets are potentially subject to seizure or confiscation by Federal governmental agencies, and we could face criminal and civil penalties for noncompliance with the CSA, although such events would be without relevant precedent. Our management believes that we are in compliance with all California and local jurisdiction laws and monitors the regulatory environment on an ongoing basis along with counsel to ensure the continued compliance with all applicable laws and licensing agreements. 
 Our operation is sanctioned by the State of California and local jurisdictions. There have been no instances of federal interference with those who adhere to State of California and local laws and regulations regarding commercial cannabis activities. Due to the uncertainty surrounding our noncompliance with the CSA, the potential liability from any noncompliance cannot be reasonably estimated and we may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties or restrictions in the future. 
 Effective January 1, 2018, the State of California (the "State") allowed for adult use cannabis sales. Beginning on January 1, 2018, the State began issuing temporary licenses that expired 120 days after issuance for retail, distribution, manufacturing and cultivation permits. Temporary licenses could be extended in 90-day increments by the State upon submission of an annual license application. All temporary licenses had been granted extensions by the State during 2018. 
 In September 2019, Senate Bill 1459 (SB 1459) was enacted which enabled state licensing authorities to issue provisional licenses through 2021. A provisional license could be issued if an applicant submitted a completed annual license application to the Bureau of Cannabis Control. A completed application for purposes of obtaining a provisional license is not the same as a sufficient application to obtain an annual license. The provisional cannabis license, which is valid for 12 months from the date issued, is said to be in between a temporary license and an annual license and allows a cannabis business to operate as they would under local and state regulations. 
 Licensees issued a provisional license are expected to be diligently working toward completing all annual license requirements in order to maintain a provisional license. We obtained our provisional licenses in 2019 and continue to work with the State of California to obtain annual licensing. 
 Our prior licenses obtained from the local jurisdictions we operated in have been continued by such jurisdictions and are necessary to obtain State licensing. 
 We have received annual licenses from each local jurisdiction in which we actively operate. Although we believe we will continue to receive the necessary licenses from the State and applicable local jurisdictions to conduct our business in a timely fashion, there is no guarantee our clients will be able to do so and any failure of our clients to receive necessary licenses may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 Our operations are subject to a variety of local and state regulations. Failure to comply with one or more of those regulations could result in fines, restrictions on its operations, or losses of permits that could result in us ceasing operations in that specific state or local jurisdiction. While our management believes that we are in compliance with applicable local and state regulations, cannabis regulations continue to evolve and are subject to differing interpretations. As a result, we may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, or restrictions in the future. 
 
 We have a loyalty program whereby customers accumulate points through purchases, and the earned points can be used to reduce the price of future purchases. The points do not expire and are recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets for amounts customers have earned but have not yet used. 
 
 In connection with the Business Combination in July 2023, certain TPCO shareholders dissented from the vote and were therefore entitled to the fair value of their common shares of TPCO ("TPCO Shares"). The fair value amount paid by the Company was calculated based on the closing share price of the TPCO Shares of 0.17696 on June 14, 2023 (being the last trading date prior to the date of the meeting of the shareholders of TPCO to approve the Business Combination. The amount was recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. Certain of the dissenting TPCO shareholders have asserted that the fair value of their TPCO Shares was higher than the trading price of June 14, 2023 and should have been determined to be at least US 0.9847 per TPCO Share. On September 8, 2023, those certain former TPCO shareholders filed a petition in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to be paid their asserted value per TPCO Share. However, the ultimate amount required to be paid by Gold Flora is subject to determination by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The determination hearing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a final judgement expected to be issued in due course thereafter.

Claims and Litigation 
 
 On or about August 30, 2020, Gold Flora parties filed an action against Shelf Life, Inc. et al SLI in Orange County Superior Court in California, which actions was later submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to stipulation by the parties. In the action, Gold Flora disputed the amount of closing consideration owed to SLI following the acquisition of certain of its assets based on omission of relevant information, and SLI brought a cross-claim against Gold Flora seeking full payment of the 5.2 million note balance owed. The arbitrator in the matter issued an interim judgement awarding SLI 5.2 million, in addition to certain potential costs and interest. The arbitration was resolved on August 23, 2024 for a final judgment of 6.1 million. 
 
 On or about October 28, 2022, Jeff and Shanna Droege filed a Notice of Arbitration alleging breach of contract and other business torts against Left Coast Ventures ("LCV") and three former LCV directors in front of JAMS Resolution Center in San Francisco. Subsequently, the claims against the indemnified LCV directors were moved to a separate action filed in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara, which claims against two of the directors have now been dismissed with prejudice. Monetary relief is sought in each outstanding action. The arbitration decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 On or about March 30, 2021, former directors and shareholders of LCV filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against multiple defendant parties, including three former directors of LCV alleging breach of duties to the company and shareholders and other business torts and requesting monetary damages. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint, adding new parties, including TPCO and a former TPCO director. We and LCV have certain indemnification obligations in connection with the defendant directors, which indemnification may be contested by LCV upon resolution of the action. We and LCV are subject to advancement actions brought with fees owed or claimed to be owed to counsel for the indemnified defendants as further described below. 
 Limited Receivership 
 On October 4, 2024, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court granted an order advancing a motion for sanctions brought by the former directors (the Order in Michael Auerbach v. Gold Flora Corporation (C.A. No. 2024-0225-MTZ) and D aniel Fireman, Christopher Akelman, Octavio Boccalandra v. Left Coast Ventures, Inc. (C.A. No. 2023-0588-MTZ). The Order held us and LCV in contempt for violation of advancement orders with respect to indemnification obligations for fees owed to counsel and related expenses, which amount is currently estimated at approximately 1.65 million. 
 Pursuant to the Order, the Court appointed Molly DiBianca of Clark Hill PLC (the Limited Receiver as a limited purpose receiver to take such action that the Limited Receiver determines in good faith is appropriate to cause us and LCV to satisfy the amounts due under the Order, including accessing financial records and negotiation of a payment plan with the former directors (the Charge pursuant to Title 8, Section 322 of the Delaware General Corporation Law Section 322 ). The Order did not create a full, general receivership over us, and the Limited Receiver s appointment is limited to the foregoing Charge. The Order provides that the Limited Receiver should first attempt to resort to resolving the Charge through operating cash flow. The Limited Receiver has all powers generally available to a receiver under Section 322 solely with respect to the Charge, and the Limited Receiver will not have authority over us except in connection with the Charge. The initial term for the Limited Receiver was 59 days from the date of the Order. Additionally, we and LCV would incur a daily fine of 1,000 until the contempt is cured, provided that the fine would not become due and payable if the Charge is satisfied or a payment plan is in place by October 31, 2024. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Court issued a stipulation and order (the Stipulation and the Limited Receiver filed an interim report (the Report ). The Stipulation requires us to pay an aggregate of 150,000 per month to the satisfy amounts due under the Order. Pursuant to the Report, the Limited Receiver stayed the limited receivership, conditioned upon our compliance with the payment plan and satisfaction of any future advancement demands brought by the former directors. 
 Inflation 
 We are not immune to the widespread cost inflation experienced in the United States and many parts of the world. We intend to continue to work to improve our gross margins despite cost inflation through market pricing, greater cost efficiencies, advantageous vendor partnerships, and other measures. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 As of the date hereof, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non-financial assets.

SHARE CAPITAL AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 287,644,766 shares of common stock, 69,701,256 common stock purchase warrants and 13,753,065 stock options issued and outstanding. 35,837,500 warrants were assumed as part of the Business Combination in July 2023 and are exercisable at an exercise price of 6.47. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, 33,863,756 warrants that were previously issued and outstanding as Gold Flora, LLC warrants and that were exchanged in the Business Combination for warrants of the Company have a weighted average exercise price of 1.05 . As at September 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining term of all the warrants was 1.20 years. 
 No stock options were granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 13,657,500 stock options remain outstanding as of September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024, a total of 104,757 restricted stock units were outstanding under the former equity incentive plan of TPCO which was assumed in the July 2023 Business Combination. 
 We manage our capital with the following objectives: 
 To ensure sufficient financial flexibility to achieve the ongoing business objectives including of future growth opportunities, and pursuit of accretive acquisitions; and 
 To maximize shareholder return through enhancing the share value. 
 We consider our capital to be total equity. We manage capital through our financial and operational forecasting processes. We review our working capital and forecasts our future cash flows based on operating expenditures, and other investing and financing activities. Our capital management objectives, policies and processes have remained unchanged during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. We are not subject to any external capital requirements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on management s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that management considers to be reasonable. 
 
 Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
 
 Consolidation 
 Judgment is applied in assessing whether the Company exercises control and has significant influence over entities in which the Company directly or indirectly owns an interest. The Company has control when it has the power over the subsidiary, has exposure or rights to variable returns, and has the ability to use its power to affect the returns. Significant influence is defined as the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the subsidiaries. Where the Company is determined to have control, these entities are consolidated. Additionally, judgment is applied in determining the effective date on which control was obtained. 
 
 Business combinations 
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. When the Company acquires control of a business, any previously held equity interest also is remeasured to fair value. The excess of the purchase consideration and any previously held equity interest over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is goodwill. If the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration and any previously held equity interest, the difference is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations immediately as a gain or loss on acquisition. 
 
 Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. 
 Leases 
 
 The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASC 842 ). In addition, the Company elected accounting policy elections to exclude from the consolidated balances the right-of-use ROU assets and lease liabilities related to short-term leases, which are those leases with a lease term of twelve months or less that do not include an option purchase the underlying lease asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise and to not separate leases and non-lease components. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and accrued obligations under operating lease (current and non-current) liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net and finance lease obligations are included under finance lease (current and non- 
 33 

current) liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
 ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are classified as a finance lease or an operating lease. A finance lease is a lease in which 1) ownership of the property transfers to the lessee by the end of the lease term; 2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise; 3) the lease is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset; or 4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already included in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value; or 5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. The Company classifies a lease as an operating lease when it does not meet any one of these criteria. 
 
 The Company applies judgment in determining whether a contract contains a lease and if a lease is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company applies judgement in determining the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, which may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Gold Flora will exercise that option. All relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination are considered. The Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. It considers whether the Company can benefit from the ROU asset either on its own or together with other resources and whether the asset is highly dependent on or highly interrelated with another ROU asset. 
 
 Convertible Notes Payable 
 
 The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815 ). ASC 815 generally provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the embedded features meet the criteria of contracts in an entity s own equity in ASC 815-40. Gold Flora s convertible notes payable met the exception described above. 
 
 The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance ASC 470, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features , as those professional standards pertain to Certain Convertible Instruments . Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. ASC 815 provides that generally, if an event that is not within the entity s control could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may have been impaired. In order to determine that the value of goodwill may have been impaired, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, indicating the potential for goodwill impairment. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Changes in the conditions for these judgments and estimates can significantly affect the assessed value of goodwill. 
 
 Long-lived assets 
 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and finite-lived intangible assets are dependent upon estimates of useful lives, which are determined through the exercise of judgment. The assessment of any impairment of these assets is dependent upon estimates of recoverable amounts that consider factors such as economic and market conditions and the useful lives of assets. We use judgment in: (i) assessing whether there are impairment triggers affecting long-lived assets, (ii) determining the asset groups and(iii) determining the recoverable amount and if necessary, estimating the fair value. 
 
 34 

Fair value measurement 
 
 We use valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments (where active market quotes are not available) and non-financial assets. This involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument. We base our assumptions on observable data as far as possible, but this is not always available. In that case, we use the best information available. Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an arm s length transaction at the reporting date. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Revenue is recognized by Gold Flora in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Through application of the standard, Gold Flora recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Gold Flora expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
 
 In order to recognize revenue under ASU 2014-09, Gold Flora applies the following five (5) steps: 
 
 Identify a customer along with a corresponding contract; 
 Identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract to transfer goods or provide distinct services to a customer; 
 Determine the transaction price Gold Flora expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer; 
 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and 
 Recognize revenue when or as Gold Flora satisfies the performance obligation(s). 
 
 Revenues consist of wholesale and retail operations of cannabis, which are generally recognized at a point in time when control over the goods have been transferred to the customer and is recorded net of sales discounts. Payment is typically due upon transferring the goods to the customer or within a specified time period permitted under Gold Flora s credit policy. 
 
 Revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Gold Flora satisfies its performance obligation and transfers control upon delivery and acceptance by the customer. 
 
 The Company has a customer loyalty program whereby customers are awarded points with in store and online delivery purchases. Once a customer achieves a certain point level, points can be used to pay for the purchase of product, up to a maximum number of points per transaction. Points expire after six months of no activity in a customer s account. 
 
 Unredeemed awards are recorded as deferred revenue. At the time customers redeem points, the redemption is recorded as an increase to revenue. Deferred revenue is included in other accrued expenses within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company s return policy conforms to the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MAUCRSA ), which was signed into law in September 2017 and creates the general framework for the regulation of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis in California. 
 
 Recent and Anticipated Changes to Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 None. 
 
 United States Regulatory Environment 
 
 On February 8, 2018, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised their previously released Staff Notice 51-352 (Revised) (Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities) Staff Notice 51-352 ), which provides specific disclosure expectations for Canadian issuers that currently have, or are in the process of developing, cannabis-related activities in the United States as permitted within a particular state s regulatory framework. All issuers with U.S. cannabis-related activities are expected to clearly and prominently disclose certain prescribed information in prospectus filings and other required disclosure documents. As a result of our existing operations in California, we are required to provide disclosure pursuant to Staff Notice 51-352. 
 
 The required disclosure pursuant to Staff Notice 51-352 is incorporated by reference from United States Regulatory Environment under Item 1. Business and Risk Factors under Item 1A. Risk Factors from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC and with the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities under its profile on SEDAR+. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Not applicable.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 Based on an evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective to provide reasonable assurance because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weakness 
 As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified control deficiencies in the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. 
 We did not design or maintain an effective control environment commensurate with financial reporting requirements. Specifically, we lacked a sufficient number of adequately skilled professionals to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately while maintaining appropriate segregation of duties. 
 The material weakness described above did not result in a material misstatement of the previously issued financial statements; however, it could result in a misstatement of our account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Remediation Activities 
 We continue to work to fully remediate the material weakness and are taking steps to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are taking appropriate and reasonable steps to remediate this material weakness through the implementation of appropriate segregation of duties, formalization of accounting policies and controls (including evidence of review and timeliness of completion) and retention of appropriate expertise for complex accounting transactions. 
 Management expects to continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal control environment, as well as policies and procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than set forth above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.
