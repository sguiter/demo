 Residual Value Estimate Changes 
 
 We periodically review and adjust, as appropriate, the estimated residual values and useful lives of existing revenue earning equipment for the purposes of recording depreciation expense. Based on the results of our analysis, we may adjust the estimated residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment each year. Reductions in estimated residual values or useful lives will increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the vehicle. Conversely, an increase in estimated residual values or useful lives will decrease depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the vehicle. At the end of the vehicle's useful life or end of the lease term, the vehicle is either sold to a third party or purchased by the lessee, in which case we may record a gain or loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sales price. 
 
 Our review of the estimated residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment is based on vehicle class (i.e., generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage), historical and current market prices, third-party expected future market prices, expected lives of vehicles, and expected sales in the wholesale or retail markets, among other factors. A variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause residual value estimates to differ from actual used vehicle sales pricing, such as changes in supply and demand of used vehicles; volatility in market conditions; changes in vehicle technology; competitor pricing; regulatory requirements; wholesale market prices; customer requirements and preferences; and changes in underlying assumption factors. As a result, future residual value estimates and resulting depreciation expense are subject to change based upon these factors. We have disciplines related to the management and maintenance of our vehicles designed to manage the risk associated with the residual values of our revenue earning equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not adjust the estimated residual values and useful lives of existing revenue earning equipment. 
 Used Vehicle S ales and Valuation Adjustments 
 
 Revenue earning equipment held for sale is stated at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Losses on vehicles held for sale for which carrying values exceeded fair value, which we refer to as "valuation adjustments," are recognized at the time they are deemed to meet the held-for-sale criteria and are presented within "Used vehicle sales, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For revenue earning equipment held for sale, we stratify our fleet by vehicle type (trucks, tractors and trailers), weight class, age and other relevant characteristics and create classes of similar assets for analysis purposes. For revenue earning equipment held for sale, fair value was determined based upon recent market prices obtained from our own sales experience for each class of similar assets and vehicle condition, if available, or third-party market pricing. In addition, we

 share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors in October 2023. The first program authorized management to repurchase up to million shares issued to employees under our employee stock plans since August 31, 2023, under an anti-dilutive program (the "2023 Anti-Dilutive Program"). The second program granted management discretion to repurchase up to million shares of common stock over a period of under a discretionary share repurchase program (the "October 2023 Discretionary Program"). The 2023 Anti-Dilutive Program commenced October 12, 2023, and expires October 12, 2025. The October 2023 Discretionary Program commenced October 12, 2023 and was completed during the third quarter of 2024, upon the aggregate repurchase of million shares of common stock. Share repurchases under the 2023 Anti-Dilutive Program can be made from time to time using our working capital and other borrowing sources. Shares are repurchased under open-market transactions and trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors, including balance sheet leverage, availability of acquisitions and stock price. 
 
 In October 2024, our board of directors approved a new discretionary share repurchase program (the "October 2024 Discretionary Program"). Under the October 2024 Discretionary Program, management is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of common stock, at its discretion, over a period of from October 9, 2024, to October 9, 2026. 
 
 The discretionary share repurchase programs are designed to provide management with capital structure flexibility while concurrently managing objectives related to balance sheet leverage, acquisition opportunities, and shareholder returns. The anti-dilutive share repurchase programs are designed to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our employee stock plans.

shareholder derivative complaints were filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors (the "Derivative Cases"). The Derivative Cases are generally based on the allegations set forth in the Securities Class Action and allege breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets. In September 2023, the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve the Derivative Cases in exchange for certain specified corporate reforms, subject to the execution of definitive settlement documentation and court approval. We expect that any settlement amount of plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with the settlement of the Derivative Cases also will be covered by insurance, and accordingly is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) set forth a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15 for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar Two), with certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024, and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the U.S. has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar Two as of September 30, 2024, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar Two. We do not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash flows.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included under Item 1, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related MD A included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 General 
 
 We operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors, including service quality, price, technology and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including food and beverage service, retail and consumer goods, transportation and logistics, automotive, industrial, housing, technology, and business and personal services. 
 
 SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS 
 
 Diluted EPS from continuing operations of 3.25 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.44 in prior year 
 Comparable EPS (a non-GAAP measure) from continuing operations of 3.44 in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 3.58 in prior year, reflecting weaker market conditions in rental and used vehicle sales, partially offset by higher earnings in contractual lease, supply chain, and dedicated transportation businesses 
 Total revenue of 3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.9 billion in prior year 
 Operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) of 2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024, up 9 , reflecting recent acquisitions 
 Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE) (a non-GAAP measure) of 16 for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 
 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of 1.7 billion and free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) of 218 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 

Business Trends 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, market conditions for used vehicle sales and commercial rental remained weak. Although we are experiencing near-term sales headwinds that reflect the extended freight downturn and overall economic uncertainty, we continue to benefit from favorable long-term secular trends in logistics and transportation solutions. These secular trends provide long-term growth opportunities for our Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) and Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) business segments. 
 
 In our Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business, rental demand and used vehicle pricing declined from the prior year. We now anticipate that market conditions, including a freight recessionary environment, will remain weak through the end of 2024 for rental and used vehicle sales. Our maintenance cost savings initiatives continue to benefit earnings, and our lease pricing initiatives are delivering improved portfolio returns. We expect to continue to realize incremental earnings benefits as our remaining portfolio is renewed at higher returns. 
 
 In our SCS business, the acquisition of IFS as well as brokerage and logistics business from the acquisition of Cardinal Logistics drove total SCS revenue and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The dedicated business from the Cardinal Logistics acquisition drove operating revenue growth in DTS during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we expect this acquisition to continue to significantly benefit DTS revenue for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 While we are experiencing positive momentum from long-term secular trends in our businesses, other unknown effects from inflationary cost pressures, labor interruptions, disruptions in vehicle and vehicle part production and the higher interest rate environment may negatively impact demand for our business, financial results and significant judgments and estimates.

 Total revenue was 3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 2.9 billion in the prior year, and 9.4 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.8 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher operating revenue and higher subcontracted transportation. Operating rev enue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) increased 9 in the third quarter of 2024 and 8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , reflecting recent acquisitions and contractual revenue growth in FMS and SCS, partially offset by lower commercial rental revenue in FMS. 
 
 EBT decreased to 188 million in the third quarter largely reflecting weaker rental demand and lower gains on used vehicle sales due to lower volumes and pricing in FMS. EBT increased to 480 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to a 2023 one-time, non-cash 188 million currency translation adjustment loss related to the FMS U.K. business exit, partially offset by lower comparable EBT (a non-GAAP measure). C omparable EBT decreased 12 and 20 in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to decreased commercial rental results and reduced gains on used vehicles sold in FMS, partially offset by higher ChoiceLease results in FMS as well as SCS and DTS earnings.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
 Services Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Change 2024/2023 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Three Months Nine Months Services revenue 2,097 1,799 6,248 5,399 17 16 Cost of services 1,774 1,524 5,311 4,638 16 15 Gross margin 323 275 937 761 17 23 Gross margin 15 15 15 14 
 
 Services revenue represents all the revenue associated with our SCS and DTS business segments, including subcontracted transportation and fuel, as well as SelectCare and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 17 in the third quarter and 16 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increases in DTS and SCS revenue primarily driven by recent acquisitions. 
 
 Cost of services represents the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee-related costs, subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties), fuel, vehicle liability costs and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 16 in the third quarter of 2024 reflecting higher revenue. Cost of services increased 15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by a 30 million SCS asset impairment charge in the prior year. 
 
 Services gross margin increased 17 in the third quarter and increased 23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by recent acquisitions in DTS and SCS. Services gross margin increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also reflects an SCS asset impairment charge in the prior year. 
 Lease Related Maintenance and Rental Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Change 2024/2023 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Three Months Nine Months Lease related maintenance and rental revenue 960 986 2,844 2,941 (3) (3) Cost of lease related maintenance and rental 646 666 1,960 2,001 (3) (2) Gross margin 314 320 884 940 (2) (6) Gross margin 33 32 31 32 
 
 Lease related maintenance and rental revenue represent revenue from our ChoiceLease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS business segment. Revenue decreased 3 in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting lower rental demand partially offset by ChoiceLease growth. 
 
 Cost of lease related maintenance and rental represents the direct costs related to Lease related maintenance and rental revenue and are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease related maintenance and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing, which are reported within "Interest expense" in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cost of lease related maintenance and rental decreased 3 in the third quarter and 2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting lower operating costs on a 10 smaller average commercial rental fleet, lower maintenance costs on a younger fleet and maintenance cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Lease related maintenance and rental gross margin decreased in the third quarter and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower rental demand. Lease related maintenance and rental gross margin percentage increased in the third quarter due to higher rate in Choicelease and decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower rental utilization.

 Fuel services revenue represents fuel services provided to our FMS customers. Fuel services revenue decreased 20 in the third quarter and 15 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting lower fuel prices passed through to customers. 
 
 Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee-related costs of fuel island attendants, and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel services decreased 21 in the third quarter and 17 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of lower market fuel prices. 
 
 Fuel services gross margin increased in the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Fuel services gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased compared to prior year for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Fuel is largely a pass-through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel is established based on current market fuel costs. Fuel services gross margin for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was not significantly impacted by these price change dynamics as fuel prices fluctuated during the periods. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Change 2024/2023 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Three Months Nine Months Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) 368 347 1,113 1,053 6 6 Percentage of total revenue 12 12 12 12 
 
 SG A expenses increased 6 in the third quarter of 2024 and 6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the third quarter primarily reflects higher incentive-based compensation expenses and the increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects the impact from recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower advertising expense. SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained at 12 for the third quarter and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Used vehicle sales, net includes gains or losses from sales of used vehicles, selling costs associated with used vehicles and write-downs of vehicles held for sale to fair market values (referred to as "valuation adjustments"). Used vehicle sales, net decreased in the third quarter due to lower proceeds per unit on sales of used vehicles and decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to lower proceeds per unit on sales of used vehicles partially offset by higher volumes. 
 
 Average proceeds per unit decreased in the third quarter and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following table presents the average used vehicle pricing changes for North America compared to the prior year: Proceeds per unit change 2024/2023 (1)

 Interest expense increased 31 in the third quarter and 35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting higher market interest rates on new debt issuances and refinancings, as well as increased debt borrowings to fund recent acquisitions and share repurchases.

 Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income, interest income, gains on sales of operating property, foreign currency transaction remeasurement and other non-operating items. Miscellaneous income, net increased to 10 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher investment income offset by lower gains on sales of properties. Miscellaneous income, net decreased to 29 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to lower gains on sales of properties, offset by higher investment income.

 Our effective tax rate on continuing operations was 24.0 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 25.2 in the prior year, and 26.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 38.5 in the prior year. The higher effective tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the second quarter 2023 one-time, nondeductible cumulative currency translation adjustment loss from the FMS U.K. business exit. Our comparable tax rate, which excludes the impact of the prior year currency translation adjustment loss, was lower at 23.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 27.0 in the prior year, and 26.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27.2 in the prior year. The decrease in the comparable tax rate was due to discrete tax benefits during the third quarter of 2024.

 (2) Refer to Note 12, "Employee Benefit Plans," for a discussion on this item. 
 (3) Refer to Note 13, "Other Items Impacting Comparability," and below for a discussion of items excluded from our primary measure of segment performance. 
 
 As part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as segment "Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes" (EBT), which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS), and excludes Non-operating pension costs, net, intangible amortization expense, and certain other items as discussed in Note 13, "Other Items Impacting Comparability," in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including finance and procurement, corporate services, human resources, information technology, public affairs, legal, marketing and corporate communications. 
 
 The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Certain corporate costs are not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS, including costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. 
 
 Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides rental vehicles, fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to the SCS and DTS segments. Inter-segment EBT allocated to SCS and DTS includes earnings related to equipment

 used in providing services to SCS and DTS customers. EBT related to inter-segment equipment and services billed to SCS and DTS customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the segment that served the customer and then eliminated upon consolidation (presented as "Eliminations"). 
 
 The following table sets forth the benefits from equipment contribution included in EBT for our SCS and DTS business segments: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Change 2024/2023 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Three Months Nine Months Equipment Contribution: Supply Chain Solutions 11 10 33 32 8 3 Dedicated Transportation Solutions 23 13 64 41 76 58 Total

 FMS total revenue decreased 1 in the third quarter and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower fuel services revenue passed through to customers partially offset by higher operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel services revenue). FMS operating revenue increased 1 in the third quarter and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
 28

 due to higher ChoiceLease revenue, including the inter-segment lease revenue with DTS from the Cardinal Logistics acquisition. The increase in FMS operating revenue in both periods was partially offset by lower rental demand. 
 
 FMS EBT decreased 22 in the third quarter and 31 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting weaker rental demand and lower gains on used vehicle sales due to lower volumes and pricing, partially offset by higher ChoiceLease performance and benefits from maintenance cost savings initiatives. Lower gains on used vehicle sales reflect a 19 and 22 decrease in used truck and tractor pricing, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 and a 25 and 25 decrease in used truck and tractor pricing, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Rental power fleet utilization decreased to 71 in the third quarter and 69 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 75 in both the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average power fleet was 7 smaller in the third quarter of 2024 and 11 smaller in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations were 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.8 billion in the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher working capital needs, including a 50 million prefunding of future required pension contribution. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with 2023, reflecting the acquisition of Cardinal Logistics and decreased cash proceeds from sales of used vehicles and property, partially offset by lower cash paid for capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations increased to 65 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash used of 126 million in 2023, primarily reflecting higher borrowing needs.

 Gross capital expenditures decreased to 2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 billion in 2023, primarily reflecting reduced investments in the ChoiceLease fleet due to lower sales activity. 

Financing and Other Funding Transactions 
 
 We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset-based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long-term and medium-term public and private debt, asset-backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of unsecured commercial paper and medium-term notes. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 162 million as of September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024 , 98 million w as held outside the U.S. and is available to fund operations. Our intention is to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of our non-operating U.K. subsidiary where the assertion was removed in 2021 . Federal, state and foreign income taxes, withholding taxes and the tax impact of foreign currency exchange gains or losses were considered on the remaining U.K. undistributed earnings as of September 30, 2024, and there was no impact to deferred taxes. 
 
 We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to the public unsecured bond market, commercial paper market and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, volatility or disruption in the public unsecured debt market or the commercial paper market may impair our ability to access these markets or secure terms commercially acceptable to us. If we cease to have access to public bonds, commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements or by seeking other funding sources.

In February 2024, we issued two tranches of unsecured medium-term notes with aggregate principal amounts of 350 million and 550 million, bearing annual interest of 5.30 and 5.38 , respectively, and maturing on March 15, 2027 and March 15, 2029, respectively. In May 2024, we issued an unsecured medium-term note with aggregate principal amount of 300 million, bearing annual interest of 5.50 , and maturing on June 1, 2029. In August 2024, we issued an unsecured medium-term note with aggregate principal amount of 300 million, bearing annual interest of 4.95 , and maturing on September 1, 2029. 
 
 Refer to Note 8, "Debt," in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our global revolving credit facility, trade receivables financing program, medium-term notes and asset-backed financing obligations. 
 
 Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is impacted by both our short-term and long-term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with our particular securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our debt securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A significant downgrade of our short-term debt ratings would impair our ability to issue commercial paper and likely require us to rely on alternative funding sources. A significant downgrade would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our global revolving credit facility described below, assuming ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. 
 
 Our debt ratings and rating outlooks as of September 30, 2024, were as follows: Rating Summary Short-term Long-term Outlook Standard Poor s Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable Moody s Investors Service (1) 
 P2 Baa2 Positive Fitch Ratings F2 BBB+ Positive 
 
 (1) In August 2024, the rating outlook was upgraded to positive. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility 423 Trade receivables financing program 223 

In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to align the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re-pricing life of our vehicle assets. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to achieve this alignment and generally target a mix of 20 - 40 va riable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable-rate portion of our total debt (including notional value of swap agreeme nts) was 20 and 16 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Our debt-to-equity ratio was 249 and 232 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The debt-to-equity ratio represents total debt divided by total equity. 

Share Repurchases and Cash Dividends . 
 
 Refer to Note 9, "Share Repurchase Programs," in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. 
 
 In October 2024 and 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.81 and 0.71 per share of common stock, respectively.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information extracted from c ondensed consolidated financial information, but not required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain elements of this information are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined by SEC rules. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in this non-GAAP financial measures section or in the MD A above. We also provide the reasons why management believes each non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in this section. 
 Specifically, we refer to the following non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q:

 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Set forth in the table below is an overview of each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that the presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. 
 Operating Revenue Measures: 
 Operating Revenue FMS Operating Revenue SCS Operating Revenue DTS Operating Revenue FMS EBT as a of FMS Operating Revenue SCS EBT as a of SCS Operating Revenue DTS EBT as a of DTS Operating Revenue Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for Ryder or each business segment (FMS, SCS and DTS) excluding any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted transportation. We use operating revenue to evaluate the operating performance of our core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well as for each of our business segments. We also use segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason. Note: FMS EBT, SCS EBT and DTS EBT, our primary measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP measures. 
 
 Fuel : We exclude FMS, SCS and DTS fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers. Fuel revenue is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices and the costs are largely a pass-through to our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on current market fuel costs. 
 
 Subcontracted transportation: We exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as these services are also typically a pass-through to our customers and, therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability. While our SCS and DTS business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers, our FMS business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and, therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS. 
 Comparable Earnings Measures: 
 Comparable Earnings before Income Taxes (EBT) Comparable Earnings Comparable Earnings per Diluted Common Share (EPS) Comparable Tax Rate Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE) Comparable EBT, Comparable Earnings and Comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs, net and (2) other items impacting comparability (as further described below). We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance. 
 
 Non-operating pension costs, net: Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, net, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs, as well as any significant charges for settlements or curtailments if recognized. We exclude non-operating pension costs, net because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business. 
 
 Other Items Impacting Comparability: Our comparable and adjusted earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations and vary from period to period. 
 
 Comparable Tax Rate is computed using the same methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the marginal tax rates to which the non-GAAP adjustments are related. 
 
 Adjusted ROE is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by adjusted average shareholders' equity and represents the rate of return on shareholders' investment. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted average shareholders' equity. We also exclude any significant charges for pension settlements or curtailments from the calculation of adjusted net earnings. We use adjusted ROE as an internal measure of how effectively we use the owned capital invested in our operations.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Comparable Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Comparable EBITDA is defined as net earnings, first adjusted to exclude discontinued operations and the following items, all from continuing operations: (1) non-operating pension costs, net and (2) any other items that are not representative of our business operations (these items are the same items that are excluded from comparable earnings measures for the relevant periods as described immediately above) and then adjusted further for (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation, (4) used vehicle sales results and (5) amortization. 
 
 We believe comparable EBITDA provides investors with useful information, as it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties to measure financial performance and our ability to service debt and meet our payment obligations. We believe that the inclusion of comparable EBITDA also provides consistency in financial reporting and aids investors in performing meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. Our presentation of comparable EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 
 
 Comparable EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Cash Flow Measures: 
 Total Cash Generated Free Cash Flow We consider total cash generated and free cash flow to be important measures of comparative operating performance, as our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. 
 
 Total Cash Generated is defined as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment and (4) other cash inflows from investing activities. We believe total cash generated is an important measure of total cash flows generated from our ongoing business activities. 
 
 Free Cash Flow is defined as the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding acquisitions) from continuing operations. We calculate free cash flow as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, and (3) other cash inflows from investing activities, less (4) purchases of property and revenue earning equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders, after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 
 See Total Cash Generated and Free Cash Flow reconciliations in the Financial Resources and Liquidity section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) are statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements are often preceded by or include the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "will," "may," "could," "should" or similar expressions. This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements including statements regarding: 
 
 our expectations regarding used vehicle sales and commercial rental; 
 our expectations with respect to the freight cycle and general economic environment; 
 our expectations with respect to the impacts of outsourcing and other secular trends in our SCS and DTS business segments and on our business and financial results; 
 our expectations regarding the supply of vehicles and vehicle parts and its effect on pricing and demand; 
 our expectations regarding the impact of seasonal labor shortages and interruptions and subcontracted transportation costs; 
 our expectations regarding ChoiceLease revenue and earnings; 
 our expectations in our SCS and DTS business segments related to revenue, earnings growth and contract sales activity; 
 our expectations of cash flow from operating activities, free cash flow and full-year guidance; 
 the adequacy of our accounting estimates and reserves for goodwill, intangible assets and other asset impairments, residual values and other depreciation assumptions, deferred income taxes and annual effective tax rates, variable revenue considerations, the valuation of our pension plans, allowance for credit losses and self-insurance loss reserves; 
 the adequacy of our fair value estimates of publicly traded debt and other debt; 
 our ability to fund all of our operating, investing and financial needs for the foreseeable future through internally generated funds and outside funding sources; 
 our expected level of use and availability of outside funding sources, anticipated future payments under debt and lease agreements, and risk of losses resulting from counterparty default under hedging and derivative agreements; 
 our ability to meet our objectives with the share repurchase programs; 
 the anticipated impact of fuel and energy prices, interest rate movements and exchange rate fluctuations; 
 our expectations as to return on pension plan assets and future pension expense; 
 our expectations regarding the scope and anticipated outcomes with respect to certain claims, proceedings and lawsuits;

 our ability to access commercial paper and other available debt financing in the capital markets; 
 our intent to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries; 
 our expectations regarding the benefits from our strategic investments and initiatives, including our maintenance and lease pricing initiatives; 
 our expectations regarding recent acquisitions, including Cardinal Logistics; 
 the anticipated impact of inflationary pressures; 
 our expectations of the long-term residual values of revenue earnings equipment, including the probability of incurring losses or having to decrease residual value estimates in the event of a potential cyclical downturn or changes to the estimated useful lives; and 
 our expectations regarding U.S. federal, state and foreign tax positions and the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in foreign tax rates. 
 These statements, as well as other forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We caution readers that certain important factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, among others, include the following: 
 Market Conditions: 
 Changes in general economic and financial conditions in the U.S. and worldwide leading to decreased demand for our services and products, lower profit margins, increased levels of bad debt, and reduced access to credit and financial markets. 
 Decreases in freight demand which would impact both our transactional and variable-based contractual business. 
 Changes in our customers' operations, financial condition or business environment that may limit their demand for, or ability to purchase, our services and products. 
 Decreases in market demand affecting the commercial rental market and used vehicle sales as well as global economic conditions. 
 Volatility in customer volumes and shifting customer demand in the industries we service. 
 Changes in current financial, tax or other regulatory requirements that could negatively impact our financial and operating results. 
 Financial institution disruptions and the impacts of geopolitical events or conflicts. 
 Competition: 
 Advances in technology may impact demand for our services or may require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments. 
 Competition from other service providers, some of which may have greater capital resources or lower capital costs, or from our customers, who may choose to provide services themselves. 
 Continued consolidation in the markets where we operate, which may create large competitors with greater financial resources. 
 Our inability to maintain current pricing levels due to economic conditions, demand for services, customer acceptance or competition.
