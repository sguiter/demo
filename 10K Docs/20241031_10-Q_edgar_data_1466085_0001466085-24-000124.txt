 Overview 
 Our Company 
 We are a self-administered and self-managed Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT ). We are primarily engaged in the ownership, operation, management, improvement, and acquisition of multifamily apartment communities in non-gateway markets. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and operated 110 multifamily apartment properties (including one owned through a consolidated joint venture) that contain an aggregate of 32,670 units. Our properties are located in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we owned and consolidated two investments in real estate under development in Colorado that will, upon completion, contain an aggregate of 621 units. As of September 30, 2024, we also owned interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures, two that own and operate multifamily apartment communities that contain an aggregate of 810 units and two that are developing multifamily apartment communities that will contain, upon completion, an aggregate of 653 units. We do not have any foreign operations and our business is not seasonal. 
 Our Business Objective and Investment Strategies 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value through diligent portfolio management, strong operational performance, and a consistent return of capital through distributions and capital appreciation. Our investment strategy is focused on the following: 
 gaining scale within key amenity rich submarkets of non-gateway cities that offer good school districts, high-quality retail and major employment centers and are unlikely to experience substantial new apartment construction in the foreseeable future; 
 increasing cash flows at our existing apartment properties through prudent property management and strategic renovation projects; and 
 acquiring and developing additional properties that have strong and stable occupancies and support a rise in rental rates or that have the potential for repositioning through capital expenditures or tailored management strategies.

 Current Developments 
 Dispositions 
 On July 17, 2024, we sold one multifamily apartment community in Birmingham, Alabama for a gross sales price of 70.8 million. We used the proceeds from this sale as part of a 1031 exchange to acquire the Gateway at Pinellas property described below. 
 Acquisitions 
 On August 13, 2024, we acquired Gateway at Pinellas in Tampa, Florida, a 288-unit multifamily apartment community for 82.0 million. This acquisition expanded our footprint in Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida from 1,503 units to 1,791 units. 
 
 We are currently under contract on acquisitions of three properties in Charlotte, Orlando, and Columbus, which will expand our footprint in each of these markets while providing enhanced scale and synergies. The aggregate purchase price of these three properties is approximately 184 million, which we expect to fund using forward equity sales proceeds and revolver debt. We expect to close on the acquisition of these three properties during the fourth quarter of 2024. While these three properties are under contract, there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will be consummated at expected pricing levels, within expected time frames, or at all. 
 Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy 
 On October 26, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a plan, which we refer to as our Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy, which targeted the sale of ten properties located in seven markets in order to exit or reduce our presence in these markets while also deleveraging our balance sheet. 
 In 2024, the Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy concluded with the sale of six properties in four markets for an aggregate gross sales price of 324.6 million, and proceeds from the sales were used to repay an aggregate of 320.3 million of debt. The Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy resulted in the sale of ten properties for an aggregate gross sales price of 525.3 million and proceeds from the sales were used to repay an aggregate of 517.1 million of debt. 
 Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities 
 To create another avenue for accretive capital allocation and to increase our options for capital investment, we have partnered with, and may in the future partner with, developers through preferred equity investments and joint venture relationships focused on new multifamily development. 
 No new investments in unconsolidated real estate entities were entered into during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, we continued to fund commitments to our existing investments in unconsolidated real estate entities. On July 16, 2024, we amended the related joint venture agreement governing the entity that owns The Crockett, which resulted in the return of our invested capital in the amount of 5.5 million and preferred return in the amount of 3.0 million thereon on October 17, 2024, while also providing us with a right of first refusal on any sale of The Crockett. The amendment of the joint venture agreement also converted the right of first offer on the Views of Music City II to a right of first refusal. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had investments in unconsolidated real estate entities of 95.4 million and 89.0 million, respectively. 
 Investments in Real Estate Under Development 
 As part of our merger with Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc. (the STAR Merger ), we acquired two land parcels in Denver, Colorado that are being developed into multifamily properties that will contain 621 units, in the aggregate, upon completion. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had investments in real estate under development of 115.2 million and 98.4 million, respectively, net of 102.2 million and 77.5 million placed in service, respectively. 
 Value Add 
 Our value add program provides us with the opportunity to improve long-term growth through targeted unit renovations at communities where there is the potential for outsized rent growth. We completed renovations on 578 units during the three months ended September 30, 2024. From inception of our value add program in January 2018 through 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024, we completed renovations on 9,047 of the 13,281 units currently in our value add program, achieving a return on investment of 16.9 (and approximately 18.9 on the interior portion of such renovation costs). We compute return on cost by using the rent premium per unit per month, multiplied by 12, divided by the applicable renovation costs per unit and we compute the rent premium as the difference between the rental rate on the renovated unit (excluding the impact of concessions) and the market rent for a comparable unrenovated unit as of the date presented, as determined by management consistent with its customary rent-setting and evaluation procedures. 

Capital Markets 
 Completed Public Offering of 11.5 Million Shares of Common Stock 
 On September 3, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets LLC as representatives of the several underwriters named therein, (collectively, the Underwriters ), and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in its capacity as agent (in such capacity, the Forward Seller for Citibank, N.A., as forward counterparty (the Forward Counterparty and the Forward Counterparty related to the offering of an aggregate of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, at a price of 18.96 per share consisting of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock offered by the Forward Seller in connection with the forward sale agreements described below (including 1,500,000 shares offered pursuant to the Underwriter s option to purchase additional shares, which was exercised in full).

The first forward sale agreement (the Initial Forward Sale Agreement ), dated September 3, 2024, with the Forward Seller and Forward Counterparty, and the second forward sale agreement (the Additional Forward Sale Agreement , together with the Initial Forward Sale Agreement, the Forward Sale Agreements ), dated September 4, 2024, with the Forward Seller and the Forward Counterparty. In connection with the Forward Sale Agreements, the Forward Seller (or its affiliate) borrowed from third parties and sold to the Underwriters an aggregate of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock that was sold in the offering. As of September 30, 2024, 11,500,000 shares of our common stock remain to be settled under the Forward Sale Agreements, which if physically settled would provide additional proceeds to us of 216.8 million based on the forward price as of September 30, 2024. We expect to physically settle the Forward Sale Agreements and receive proceeds, subject to certain adjustments, from the sale of those shares upon one or more such physical settlements within approximately twelve months from the date of the prospectus supplement, no later than September 5, 2025, the scheduled maturity date of the Forward Sale Agreements. Although we expect to settle the Forward Sale Agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock for cash proceeds, we may also elect to cash or net share settle all or a portion of our obligations under the Forward Sale Agreements, in which case, we may receive or owe cash or shares of our common stock from or to the Forward Seller. The Forward Sale Agreements provide for an initial forward sale price of 18.96 per share, subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the terms of each of the Forward Sale Agreements. The Forward Sale Agreements are subject to early termination or settlement under certain circumstances.

On October 1, 2024, the Private Placement was funded with proceeds to be used to repay approximately 132 million of property mortgages maturing in late 2024 and early 2025, with the remaining 18 million to reduce the borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. Upon completion of the full repayment of the foregoing approximately 132 million of our maturing property mortgages, it is expected that over 60 of our assets NOI will be unencumbered. 
 Shelf Registration Statement and ATM Program 
 On June 14, 2023, we replaced our previous shelf registration statement with our new shelf registration statement.

 Revenue 
 Rental and other property revenue . Revenue from rental and other property revenue of the consolidated portfolio decreased 8.5 million to 159.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 168.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 12.3 million decrease in non same-store rental and other property revenue driven by the sale of ten properties under the Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy, partially offset by an increase in same-store rental and other property revenue of 3.8 million driven by a 1.2 increase in average effective monthly rents and a 0.9 increase in average occupancy compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses . Property operating expenses decreased 2.8 million to 60.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 63.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 4.4 million decrease in property operating expenses due to the sale of ten properties under our Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy partially offset by a net 1.6 million increase in same-store property operating expense, driven by an increase in personnel expenses, repairs and maintenance, and utilities partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes. 
 General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses increased 1.1 million to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the prior year period including the reversal of stock compensation and bonus expense related to executive departures that occurred in 2023. 
 Casualty losses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 1.2 million in net casualty losses primarily due to fire damage at one property where the carrying value of the damage exceeded insurance proceeds due to policy deductibles. 
 Interest expense . Interest expense decreased 3.7 million to 18.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the reduction of debt associated with the sale of ten properties under the Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy. 
 Gain on sale (loss on impairment) of real estate assets, net . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold one multi-family property resulting in a small gain on sale of real estate assets, net. Previously, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had recorded a loss on impairment of 15.1 million related to that property. During the three months September 30, 2023, we recorded a 11.3 million impairment charge in connection with a property that was held for sale.

 Revenue 
 Rental and other property revenue . Revenue from rental and other property revenue of the consolidated portfolio decreased 14.8 million to 478.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 493.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 28.8 million decrease in non same-store rental and other property revenue driven by the sale of ten properties under the Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy. This decrease in non same-store rental and other property revenue was partially offset by an increase in same-store rental and other property revenue of 14.0 million driven by a 1.4 increase in average effective monthly rents and a 1.1 increase in average occupancy compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses . Property operating expenses decreased 3.2 million to 181.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 184.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 10.3 million decrease in property operating expenses due to the sale of ten properties under our Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy partially offset by a net 7.1 million increase in same-store property operating expenses, primarily due to higher personnel expenses, utilities, property insurance, and advertising expenses, partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes. 
 Property management expenses. Property management expenses increased 2.1 million to 22.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher personnel costs driven by employee retention credits recognized in 2023 and higher software costs driven by centralization efforts. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 1.7 million to 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the prior year period including the reversal of stock compensation and bonus expense related to executive departures that occurred in 2023 and employee retention credits recognized in 2023. 
 Casualty losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 4.0 million in casualty losses due to winter storm damage and fire at various properties where the carrying value of the damage exceeded insurance proceeds due to policy deductibles. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 0.9 million in casualty losses due to fires at three properties where the carrying value of the damage exceeded insurance proceeds due to policy deductibles. 
 Interest expense . Interest expense decreased 10.0 million to 56.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 66.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the reduction of debt associated with the sale of ten properties under the Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy. 
 Gain on sale (loss on impairment) of real estate assets, net . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold seven multi-family properties and recognized a gain on sale of real estate, net of 11.1 million comprised of a 26.2 million gain on sale of real estate, net, partially offset by a loss on impairment of 15.1 million for one property. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, one multifamily property in Chicago, Illinois was sold for a gain of 1.0 million and we recorded a 11.3 million impairment charge due to the carrying value exceeding the expected sales price less transaction costs. 
 Restructuring costs . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred no restructuring costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred approximately 3.2 million of severance costs related to the reorganization of certain departments that impacted a limited number of employees.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations (FFO) and Core Funds from Operations (CFFO) 
 We believe that FFO and Core FFO CFFO ), each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and us in particular. We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), as net income or loss allocated to common shares (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses on sales of real estate and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. While our calculation of FFO is in accordance with NAREIT s definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to FFO computations of such other REITs. 
 CFFO is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, including depreciation and amortization of other items not included in FFO, and other non-cash or non-operating gains or losses related to items such as casualty (gains) losses, loan premium accretion and discount amortization, debt extinguishment costs, and restructuring costs from the determination of FFO. 
 Our calculation of CFFO may differ from the methodology used for calculating CFFO by other REITs and, accordingly, our CFFO may not be comparable to CFFO reported by other REITs. Our management utilizes FFO and CFFO as measures of our operating performance, and believe they are also useful to investors, because they facilitate an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for certain non-cash or non-recurring items that are required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and our operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO, CFFO and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, we believe that FFO and CFFO may provide us and our investors with an additional useful measure to compare our financial performance to certain other REITs. Neither FFO nor CFFO is equivalent to net income or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and CFFO do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Accordingly, FFO and CFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization and capital improvements. Neither FFO nor CFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of our liquidity.

 Same-Store Portfolio Net Operating Income 
 We believe that Net Operating Income NOI ), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding interest expenses, depreciation and amortization, casualty related costs and gains, property management expenses, general and administrative expense, net gains on sale of assets, and restructuring costs. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income insofar as the measure reflects only operating income and expense at the property level. We use NOI to evaluate performance on a same-store and non same-store basis because NOI measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses, financing expenses, and other items not related to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. 
 Same-Store Properties and Same-Store Portfolio 
 We review our same-store portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year. Properties are added into the same-store portfolio if they were owned and not a development property at the beginning of the previous year. Properties that are held for sale or have been sold are excluded from the same-store portfolio. 
 Non Same-Store Properties and Non Same-Store Portfolio 
 Properties that did not meet the definition of a same-store property as of the beginning of the previous year are added into the non same-store portfolio.

 Average Effective Monthly Rent per Unit 
 Average effective rent per unit represents the average of net rent amounts, after concessions amortized over the life of the lease, divided by the average occupancy (in units) for the period presented. We believe average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. This metric, when presented, reflects the average effective rent per month. 
 Average Occupancy 
 Average occupancy represents the average occupied units for the reporting period divided by the average of total units available for rent for the reporting period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain investments, pay distributions and other general business needs. We believe our available cash balances, financing arrangements and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements with respect to our existing portfolio for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. 
 Our primary cash requirements are to: 
 make investments to continue our value add initiatives to improve the quality and performance of our properties; 
 repay our indebtedness; 
 fund costs necessary to maintain our properties; 
 continue funding our current real estate developments until completion; 
 pay our operating expenses; and 
 distribute a minimum of 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) and to make investments in a manner that enables us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 We intend to meet our liquidity requirements primarily through a combination of one or more of the following: 
 the use of our cash and cash equivalents of 17.6 million as of September 30, 2024; 
 existing and future unsecured financing, including advances under our unsecured credit facility, and financing secured directly or indirectly by the apartment properties in our portfolio; 
 cash generated from operating activities; 
 37

 net cash proceeds from property sales, including sales undertaken as part of our capital recycling strategy and other sales; and 
 proceeds from the sales of our common stock and other equity securities, including common stock that may be sold under our ATM program. 
 Cash Flows 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we maintained cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately 48.2 million and 49.0 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents were generated from the following activities (dollars in thousands): For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Cash flow provided by operating activities 196,319 202,992 Cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities 170,943 (142,617) Cash flow used in financing activities (369,751) (55,404) Net change in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (2,489) 4,971 Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 50,732 44,017 Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of the period 48,243 48,988 
 Our cash inflows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by ongoing operations of our properties. 
 Our cash inflows from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to 390.8 million of proceeds from the disposition of seven properties, which included six properties targeted for sale under our Portfolio Optimization and Deleveraging Strategy, and 4.0 million of proceeds from insurance claims, partially offset by 92.1 million of capital expenditures, 81.2 million to acquire one multifamily property, 41.9 million of investments in real estate under development and 8.9 million of investments in unconsolidated real estate entities. Our cash outflows from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to 111.9 million of capital expenditures, 23.2 million of investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, and 48.5 million of investments in real estate under development, partially offset by 35.6 million of proceeds from one property disposition. 
 Our cash outflows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to mortgage principal repayments of 211.1 million, net repayments on our unsecured credit facility of 43.7 million and payment of dividends on our common stock and noncontrolling interests of 110.9 million. Our cash outflows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to payment of dividends on our common stock and noncontrolling interests of 101.6 million partially offset by 57.5 million of net draws on our unsecured credit facility.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations. Matters which arise out of allegations of bodily injury, property damage, and employment practices are generally covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Starting around November 2022, putative class action representatives began filing complaints in various United States District Courts across the country naming as defendants RealPage, Inc. RealPage ), a seller of revenue management products, and approximately 50 defendants who own and/or manage multifamily residential rental housing, alleging that the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize rent prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Some of the complaints, including one filed on November 14, 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, named us as one of the defendants, and others did not. On April 10, 2023, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the cases to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings, where plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. We filed an answer to the consolidated complaint and asserted affirmative defenses. We deny all allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend against these claims vigorously. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have not been any material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, holders of IROP units exchanged 0 and 4,928 units, respectively, for 0 and 4,928 shares, respectively, of our common stock. The issuance of these shares upon exchange of the units was exempt from registration under the Securities Act, pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. As of September 30, 2024, 5,941,643 IROP units held by unaffiliated third parties remained outstanding. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we withheld shares of common stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations payable upon the vesting of restricted common stock awards as follow: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share (1) 
 Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in thousands) (2) 
 July 1 - 31, 2024 1,545 18.79 250,000 August 1 - 31, 2024 250,000 September 1 - 30, 2024 250,000 Total 1,545 18.79 
 (1) The price reported is the average price paid per share using our closing price on the NYSE on the vesting date of the relevant award. 
 (2) On May 18, 2022, our Board of Directors approved the Stock Repurchase Program covering up to 250 million in shares of our common stock. Under the Stock Repurchase Program, we, in our discretion, may purchase our shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of the purchases will depend on a number of factors, including the price and availability of our shares, trading volumes and general market conditions. The Stock Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
