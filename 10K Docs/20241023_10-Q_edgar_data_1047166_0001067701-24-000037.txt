CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believe, expect, may, will, should, seek, on-track, plan, project, forecast, intend or anticipate, or the negative thereof or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy or outlook. You are cautioned that our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and, consequently, our actual results may differ materially from those projected. 
 
 Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the impact of global economic conditions (including inflation, interest rates, supply chain constraints, trade wars and sanctions), geopolitical risks (including risks related to international conflicts and the upcoming elections in the United States) and public health crises and epidemics on us, our customers and our suppliers, in the United States and the rest of the world; 
 declines in construction or industrial activity, which can adversely impact our revenues and, because many of our costs are fixed, our profitability; 
 rates we charge and time utilization we achieve being less than anticipated; 
 changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix; 
 excess fleet in the equipment rental industry; 
 inability to benefit from government spending, including spending associated with infrastructure projects, or a reduction in government spending; 
 trends in oil and natural gas, including significant increases in the prices of oil or natural gas, could adversely affect the demand for our services and products; 
 competition from existing and new competitors; 
 the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate and the industries of our customers, such as those in the construction industry; 
 costs we incur being more than anticipated, including as a result of inflation, and the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; 
 our significant indebtedness (which totaled 13.4 billion at September 30, 2024) requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; 
 inability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us, including as a result of volatility and uncertainty in capital or credit markets or increases in interest rates, or at all; 
 incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; 
 noncompliance with financial or other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in our lenders terminating the agreements and requiring us to repay outstanding borrowings; 
 restrictive covenants and the amount of borrowings permitted under our debt instruments, which can limit our financial and operational flexibility; 
 inability to access the capital that our businesses or growth plans may require, including as a result of uncertainty in capital or credit markets; 
 the possibility that companies that we have acquired or may acquire could have undiscovered liabilities, or that companies or assets that we have acquired or may acquire could involve other unexpected costs, may strain our management capabilities, or may be difficult to integrate, and that we may not realize the expected benefits from an acquisition over the timeframe we expect, or at all; 
 incurrence of impairment charges; 
 fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases or pay dividends in the time frames and/or on the terms anticipated; 
 our charter provisions as well as provisions of certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have the effect of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; 
 inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with a large number of customers; 
 turnover in our management team and inability to attract and retain key personnel, as well as loss, absenteeism or the inability of employees to work or perform key functions in light of public health crises or epidemics; 
 inability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all, as a result of supply chain disruptions, insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors; 
 increases in our maintenance and replacement costs and/or decreases in the residual value of our equipment; 
 inability to sell our new or used fleet in the amounts, or at the prices, we expect;

 risks related to security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, failure to protect personal information, compliance with privacy, data protection and cyber incident reporting laws and regulations, and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; 
 risks related to climate change and climate change regulation; 
 risks related to our environmental and social goals, including our greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal; 
 the fact that our holding company structure requires us to depend in part on distributions from subsidiaries and such distributions could be limited by contractual or legal restrictions; 
 shortfalls in our insurance coverage; 
 increases in our loss reserves to address business operations or other claims and any claims that exceed our established levels of reserves; 
 incurrence of expenses (including indemnification obligations) and other costs in connection with litigation, regulatory and investigatory matters; 
 the costs of complying with environmental, safety and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other risks associated with non-U.S. operations, including currency exchange risk, and tariffs; 
 the outcome or other potential consequences of regulatory and investigatory matters and litigation; 
 labor shortages and/or disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, which may impact our productivity and increase our costs, and changes in law that could affect our labor relations or operations generally; and 
 the effect of changes in tax law. 
 
 For a more complete description of these and other possible risks and uncertainties, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as to our subsequent filings with the SEC. Our forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date hereof, and we make no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.

 Revenues by reportable segment are presented in note 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements, using the revenue captions reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The majority of our revenue is recognized in our general rentals segment and in the U.S. (for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, percent and percent, respectively). We believe that the disaggregation of our revenue from contracts to customers as reflected above, coupled with the further discussion below and the reportable segment disclosures in note 4, depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. 
 
 percent of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024) and are governed by our standard rental contract. We account for such rentals as operating leases. The lease terms are included in our contracts, and the determination of whether our contracts contain leases generally does not require significant assumptions or judgments. Our lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable payments.

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As noted above, we are unsure of when the customer will return rented equipment. As such, we do not know how much the customer will owe us upon return of the equipment and cannot provide a maturity analysis of future lease payments. Our equipment is generally rented for short periods of time. Lessees do not provide residual value guarantees on rented equipment. 
 We expect to derive significant future benefits from our equipment following the end of the rental term. Our rentals are generally short-term in nature, and our equipment is typically rented for the majority of the time that we own it. We additionally recognize revenue from sales of rental equipment when we dispose of the equipment. 
 Re-rent revenue: Re-rent revenue reflects revenues from equipment that we rent from vendors and then rent to our customers. We account for such rentals as subleases. The accounting for re-rent revenue is the same as the accounting for owned equipment rentals described above. 
 Other equipment rental revenue is primarily comprised of 1) Rental Protection Plan (or "RPP") revenue associated with the damage waiver customers can purchase when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage, 2) environmental charges associated with the rental of equipment, 3) charges for rented equipment that is damaged by our customers and 4) charges for setup and other services performed on rented equipment.

percent of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). The customers that are responsible for the remaining revenue that is accounted for under Topic 606 are generally the same customers that rent our equipment. We manage credit risk associated with our accounts receivables at the customer level. Because the same customers generate the revenues that are accounted for under both Topic 606 and Topic 842, the discussions below on credit risk and our allowance for credit losses address receivables arising from revenues from both Topic 606 and Topic 842. 
 Concentration of credit risk with respect to our receivables is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers makes up our customer base. Our largest customer accounted for percent or less of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for each of the last three full years. Our customer with the largest receivable balance represented approximately percent of total receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We manage credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and other monitoring procedures. 
 Our allowance for credit losses reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance. Trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written-off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes. Write-offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds. See the table below for a rollforward of our allowance for credit losses. 
 The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Trade receivables are the only material financial asset we have that is subject to the requirement to measure expected credit losses as noted above, as this requirement does not apply to receivables arising from operating lease revenues. Substantially all of our non-lease trade receivables are due in one year or less. As discussed above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for as lease revenue (such revenue represented percent of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and these revenues account for corresponding portions of the billion of net accounts receivable and the associated allowance for credit losses of as of September 30, 2024). 
 As discussed above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for under Topic 842. The customers that are responsible for the remaining revenue that is accounted for under Topic 606 are generally the same customers that rent our equipment. We manage credit risk associated with our accounts receivables at the customer level.

t recognize material revenue during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 that was included in the contract liability balance as of the beginning of such periods. 
 
 Performance obligations 
 Most of our Topic 606 revenue is recognized at a point-in-time, rather than over time. Accordingly, in any particular period, we do not generally recognize a significant amount of revenue from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, and the amounts of such revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were t material. We also do not expect to recognize material revenue in the future related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Payment terms 
 Our Topic 606 revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. Our contracts do not generally include a significant financing component. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Our contracts with customers do not generally result in significant obligations associated with returns, refunds or warranties. See above for a discussion of how we manage credit risk. 
 Revenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 
 
 Contract costs 
 We do not recognize any assets associated with the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer (for example, a sales commission) that we expect to recover. Most of our revenue is recognized at a point-in-time or over a period of one year or less, and we use the practical expedient that allows us to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. 
 
 Contract estimates and judgments 
 Our revenues accounted for under Topic 606 generally do not require significant estimates or judgments, primarily for the following reasons: 
 The transaction price is generally fixed and stated in our contracts; 
 As noted above, our contracts generally do not include multiple performance obligations, and accordingly do not generally require estimates of the standalone selling price for each performance obligation; 
 Our revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, or result in significant obligations associated with returns, refunds or warranties; and 
 Most of our revenue is recognized as of a point-in-time and the timing of the satisfaction of the applicable performance obligations is readily determinable. As noted above, our Topic 606 revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer. 
 Our revenues accounted for under Topic 842 also generally do not require significant estimates or judgments. We monitor and review our estimated standalone selling prices on a regular basis.

and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. It is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amount of earnings of Yak since the acquisition date, primarily due to our corporate structure and the allocation of corporate costs. 
 Pro forma financial information 
 The pro forma information below gives effect to the Yak acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2023. Pro forma information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is excluded from the presentation below because Yak was included in our results for the entire period. Pro forma information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is presented below because Yak was not included in our results in 2024 prior to the acquisition date. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of our results had the acquisition been completed on the above date, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results. The pro forma information does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies that could result from the acquisition and also does not reflect additional revenue opportunities following the acquisition. The pro forma information includes adjustments to record the acquired assets and liabilities of Yak at their respective fair values and to give effect to the financing for the acquisition. The pro forma adjustments reflected in the table below are subject to change as additional analysis is performed. The purchase price allocations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the acquisition measurement period. Increases or decreases in the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired may impact our statements of income in future periods.

The repurchase facility is not included below because (i) there were no borrowings under it during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and (ii) it was terminated in May 2024. We have borrowed the full available amount under the term loan facility. The principal obligation under the term loan facility is required to be repaid in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to percent per annum, with the balance due at the maturity of the facility. The average amount of debt outstanding under the term loan facility decreases slightly each quarter due to the requirement to repay a portion of the principal obligation.

 (2) In May 2024, the accounts receivable securitization facility was amended, primarily to increase the facility size and extend the maturity date. The size of the facility, which expires on June 24, 2025, was increased to billion. The facility may be extended on a -day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility. Borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility are permitted only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool, net of applicable reserves and other deductions, exceeds the outstanding loans. As of September 30, 2024, there were billion of receivables, net of applicable reserves and other deductions, in the collateral pool. 
 (3) In February 2024, the term loan facility was amended, primarily to extend the maturity date to February 14, 2031 and to increase the facility size to billion (at the time of the amendment, the facility size was ). 
 (4) URNA separately issued 4 7 / 8 percent Senior Notes in August 2017 and in September 2017. Following the issuances, URNA consummated an exchange offer pursuant to which most of the 4 7 / 8 percent Senior Notes issued in September 2017 were exchanged for additional notes fungible with the 4 7 / 8 percent Senior Notes issued in August 2017. As of September 30, 2024, the total above is comprised of two separate 4 7 / 8 percent Senior Notes, one with a book value of billion and one with a book value of . 
 (5) In March 2024, URNA issued billion aggregate principal amount of 6 1 / 8 percent Senior Notes (the 6 1 / 8 percent Notes which are due March 15, 2034. The 6 1 / 8 percent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 6 1 / 8 percent Notes may be redeemed on or after March 15, 2029, at specified redemption prices that range from percent in 2029, to percent in 2032 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. At any time prior to March 15, 2029, URNA may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 6 1 / 8 percent Notes at a redemption price equal to percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be

percent of the aggregate principal amount of the 6 1 / 8 percent Notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 6 1 / 8 percent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens and (ii) mergers and consolidations, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the requirements to provide subsidiary guarantees and to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the 6 1 / 8 percent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard Poor s Ratings Services and Moody s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 6 1 / 8 percent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon. 
 
 Loan Covenants and Compliance 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and our senior notes. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. 
 The only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below percent of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of September 30, 2024, specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility. 
 Covenants in the agreements governing our ABL facility, term loan facility and certain other debt instruments impose limitations on our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments, subject to important exceptions that would allow us to make such repurchases or payments under certain conditions. Based on our current total indebtedness leverage ratio (as defined in the applicable debt agreements) and usage of the ABL facility as of September 30, 2024, we met the criteria under the applicable debt agreements for these exceptions, and as a result we were not restricted in our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated) 
 Global Economic Conditions 
 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate fluctuations and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient rental capacity for our customers. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased in recent years. For example, in March 2024, United Rentals (North America), Inc. URNA issued 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes at a 6 1 / 8 percent interest rate, while URNA's issuance in August 2021 of 750 aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes was at a 3 percent interest rate. Additionally, the weighted average interest rates on our variable debt instruments were 6.5 percent and 1.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. We have experienced and are continuing to experience inflationary pressures. A portion of inflationary cost increases is passed on to customers. The most significant cost increases that are passed on to customers are for fuel and delivery, and there are other costs for which the pass through to customers is less direct, such as repairs and maintenance, and labor. The impact of inflation and interest rate fluctuations may continue to be significant in the future. 
 We continue to assess the economic environment in which we operate and take appropriate actions to address the economic challenges we face. 
 Executive Overview 
 We are the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,666 rental locations. We primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages. These include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost OEC of 21.9 billion, and a North American branch network that operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province, and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our size also gives us greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently well-maintained and therefore more productive and reliable, and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs. 
 We offer approximately 5,000 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. Our revenues are derived from the following sources: equipment rentals, sales of rental equipment, sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues. Equipment rentals represented 85 percent of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. Our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital, and, in particular, calls for: 
 A consistently superior standard of service to customers , often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the cross-selling of the various services we offer throughout our network. We utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control , which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. Total Control is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers. Our digital capabilities, including our Total Control platform, allow our sales teams to provide contactless end-to-end customer service; 
 The further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix, with a dual objective : to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. We believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select local contractors. Our fleet team's analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns; 
 A continued focus on Lean management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement . We have a dedicated team responsible for reducing waste in our operational processes, with the objectives of: condensing the cycle time associated with preparing equipment for rent; optimizing our resources for 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 delivery and pickup of equipment; improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations; and implementing customer service best practices; 
 The continued expansion and cross-selling of adjacent specialty and services products, which enables us to provide a "one-stop" shop for our customers . We believe that the expansion of our specialty business, as exhibited by our acquisition of Yak Access, LLC, Yak Mat, LLC and New South Access Environmental Solutions, LLC (collectively, Yak in March 2024, which is discussed in note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, further positions United Rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings; and 
 The pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business, as exhibited by our acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals") in December 2022. Strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business, further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals. 
 Financial Overview 
 Prior to taking actions pertaining to our financial flexibility and liquidity, we assess our available sources and anticipated uses of cash, including, with respect to sources, cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment. In 2024, we have taken the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business: 
 Issued 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 6 1 / 8 percent Senior Notes due 2034. The issued debt, together with drawings on our ABL facility, was used to fund the Yak acquisition that is discussed in note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements; 
 Amended our term loan facility, primarily to extend the maturity date to February 2031 and to increase the facility size to 1.0 billion; and 
 Amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, primarily to extend the maturity date and to increase the facility size from 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion. The facility expires in June 2025 and may be extended on a 364-day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had available liquidity of 2.866 billion, comprised of cash and cash equivalents, and availability under the ABL and accounts receivable securitization facilities. 
 In October 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.25 billion share repurchase program, which was completed in the first quarter of 2024. In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.5 billion share repurchase program, and repurchases under this program began in March 2024, following the completion of the 1.25 billion program. We have repurchased 875 under the 1.5 billion program through September 30, 2024, and intend to repurchase a total of 1.25 billion under the program in 2024 and then complete the program by the end of the first quarter of 2025. A 1 percent excise tax is imposed on net repurchases (certain purchases minus certain issuances) of common stock. The repurchases above (as well as the total program sizes and expected 2024 repurchases) do not include the excise tax, which totaled 10 year-to-date through September 30, 2024. 
 Our Board of Directors also approved our first-ever quarterly dividend program in January 2023, and the first dividend under the program was paid in February 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid dividends of 326 4.89 per share) and 305 4.44 per share), respectively. On October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 1.63 per share, payable on November 27, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2024.

 (1) This reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations (the "major acquisitions," each of which had annual revenues of over 200 prior to acquisition). 
 (2) This reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment. 
 (3) This reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold. The decreases in 2024 primarily reflect decreased sales of rental equipment acquired in the Ahern Rentals acquisition. 
 (4) This primarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. For additional information on the restructuring charges, which generally involve the closure of a large number of branches over a short period of time, often in periods following a major acquisition, see "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-restructuring charges" below. The amounts above primarily reflect charges associated with a restructuring program initiated following the closing of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. 
 (5) This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. 
 EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, net and the impact of the fair value mark-up of the acquired fleet. See below for further detail on each adjusting item. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. 
 The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:

 (3) This reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold. The decreases in 2024 primarily reflect decreased sales of rental equipment acquired in the Ahern Rentals acquisition. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income increased 5, or 0.7 percent, and net income margin decreased 100 basis points to 17.7 percent. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased 54, or 2.9 percent, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points to 47.7 percent. 
 The year-over-year decrease in net income margin primarily reflects 1) increased selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses as a percentage of revenue, which primarily reflects the impact of certain discrete expenses and normal variability in expense timing, 2) a 430 basis point decrease in gross margin from used equipment sales, which primarily reflects the continued normalization of the used equipment market, including pricing, and 3) increased depreciation on equipment acquired in the Yak acquisition. 
 The year-over-year decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflects a 570 basis point decrease in gross margin from sales of rental equipment (excluding the adjustment reflected in the table above for the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet), which primarily reflects the continued normalization of the used equipment market, including pricing, and increased SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue as discussed above. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income increased 141, or 8.1 percent, and net income margin increased 30 basis points to 16.8 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased 212, or 4.2 percent, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 46.8 percent. 
 The year-over-year increase in net income margin primarily reflects a 50 basis point increase in gross margin from equipment rentals, primarily due to decreased depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue, and reduced restructuring charges due to 2023 charges associated with the restructuring program initiated following the December 2022 acquisition of Ahern Rentals, partially offset by a 270 basis point decrease in gross margin from used equipment sales, which primarily reflects the continued normalization of the used equipment market, including pricing. 
 The year-over-year decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflects a 580 basis point decrease in gross margin from sales of rental equipment (excluding the adjustment reflected in the table above for the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet), primarily due to the continued normalization of the used equipment market, including pricing. 
 Revenues are noted below. Fleet productivity is a comprehensive metric that provides greater insight into the decisions made by our managers in support of equipment rental growth and returns. Specifically, we seek to optimize the interplay of rental rates, time utilization and mix to drive rental revenue. Fleet productivity aggregates, in one metric, the impact of changes in rates, utilization and mix on owned equipment rental revenue. We believe that this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our decisions on rates, time utilization and mix, particularly as they support the creation of shareholder value. The table below includes the components of the year-over-year change in rental revenue using the fleet productivity methodology. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Equipment rentals 3,463 3,224 7.4 9,607 8,945 7.4 Sales of rental equipment 321 366 (12.3) 1,069 1,136 (5.9) Sales of new equipment 77 52 48.1 186 166 12.0 Contractor supplies sales 38 39 (2.6) 116 110 5.5 Service and other revenues 93 84 10.7 272 247 10.1 Total revenues 3,992 3,765 6.0 11,250 10,604 6.1 Equipment rentals variance components: Year-over-year change in average OEC 3.8 3.3 Assumed year-over-year inflation impact (1) (1.5) (1.5) Fleet productivity (2) 3.5 4.1 Contribution from ancillary and re-rent revenue (3) 1.6 1.5 Total change in equipment rentals 7.4 7.4

 (2) Reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. See note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of equipment rentals revenue. Rental rate changes are calculated based on the year-over-year variance in average contract rates, weighted by the prior period revenue mix. Time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year. Mix includes the impact of changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix. 
 (3) Reflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue (see note 2 for further detail), excluding owned equipment rental revenue. 
 Equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment, as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers: for equipment delivery and pick-up; to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent; for fuel; and for environmental and other miscellaneous costs and services. Sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment. Sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment. Contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors, which include construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. Services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers fleet (including parts sales). See note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition accounting. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues of 3.992 billion increased 6.0 percent compared with 2023. Equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types (together, they accounted for 95 percent of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024). Equipment rentals increased 239, or 7.4 percent, primarily due to a 3.5 percent increase in fleet productivity, which includes the impact of the Yak acquisition discussed above, and a 3.8 percent increase in average OEC. Sales of rental equipment decreased 45, or 12.3 percent, year-over-year, primarily due to changes in channel mix, and the continued normalization of the used equipment market, which resulted in lower pricing. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues of 11.250 billion increased 6.1 percent compared with 2023. Equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types (together, they accounted for 95 percent of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). Equipment rentals increased 662, or 7.4 percent, primarily due to a 4.1 percent increase in fleet productivity, which includes the impact of the Yak acquisition, and a 3.3 percent increase in average OEC. Sales of rental equipment did not change significantly year-over-year. 

Results of Operations 
 As discussed in note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, our reportable segments are general rentals and specialty. The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. The general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. This segment operates throughout the United States and Canada. The specialty segment rents products (and provides setup and other services on such rented equipment) including i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, ii) power and HVAC equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment, iii) fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment, transfer and treatment, iv) mobile storage equipment and modular office space and v) surface protection mats. The specialty segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment primarily operates in the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. 
 As discussed in note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we aggregate our four geographic divisions Central, Northeast, Southeast and West into our general rentals reporting segment. Historically, there have occasionally been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these divisions, though such variances have generally been small (close to or less than 10 percent, measured versus the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' divisions). For the five year period ended September 30, 2024, there was no general rentals' division with an equipment rentals gross margin that differed materially from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals' divisions. The rental industry is cyclical, and there historically have occasionally been divisions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' divisions, though the specific divisions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated, and such variances have generally not exceeded 10 percent by a significant amount. We monitor the margin variances and confirm margin similarity between divisions on a quarterly basis. 
 We believe that the divisions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics, as each division is capital intensive, offers similar products to similar customers, uses similar methods to distribute its products, and is subject to similar competitive risks. The aggregation of our divisions also reflects the management structure that we use for 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 making operating decisions and assessing performance. Although we believe aggregating these divisions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate, to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge, we may be required to disaggregate the divisions into separate reporting segments. Any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations. 
 These reporting segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources. We evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit. Our revenues, operating results, and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter.

Table of Contents 

 SG A expense primarily includes sales force compensation, information technology costs, third party professional fees, management salaries, bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead. SG A expense as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of certain discrete expenses and normal variability in expense timing. SG A expense as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was flat year-over-year. 
 The restructuring charges primarily reflect severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. We incur severance costs and branch closure charges in the ordinary course of our business. We only include such costs that are part of a restructuring program as restructuring charges. The designated restructuring programs generally involve the closure of a large number of branches over a short period of time, often in periods following a major acquisition, and result in significant costs that we would not normally incur absent a major acquisition or other triggering event that results in the initiation of a restructuring program. The year-over-year decreases in restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflect 2023 charges associated with the restructuring program initiated following the December 2022 acquisition of Ahern Rentals. Since the first such program was initiated in 2008, we have completed seven restructuring programs and have incurred total restructuring charges of 383. We currently have no open restructuring programs, and the total liability associated with our restructuring programs was 18 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Non-rental depreciation and amortization includes i) the amortization of other intangible assets and ii) depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent (such as computers and office equipment) and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements. Our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks. 
 Interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 9.2 percent and 7.8 percent year-over-year, respectively, primarily reflecting increased average debt, including the debt issued to partially fund the Yak acquisition discussed above. 
 Other (income) expense, net primarily includes i) currency gains and losses, ii) finance charges, iii) gains and losses on sales of non-rental equipment and iv) other miscellaneous items. 
 The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to the geographical mix of income between foreign and domestic operations, the impact of state and local taxes, stock compensation, and other deductible and nondeductible charges. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 additionally included the impact of the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits. 
 Balance sheet. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased by 100, or 74.1 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable which reflected required tax payments exceeding the estimated tax accruals. Goodwill increased by 913, or 15.4 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to the impact of the Yak acquisition, as discussed in note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating lease right-of-use assets increased by 156, or 14.2 percent, and operating lease liabilities increased by 126, or 14.1 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, and both increases primarily reflected increased amounts of real estate and equipment leased under operating leases. Accounts payable increased by 311, or 34.4 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to seasonal increases in capital expenditures and business activities. See the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for further information on changes in cash and cash equivalents, the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders equity for further information on changes in stockholders equity and note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on debt changes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices, which are subject to (i) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services, (ii) the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and (iii) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 In October 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.25 billion share repurchase program, which was completed in the first quarter of 2024. In January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a 1.5 billion share repurchase program, and repurchases under this program began in March 2024, following the completion of the 1.25 billion program. We have repurchased 875 under the 1.5 billion program through September 30, 2024, and intend to repurchase a total of 1.25 billion under the program in 2024 and then complete the program by the end of the first quarter of 2025. A 1 percent excise tax is imposed on net repurchases (certain purchases minus certain issuances) of common stock. The repurchases above (as well as the total program sizes and expected 2024 repurchases) do not include the excise tax, which totaled 10 year-to-date through September 30, 2024. Since 2012, we have repurchased a total of 7.100 billion (inclusive of immaterial excise taxes, which were first imposed in 2023) of Holdings' common stock under our share repurchase programs (comprised of eight programs that have ended and the current program). 
 Our Board of Directors also approved our first-ever quarterly dividend program in January 2023, and the first dividend under the program was paid in February 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid dividends totaling 326 4.89 per share) and 305 4.44 per share), respectively. On October 23, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 1.63 per share, payable on November 27, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2024. 
 Our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment, and borrowings available under our ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 479. We believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months. The table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 ABL facility: 
 Borrowing capacity, net of letters of credit 2,311 Outstanding debt, net of debt issuance costs (1) 1,915 Interest rate at September 30, 2024 6.2 Average month-end principal amount of debt outstanding (1) 1,512 Weighted-average interest rate on average debt outstanding 
 6.4 Maximum month-end principal amount of debt outstanding (1) 1,921 Accounts receivable securitization facility: Borrowing capacity 
 76 Outstanding debt, net of debt issuance costs (2) 1,423 Interest rate at September 30, 2024 5.9 Average month-end principal amount of debt outstanding (2) 1,197 Weighted-average interest rate on average debt outstanding 
 6.2 Maximum month-end principal amount of debt outstanding (2) 1,424 
 ___________________ 
 (1) The outstanding and maximum amounts of debt under the ABL facility exceeded the average outstanding amount primarily due to the use of borrowings under the facility to fund seasonal expenditures and acquisition activity. 
 (2) The outstanding and maximum amounts of debt under the accounts receivable securitization facility exceeded the average outstanding amount primarily due to normal usage of increased availability under the facility. Borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility are permitted only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool, net of applicable reserves and other deductions, exceeds the outstanding loans. The maximum amount of debt above reflects normal usage of the available borrowings based on the amount of the receivables in the collateral pool (see note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail). In May 2024, the accounts receivable securitization facility was amended, primarily to extend the maturity date and to increase the facility size from 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion, which also contributed to the difference in the average and maximum amounts outstanding.

 We expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term needs for cash relating to our operations will be to fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale, (iii) payments due under operating leases, (iv) debt service, (v) share repurchases, (vi) dividends and (vii) acquisitions. We plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash. In addition, we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate, the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit. The table below presents information on payments coming due under the most significant categories of our needs for cash (excluding operating cash flows pertaining to normal business operations, such as human capital costs, which are not accurately estimable) as of September 30, 2024: 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Debt and finance leases (1) 24 1,508 70 3,226 1,699 6,939 13,466 Interest due on debt (2) 178 669 627 545 368 845 3,232 Operating leases (1) 86 328 290 238 184 381 1,507 Purchase obligations (3) 765 337 9 1,111 Total 1,053 2,842 996 4,009 2,251 8,165 19,316 
 _________________ 
 (1) The payments due with respect to a period represent (i) in the case of debt and finance leases, the scheduled principal payments due in such period, and (ii) in the case of operating leases, the payments due in such period for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. See note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further debt information. 
 (2) Estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding advance purchase orders, which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business, with our equipment and inventory suppliers. These purchase orders can generally be cancelled by us without cancellation penalties. The equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers pursuant to these purchase orders and the related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed primarily throughout 2024 and 2025. 
 To access the capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. Credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions, including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions. As a result, negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding. Our credit ratings as of October 21, 2024 were as follows: 
 Corporate Rating Outlook Moody s Ba1 Stable Standard Poor s BB+ Stable 
 A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. There is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. 
 Loan Covenants and Compliance. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and our senior notes. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. 
 The only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of September 30, 2024, specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility. 
 Covenants in the agreements governing our ABL facility, term loan facility and certain other debt instruments impose limitations on our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments, subject to important exceptions that would allow us to make such repurchases or payments under certain conditions. Based on our current total indebtedness leverage ratio (as 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 defined in the applicable debt agreements) and usage of the ABL facility as of September 30, 2024, we met the criteria under the applicable debt agreements for these exceptions, and as a result we were not restricted in our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we (i) generated cash from operating activities of 3.498 billion, (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of 1.119 billion and (iii) received cash from debt proceeds, net of payments, of 1.765 billion. We used cash during this period principally to (i) make payments for purchases of rental and non-rental equipment and intangible assets of 3.444 billion, (ii) purchase other companies for 1.342 billion, (iii) purchase shares of our common stock for 1.168 billion and (iv) pay dividends of 326. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we (i) generated cash from operating activities of 3.290 billion, (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of 1.182 billion and (iii) received cash from debt proceeds, net of payments, of 543. We used cash during this period principally to (i) make payments for purchases of rental and non-rental equipment and intangible assets of 3.345 billion, (ii) purchase other companies for 406, (iii) purchase shares of our common stock for 806 and (iv) pay dividends of 305. 
 Free Cash Flow GAAP Reconciliation. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. The equipment and intangible asset items are included in cash flows from investing activities. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 3,498 3,290 Payments for purchases of rental equipment (3,178) (3,078) Payments for purchases of non-rental equipment and intangible assets (266) (267) Proceeds from sales of rental equipment 1,069 1,136 Proceeds from sales of non-rental equipment 50 46 Insurance proceeds from damaged equipment 38 30 Free cash flow 1,211 1,157 
 Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not change significantly year-over-year. 
 Relationship between Holdings and URNA. Holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, URNA, and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to URNA in connection with its operations. These services principally include: (i) senior management services; (ii) finance and tax-related services and support; (iii) information technology systems and support; (iv) acquisition-related services; (v) legal services; and (vi) human resource support. In addition, Holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by URNA and its subsidiaries. 
 Information Regarding Guarantors of URNA Indebtedness 
 URNA is 100 percent owned by Holdings and has certain outstanding indebtedness that is guaranteed by both Holdings and, with the exception of its U.S. special purpose vehicle which holds receivable assets relating to the Company s accounts receivable securitization facility (the SPV and a foreign subsidiary holding company acquired in connection with the General Finance acquisition, all of URNA s U.S. subsidiaries (the guarantor subsidiaries ). Other than the guarantee by our Canadian subsidiary of URNA's indebtedness under the ABL facility, none of URNA s indebtedness is guaranteed by URNA's foreign subsidiaries, the SPV, or the foreign subsidiary holding company acquired in connection with the General Finance acquisition (together, the non-guarantor subsidiaries ). The receivable assets owned by the SPV have been sold or contributed by URNA to the SPV and are not available to satisfy the obligations of URNA or Holdings other subsidiaries. Holdings consolidates each of URNA and the guarantor subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. URNA and the guarantor subsidiaries are all 100 percent-owned and controlled by Holdings. Holdings guarantees of URNA s indebtedness are full and unconditional, except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met. The Holdings guarantees are also subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by Holdings will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 The guarantees of Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries are made on a joint and several basis. The guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are not full and unconditional because a guarantor subsidiary can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances, including sale of the guarantor subsidiary, the sale of all or substantially all of the guarantor subsidiary's assets, the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met, designating the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the applicable covenants or the notes being rated investment grade by both Standard Poor s Ratings Services and Moody s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA. Like the Holdings guarantees, the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws. 
 All of the existing guarantees by Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness. The secured indebtedness of Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries (including guarantees of URNA s existing and future secured indebtedness) will rank effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors. The guarantees of URNA s indebtedness are effectively junior to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors, including our foreign subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the indebtedness of our non-guarantors was comprised of (i) 1.423 billion of outstanding borrowings by the SPV in connection with the Company s accounts receivable securitization facility, (ii) 121 of outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility by non-guarantor subsidiaries and (iii) 12 of finance leases of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. 
 Covenants in the agreements governing our ABL facility, term loan facility and certain other debt instruments impose limitations on our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments, subject to important exceptions that would allow us to make such repurchases or payments under certain conditions. Based on our current total indebtedness leverage ratio (as defined in the applicable debt agreements) and usage of the ABL facility as of September 30, 2024, we met the criteria under the applicable debt agreements for these exceptions, and as a result we were not restricted in our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments. 
 Based on our understanding of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X ("Rule 3-10"), we believe that Holdings guarantees of URNA indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in Rule 3-10, which enables us to present summarized financial information for Holdings, URNA and the consolidated guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. The summarized financial information excludes the financial information of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. In accordance with Rule 3-10, separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented. Our presentation below excludes the investment in the non-guarantor subsidiaries and the related income from the non-guarantor subsidiaries. 
 The summarized financial information of Holdings, URNA and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis is as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 Current receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries 2 Other current assets 498 Total current assets 500 Long-term assets 22,715 Total assets 23,215 Current liabilities 2,342 Long-term liabilities 15,380 Total liabilities 17,722 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Total revenues 10,261 Gross profit 4,151 Net income 1,690

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (dollars in millions, unless otherwise indicated) 
 Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of (i) interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and (ii) foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations. 
 Interest Rate Risk. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 4.3 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, comprised of borrowings under the ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities. The amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under these facilities may fluctuate significantly. See note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the amounts outstanding, and the interest rates thereon, as of September 30, 2024 under these facilities. As of September 30, 2024, based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding, our annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately 32 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 9.1 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates. A one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of September 30, 2024 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately 3 percent. For additional information concerning the fair value of our fixed rate debt, see note 6 (see Fair Value of Financial Instruments to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Currency Exchange Risk . We primarily operate in the U.S. and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries accounted for 987, or 9 percent, of our total revenue of 11.250 billion, and 178, or 7 percent, of our total pretax income of 2.479 billion. Based on the size of our foreign operations relative to the Company as a whole, we do not believe that a 10 percent change in exchange rates would have a material impact on our earnings. We do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures
