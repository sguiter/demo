of the equity interest in Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited, an exempted entity incorporated on April 23, 2013 under the laws of the

the Cayman Islands Insurance Law. The Company also indirectly owns 
of the equity interest in Oxbridge Re NS, an entity incorporated as an exempted company on December 22, 2017 under the laws of the
Cayman Islands to function as a reinsurance sidecar facility and to increase the underwriting capacity of Oxbridge Reinsurance
Limited. The Company also indirectly owns 
of the equity interest in SurancePlus Inc. SurancePlus ), an entity incorporated as a business company on December 19,
2022 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands to issue digital securities. The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively
 Oxbridge Re businesses are as follows: SurancePlus is a Web3-focused subsidiary that currently leverages blockchain
technology to democratize access to high-return reinsurance contracts via digital securities; Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited is a
licensed reinsurance subsidiary that provides reinsurance business solutions primarily to property and casualty insurers in the Gulf

The
Company s ordinary shares and warrants are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols OXBR and OXBRW, 
respectively. 

(b) 
 Basis
 of Presentation and Consolidation 

The
accompanying unaudited, consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC rules for interim financial reporting. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations . However, in the opinion of management, the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements
reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position as of September
30, 2024 and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for
any subsequent interim period or for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company s Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 26,
2024 . 

Uses
of Estimates : In preparing the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements, management was required to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at the financial
reporting date and throughout the periods being reported upon. Certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective
and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates, which would be reflected in future periods. 

Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the reserve for losses
and loss adjustment expenses (if any), which may include amounts estimated for claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company uses
various assumptions and actuarial data it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates. In addition, accounting
policies specific to valuation of investments involve significant judgments and estimates material to the Company s consolidated
financial statements. Although considerable variability is likely to be inherent in these estimates, management believes that the amounts
provided are reasonable. These estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted if necessary. Such adjustments are reflected in current
operations. 

The
Company consolidates in these consolidated financial statements the results of operations and financial position of all voting interest
entities VOE in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and all variable interest entities VIE in which the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary. The consolidation assessment, including the determination as to whether
an entity qualifies as a VIE or VOE, depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding each entity. 

All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Fair
value measurement (cont d) 

Inputs
are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation
decisions, including assumptions about risk. For fixed maturity debt securities, inputs may include price information, volatility statistics,
specific and broad credit data, liquidity statistics, broker quotes for similar securities and other factors. The fair value of investments
in stocks and exchange-traded funds is based on the last traded price. A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy
is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes
 observable requires significant judgment by the Company s investment custodians and management. The investment custodians
consider observable data to be market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not
proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant markets.

On
August 7, 2023, OXAC held an extraordinary general meeting at which the business combination with Jet Token, Inc. was approved by OXAC
shareholders. In conjunction with the business combination, OXAC was redomesticated as a Delaware entity, and changed its name to Jet.AI
Inc. The business combination was closed on August 10, 2023, and on August 11, 2023, OXAC common stock and warrants began trading on
the Nasdaq Global Market under the new ticker symbols JTAI and JTAIW. 

The
Company s beneficial interests in Jet. AI s common stock, public warrants and Series A-1 Preferred Shares are recorded at
fair value and are classified in Other Investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value calculation of the
Company s beneficial interest in Jet.AI s common stock and public warrants is dependent on the observable trading prices
of JetAI s common stock and public warrants. The fair value calculation of the Company s beneficial interest in the Series
A-1 Preferred Share is estimated to be the pro-rata original principal amount of the Preferred Share due to the short-term nature. 

The
Sponsor holds Series A-1 preferred shares with purchase price of each, and previously held 
 ordinary shares along
with 
 warrants. One of the
Company s executive officers is an independent member of Jet.AI s board. The Company s wholly-owned licensed reinsurance subsidiary, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited Oxbridge Reinsurance ), was
the lead investor in the Sponsor and at June 30, 2024, held the equivalent of of Jet.AI Inc s common stock (NASDAQ: JTAI)
and of Jet.AI Inc s warrants (NASDAQ: JTAIW). On July 29, 2024, the Company s warrants were converted
into of Jet.AI s common stock in accordance with Jet.AI s Tender Offer Statement (as amended) as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on July 23, 2024. In August 2024, upon the anniversary of Jet.AI s business combination, the ordinary shares
held by the Sponsor became unrestricted and was distributed pro-rata to the Sponsor s investors. At September 30, 2024, the Company
held of Jet.AI common stock. 

As
a result of the re-measurement of our investment in Jet.AI, we recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an unrealized
loss of within our consolidated statements of operations.

When
losses occur, the reserves for losses and LAE are typically comprised of case reserves (which are based on claims that have been reported)
and IBNR reserves (which are based on losses that are believed to have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported and include
a provision for expected future development on existing case reserves). The Company typically suffers limit losses in the event of a
Category 3 or above hurricane making landfall in a populated area where the Company has catastrophe risk exposure. For the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded it s reserves for losses and LAE based on the contractual maximum
loss the Company can suffer under the affected contracts. 

The
uncertainties inherent in the reserving process and potential delays by cedants and brokers in the reporting of loss information,
together with the potential for unforeseen adverse developments, may result in the reserve for losses and LAE ultimately being
significantly greater or less than the reserve provided at the end of any given reporting period. The degree of uncertainty is
further increased when a significant loss event takes place near the end of a reporting period. Reserve for losses and LAE estimates are
reviewed periodically on a contract-by-contract basis and updated as new information becomes known. Any resulting adjustments are
reflected in income in the period in which they become known. 

The
Company s reserving process is highly dependent on the timing of loss information received from its cedants and related brokers. 

There
were no losses incurred during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

forward-looking statements is included in the section entitled Risk Factors contained in our Form

update or revise any forward -looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on the forward -looking statements which speak only to the dates on which they were made. 

GENERAL 

The
following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023 and our financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Form
10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 26, 2024 . References to we, 
 us, our, our company, or the Company refer to Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited and
its subsidiaries, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited, SurancePlus Holdings Ltd., SurancePlus Inc. and Oxbridge Re NS, unless the context dictates otherwise. 

Overview
and Trends 

We
are a Cayman Islands specialty property and casualty reinsurer that provides reinsurance solutions through our reinsurance subsidiaries,
Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited and Oxbridge Re NS. We focus on underwriting fully collateralized reinsurance contracts primarily for property
and casualty insurance companies in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, with an emphasis on Florida. We specialize in underwriting
medium frequency, high severity risks, where we believe sufficient data exists to analyze effectively the risk/return profile of reinsurance
contracts. Oxbridge Re NS functions as a reinsurance sidecar which increases the underwriting capacity of Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited.
Oxbridge Re NS issues participating notes to third party investors, the proceeds of which are utilized to collateralize Oxbridge Reinsurance
Limited s reinsurance obligations. 

In
addition to our historical reinsurance business operations, in 2023, our new subsidiary SurancePlus developing, offering, and selling
a tokenized reinsurance security representing fractionalized interests in reinsurance contracts, with each token representing an interest
in participating notes issued by Oxbridge Re NS. These efforts culminated in the development, launch, and issuance of our first tokenized
reinsurance security, the DeltaCat Re Token, which we believe is the first on-chain reinsurance security of its kind to
be developed by a subsidiary of a public company. Following the issuance of the DeltaCat Re Token, we intend to develop, launch, and
issue additional series of tokenized reinsurance securities representing fractional interests in reinsurance contracts, and we are also
using our tokenization experience and activities as a foundation for developing Web3-focused business offerings and products relating
to the tokenization of other real-world assets (RWAs), including RWAs held or being acquired by third parties. Our tokenization business
will be conducted through SurancePlus and through other subsidiaries of our 80 owned subsidiary, SurancePlus Holdings Ltd. SurancePlus
Holdings ), a Cayman Islands exempted company that we have organized to serve as a holding company for subsidiaries that will
operate our developing Web3-focused business operations. 

25 

In
our historical reinsurance business operations, we underwrite reinsurance contracts on a selective and opportunistic basis as opportunities
arise based on our goal of achieving favorable long-term returns on equity for our shareholders. Our goal is to achieve long-term growth
in book value per share by writing business that generates attractive underwriting profits relative to the risk we bear. Additionally,
we intend to complement our underwriting profits with investment profits on an opportunistic basis. Our underwriting business focus is
on fully collateralized reinsurance contracts for property catastrophes, primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Within
that market and risk category, we attempt to select the most economically attractive opportunities across a variety of property and casualty
insurers. As we attempt to grow our capital base, we expect that we will consider further growth opportunities in other geographic areas
and risk categories. 

Our
level of profitability is primarily determined by how adequately our premiums assumed and investment income cover our costs and expenses,
which consist primarily of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses, claim payments and general and administrative expenses.
One factor leading to variation in our operational results is the timing and magnitude of any follow-on offerings we undertake (if any),
as we are able to deploy new capital to collateralize new reinsurance treaties and consequently, earn additional premium revenue. In
addition, our results of operations may be seasonal in that hurricanes and other tropical storms typically occur during the period from
June 1 through November 30. Further, our results of operations may be subject to significant variations due to factors affecting the
property and casualty insurance industry in general, which include competition, legislation, regulation, general economic conditions,
judicial trends, and fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment. 

Because
we employ an opportunistic underwriting and investment philosophy, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be
meaningful. In addition, our historical investment results may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. Due to the nature
of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period. 

Compared
to most of our competitors, we are small and have low overhead expenses. We believe that our expense efficiency, agility and existing
relationships support our competitive position and allows us to profitably participate in lines of business that fit within our strategy.
Over time we expect our expense advantage to erode as the industry acts to reduce frictional costs. 

Recent
Developments 

Formation
of SurancePlus 

SurancePlus,
an indirect 80 owned subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated as a British Virgin Islands Business Company on December 19, 2022
for the purpose of tokenizing reinsurance contracts underwritten by its affiliated licensed reinsurer, Oxbridge Re NS. 

On
March 27, 2023, we, through SurancePlus, issued a press release announcing the commencement of an offering by SurancePlus of up to 5.0

Preferred Shares per DeltaCat Re Token (the Private Placement ). 

On
June 27, 2023, SurancePlus completed the Private Placement. The aggregate amount raised in the Private Placement was 2,447,760 for the
issuance of 244,776 DeltaCat Re Tokens, of which approximately 1,280,000 was received from third-party investors and approximately 1,167,000
was received from Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited.

At the offering s commencement, up to one million (1,000,000) Participation Shares will be issued, represented by digital

initial price of 10.00 per Participation Share. 

26 

The
net proceeds from the offer and sale of the Participation Shares were used by SurancePlus to purchase a participating note
of Oxbridge Re NS, an affiliated Cayman Islands licensed reinsurance entity, and the proceeds from the sale of such participating note
were invested in collateralized reinsurance contracts to be underwritten by Oxbridge Re NS. The holders of the Participation Shares
will generally be entitled to proceeds from the payment of the participating notes in the amount of a preferred return equal to the initial
Participation Share price, plus 20 , and then 80 of any proceeds in excess of the amount necessary to pay the preferred return. 

On
July 12, 2024, SurancePlus completed the Private Placement. The aggregate amount raised in the Private Placement was 2,878,078 Participation
Shares (the Securities represented by digital tokens issued under a 3-year Participation Share Investment Contract (for

to September 30, 2024, and through the date of issuance of these financial statements, we sold an additional 75,703 ordinary shares under
the ATM program for gross proceeds of 199,390, at an average price 2.63 per share. After deducting commissions related to the ATM offering
of 5,982, the net proceeds we received from the transactions were 193,408. The proceeds from the ATM sales are being used for working
capital and other general corporate purposes. 

PRINCIPAL
REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS 

Revenues 

We
derive our most significant revenues from three principal sources: 

premiums
 assumed from reinsurance on property and casualty business; 

income
 from investments and unrealized (loss) gain on other investments; 

income
 from SurancePlus management fees. 

Premiums
Assumed 

Premiums
assumed include all premiums received by a reinsurance company during a specified accounting period, even if the policy provides coverage
beyond the end of the period. Premiums are earned over the term of the related policies. At the end of each accounting period, the portion
of the premiums that are not yet earned are included in the unearned premiums reserve and are realized as revenue in subsequent periods
over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of twelve months. Thus, for example, for a policy that is written
on July 1, 2024, typically one-half of the premiums will be earned in 2024 and the other half will be earned during 2025. However, in
the event of limit losses on our policies, premium recognition will be accelerated to match losses incurred in the period, when there
is no possibility of any future treaty-year losses under the contracts. 

Premiums
from reinsurance on property and casualty business assumed are directly related to the number, type and pricing of contracts we write. 

Premiums
assumed are recorded net of change in loss experience refund, which consists of changes in amounts due to the cedants under two of our
reinsurance contracts. These contracts contain retrospective provisions that adjust premiums in the event losses are minimal or zero.
We recognize a liability pro-rata over the period in which the absence of loss experience obligates us to refund premiums under the contracts,
and we will derecognize such liability in the period in which a loss experience arises. The change in loss experience refund is negatively
correlated to loss and loss adjustment expenses described below. 

28 

Investment
Income 

Income
from our investments is primarily comprised of net realized and unrealized (losses) gains interest income and dividends on investment
securities. Such income is primarily from the Company s investments, which includes other investments in Jet.AI and investments
held in trust accounts that collateralize the reinsurance policies that we write. The investment parameters for trust accounts are generally
be established by the cedant for the relevant policy. 

Incentive,
Technology, Origination and Management Fee Income 

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company s subsidiary, SurancePlus Inc., entered into subscriptions agreements
for the sale of its participation Shares represented by the digital, representing fractionalized interest in reinsurance contracts underwritten
by Oxbridge Re NS. The tokens were issued on the Avalanche blockchain. 

SurancePlus
receives an incentive and management fee to cover costs associated with origination, structuring and the blockchain technology related
to the tokens. These fees are included in SurancePlus management fee line item in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Expenses 

Our
expenses consist primarily of the following: 

losses
 and loss adjustment expenses; 

policy
 acquisition costs and underwriting expenses; and 

general
 and administrative expenses. 

Loss
and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

Loss
and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the
underlying coverage. As described below, loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on the claims reported by our Company s ceding
insurers, and may include an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates
from prior periods. Depending on the nature of the contract, loss and loss adjustment expenses may be paid over a period of years. 

Policy
Acquisition Costs and Underwriting Expenses 

Policy
acquisition costs and underwriting expenses consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes and other direct expenses
that relate to our writing of reinsurance contracts. We amortize deferred acquisition costs over the related contract term. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits and related costs, including costs associated with our professional fees,
rent and other general operating expenses consistent with operating as a public company.

General .
Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 540,000, or 0.09) basic and diluted earnings per share compared to a net
loss of 7.3 million, or 1.24) basic and diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily
due to the decrease in the negative change in the fair value of equity securities and investments during the quarter ended September
30, 2024 when compared with the prior period. 

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.27 million or 0.37) per basic or diluted loss per share compared to a net
loss of 7.24 million, or 1.23) per basic and diluted loss per share, for the nine months ended September 2023. The decrease in
net loss was primarily the result of the decrease in the change of fair value of equity securities and investments during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the prior period. 

Premium
Income . Net premiums earned typically reflects the pro rata inclusion into income of premiums assumed over the life of the reinsurance
contracts. 

Net
premiums earned for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to 595,000 from 549,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
The increase is due to the contracts in force in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
premiums earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 1.7 million from 732,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase is due to the reinsurance contracts in force during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the
prior period. 

30 

Losses
Incurred . There were no losses incurred during the nine-month periods ending September 30,
2024 and 2023. 

Policy
Acquisition Costs and Underwriting Expenses . Acquisition costs represent the amortization of the brokerage fees and federal excise
taxes incurred on reinsurance contracts placed. Policy acquisition costs and underwriting expenses for the quarter ended September 30,
2024 increased to 66,000 from 60,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to the contracts in force in the
quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Policy
acquisition costs and underwriting expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 188,000 from 80,000 for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 432,000,
from 628,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to the decrease in offering costs associated with SurancePlus
being recognized during the three-month period ending September 30, 2024 when compared with the same period last year. 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 1.5 million, from 1.7 million, for the
quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in offering costs
associated with SurancePlus being recognized during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior
period. 

MEASUREMENT
OF RESULTS 

We
use various measures to analyze the growth and profitability of business operations. For our reinsurance business, we measure growth
in terms of premiums assumed and we measure underwriting profitability by examining our loss, underwriting expense and combined ratios.
We analyze and measure profitability in terms of net income and return on average equity. 

Premiums
Assumed. We use gross premiums assumed to measure our sales of reinsurance products. Gross premiums assumed also correlate to
our ability to generate net premiums earned. 

Loss
Ratio. The loss ratio is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and measures the
underwriting profitability of our reinsurance business. The loss ratio remained consistent at 0 for the quarter and nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, compared with the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Acquisition
Cost Ratio. The acquisition cost ratio is the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums
earned. The acquisition cost ratio measures our operational efficiency in producing, underwriting and administering our reinsurance business. 

The
acquisition cost ratio increased marginally to 11.1 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 11.0 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024,
from 10.9 for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily to premiums being earned during
the periods ending September 30, 2024, when compared with the prior periods. 

Expense
Ratio. The expense ratio is the ratio of policy acquisition costs, other underwriting expenses and general and administrative
expenses to net premiums earned. We use the expense ratio to measure our operating performance. The expense ratio decreased from 125.3 
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 83.7 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due
to the higher levels of premium earned and lower general administrative expenses incurred during the three-month period ended September
30, 2024, when compared with the prior period. 

The
expense ratio decreased from 244.3 for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023, to 98.0 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024. The decrease is due to the higher levels of premium earned and lower general administrative expenses incurred during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the prior period. 

Combined
Ratio. We use the combined ratio to measure our underwriting performance. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and
the expense ratio. The combined ratio decreased from 125.3 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 83.7 for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to the higher levels of premium earned and lower general administrative expenses
incurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the prior period. 

The
combined ratio decreased from 244.3 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 98.0 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024. The decrease is due to the higher levels of premium earned and lower general administrative expenses incurred during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, when compared with the prior period

FINANCIAL
CONDITION SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2023 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents . As of September 30, 2024, our restricted cash and cash
equivalents increased by 1.1 million, or 28.9 , to 4.8 million, from 3.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase is the
result of premium deposits made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Investments .
 As of September 30, 2024, our total investments decreased by 495,000 to 185,000, from 680,000 as of December 31, 2023.
The decrease is primarily a result of the sale of two of the equity securities and the decrease in value of the equity securities during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Other
investments . As of September, 30, 2024, our other investments decreased 1.94 million to 541,000 from 2.48 million at
December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to fair value changes of our investment in Jet.AI in which the Company has an equity investment
measured at fair value. 

Notes
Payable to Noteholders. As of September 30, 2024, our notes payable remained stable at 118,000. 

Other
liabilities Delta Cat Re Tokenholders. As of September 30, 2024, amounts due to Epsilon Cat Re tokenholders
decreased by 38,000 to 1.48 million from 1.52 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to returns made to investors
who invested in Delta Cat Re tokens outweighing the proceeds from third-party investors purchasing the Epsilon Cat Re participation
shares represented by digital tokens (net of management fees), plus four month underwriting-relating income that is attributable to
third-party tokenholders. 

Unearned
Premium Reserve. As of September 30, 2024, our unearned premium reserve increased by 671,000 to 1,586,000 from 915,000 at
December 31, 2023. The increase is due to reinsurance contracts placed for the 2024 2025 treaty year.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

General 

We
are organized as a holding company and provide administrative and management services to our subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted
through our reinsurance subsidiaries, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited and Oxbridge Re NS and our web3 focused subsidiary SurancePlus Inc.
which underwrites risks associated with our property and casualty reinsurance programs as well as the tokenization of RWAs such as Reinsurance
contracts. We have minimal continuing cash needs at the holding company level, with such needs principally being related to the payment
of administrative expenses and shareholder dividends. There are restrictions on Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited s and Oxbridge Re
NS ability to pay dividends which are described in more detail below. 

Sources
and Uses of Funds 

Our
sources of funds primarily consist of premium receipts (net of brokerage fees and federal excise taxes, where applicable) and investment
income, including interest, dividends and realized gains. We use cash to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, other underwriting
expenses, dividends, and general and administrative expenses. Substantially all our surplus funds, net of funds required for cash liquidity
purposes, are invested in accordance with our business plan and investment guidelines. Our investment portfolio, except for our investment
in Jet.AI, is primarily comprised of cash and highly liquid securities, which can be liquidated, if necessary, to meet current liabilities.
We believe that we have sufficient flexibility to liquidate any securities that we own to generate liquidity. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we believe we had sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our liquidity requirements. We expect that our
operational needs for liquidity will be met by cash, investment income and funds generated from underwriting activities. We have no plans
to issue debt, and we expect to fund our operations for the foreseeable future from operating cash flows, as well as from potential future
equity offerings. However, we cannot provide assurances that in the future we will not incur indebtedness to implement our business strategy,
pay claims or make acquisitions. 

Although
Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, its subsidiaries Oxbridge
Reinsurance Limited and Oxbridge Re NS are subject to Cayman Islands regulatory constraints that affect its ability to pay dividends
to us and include a minimum net worth requirement. Currently, the minimum net worth requirement for each subsidiary is 500. As of September
30, 2024, each subsidiary exceeded the minimum required. By law, each subsidiary is restricted from paying a dividend if such a dividend
would cause its net worth to drop to less than the required minimum. 

Cash
Flows 

Our
cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized
below. 

Cash
Flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands) 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1,248 which consisted primarily of cash
received net written premiums less cash disbursed for operating expenses. Net cash provided by investing activities of 448 which
was due to the repayment of the note receivable by Jet.AI and the proceeds from the sale of two of our equity securities. Net cash
provided by financing activities was 1,876 which consisted primarily of net proceeds from Epsilon Cat Re participation shares
represented by digital tokens offset by the payments made to DeltaCat Re tokenholders. 

Cash
Flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands) 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 1,356, which consisted primarily of cash received
net written premiums less cash disbursed for operating expenses. Net cash used in investing activities of 105 which was due mainly to
investment in note receivable from Jet.AI Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,182 which consisted primarily of net proceeds
from Delta Cat Re Tokens offset by the payment made to noteholders. 

33 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Exposure
to Catastrophes 

As
with other reinsurers, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural
and man-made disasters, such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, fires, riots and explosions. Although we attempt to limit
our exposure to levels, we believe are acceptable, it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As described under CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses below, under accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America GAAP ), we are not permitted to establish loss reserves with respect to losses
that may be incurred under reinsurance contracts until the occurrence of an event which may give rise to a claim. As a result, only loss
reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be established, with no provision for a contingency reserve to account
for expected future losses. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

We
are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements
and related footnotes. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions,
industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These accounting policies pertain to
fair value measurements, particular with respect to our beneficial interest in Jet.AI., premium revenues and risk transfer, reserve for
loss and loss adjustment expenses, and deferred acquisition costs. 

Fair
value measurement : GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). 

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy under GAAP are as follows: 

Level
1 Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date 

Level
2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets
that are not considered to be active 

and 

Level
3 Inputs that are unobservable. 

Inputs
are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation
decisions, including assumptions about risk. For fixed maturity securities, inputs may include price information, volatility statistics,
specific and broad credit data, liquidity statistics, broker quotes for similar securities and other factors. The fair value of investments
in stocks and exchange-traded funds is based on the last traded price. The fair value of our indirect investment in Jet.AI is based on
the last traded price in an actively traded market. A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes observable 
requires significant judgment by the Company s investment custodians and management. The investment custodians and management consider
observable data to be market data, which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary,
and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant markets. The categorization of a financial instrument
within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument, as well as the marketability of the instrument and the
risk of forfeiture of such instrument. 

34 

Premium
Revenue and Risk Transfer . We record premiums revenue as earned pro-rata over the terms of the reinsurance agreements and the
unearned portion at the balance sheet date is recorded as unearned premiums reserve. A reserve is made for estimated premium deficiencies
to the extent that estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses exceed related unearned premiums. Investment income is not considered
in determining whether or not a deficiency exists. 

We
account for reinsurance contracts in accordance with ASC 944, Financial Services Insurance. Assessing whether
or not a reinsurance contract meets the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical
to reporting premiums written. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we must account for the
contract as a deposit liability. 

Reserves
for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses . We determine our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on the basis of the
claims reported by our ceding insurers and for losses IBNR, we use the assistance of an independent actuary. The reserves for losses
and loss adjustment expenses represent management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement costs of all losses and loss adjustment
expenses. 

We
believe that the amounts are adequate; however, the inherent impossibility of predicting future events with precision, results in uncertainty
as to the amount which will ultimately be required for the settlement of losses and loss expenses, and the differences could be material.
Adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which they are determined. 

Under
GAAP, we are not permitted to establish loss reserves until the occurrence of an actual loss event. As a result, only loss reserves applicable
to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be recorded, with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account
for expected future losses. Losses arising from future events, which could be substantial, are estimated and recognized at the time the
loss is incurred. 

As
at September 30, 2024 we had no reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses due to no significant events occurring during the year
and no reported claims on contract in force. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Our
reserving methodology does not lend itself well to a statistical calculation of a range of estimates surrounding the best point estimate
of our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expense. Due to the low frequency and high severity nature of claims within much of our business,
our reserving methodology principally involves arriving at a specific point estimate for the ultimate expected loss on a contract-by-contract
basis, and our aggregate loss reserves are the sum of the individual loss reserves established. 

Deferred
Acquisition Costs. We defer certain expenses that are directly related to and vary with producing reinsurance business, including
brokerage fees on gross premiums assumed, premium taxes and certain other costs related to the acquisition of reinsurance contracts.
These costs are capitalized and the resulting asset, deferred acquisition costs, is amortized and charged to expense in future periods
as premiums assumed are earned. The method followed in computing deferred acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferral to its
estimated realizable value. The ultimate recoverability of deferred acquisition costs is dependent on the continued profitability of
our reinsurance underwriting. If our underwriting ceases to be profitable, we may have to write off a portion of our deferred acquisition
costs, resulting in a further charge to income in the period in which the underwriting losses are recognized.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently involved in any litigation or arbitration. We anticipate that, similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance
industry, we will be subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes to our risk factors during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, we draw attention to the
below risk factors relating to our investment in Jet.AI Inc. that can have a material impact on our earnings and shareholders 
equity in the near term. 

Our
use of fair value accounting of our significant investment in Jet.AI Inc. could result in income statement volatility, which in turn,
could cause significant market price and trading volume fluctuations for our securities. 

Our
significant beneficial interests in Jet.AI Inc. s common stock are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
value being recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during the period of change. Additionally, the fair value of the investment
must be remeasured quarterly. Because of this, and due to significance of our investment in Jet.AI relative to our total assets, our
earnings may experience greater volatility in the future as a decline in the fair value of our investment in Jet.AI Inc. could significantly
reduce both our earnings and shareholders equity, which in turn, could cause significant market price and trading volume fluctuations
for our securities. 

Item 
 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

On
September 30, 2022, we entered into an at the market (ATM) sales agreement with Maxim Group LLC as our sales agent, under
which we may offer and sell from time to time up to 6.3 million of ordinary shares in negotiated transactions or transactions that
are deemed to be an ATM offering. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 113,977 ordinary shares under the ATM program for gross proceeds of 342,525 at an
average price of 3.00 per share. After deducting commissions related to the ATM offering of 10,275, the net proceeds we received from
the transactions were 332,250. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 143,895 ordinary shares under the ATM program for gross proceeds of 419,663
at an average price of 2.92 per share. After deducting commissions related to the ATM offering of 12,590, the net proceeds we received
from the transactions were 407,073. The proceeds from the ATM sales are being used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
