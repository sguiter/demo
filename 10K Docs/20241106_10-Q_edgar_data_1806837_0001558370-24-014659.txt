The Company believes that Level 2 designation is appropriate for Commercial Paper and U.S. Treasury Securities under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , as these securities are fixed income securities, none are exchange-traded and all are priced by correlation to observed market data. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, U.S. government and agency yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the security s terms and conditions, among other factors. In connection with the August 2024 ecosio acquisition, the sellers are entitled to annual Earn-outs based on ecosio s achievement of certain monthly software revenue targets measured over an aggregate of 12 months and paid within 90 days after the relevant measurement period. The fair value of the Cash Earn-out and the Stock Earn-out were measured on the Acquisition Date using a Monte Carlo simulation in a risk-neutral framework, calibrated to management s revenue forecasts. Additional information on the Cash Earn-out and the Stock Earn-out is presented in the following table:

In the event that actual software revenues exceed 100 of the target, additional payments may be made up to a maximum of of the annual target. If actual software revenues are below 85 of the target, payouts are made for that measurement period. The Stock Earn-outs are paid in shares of the Company s Class A common stock. These Earn-outs represent recurring fair value measurements with significant unobservable inputs, which management considers to be Level 3 measurements under the fair value hierarchy. The final payments may be adjusted depending on the actual amount, above or below the target. Both the Cash Earn-out and the Stock Earn-out are recorded at fair value and are included in purchase commitment and contingent consideration liabilities, net of current portion in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Assets and Liabilities for Which Fair Value is Only Disclosed The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and the carrying amount of funds held for customers were the same as their respective fair values and are considered Level 1 measurements. The carrying amount of our bank debt approximates fair value as the variable rates on the debt approximate those commercially available in the market, and is considered a Level 3 measurement. Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements The ecosio acquisition on August 30, 2024, the Tellutax acquisition on January 25, 2021 and the Systax acquisition on January 10, 2020 were accounted for as business combinations, and the total purchase price for each acquisition was allocated to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The Company had a contractual commitment to acquire the remaining equity interest from the original Systax Quotaholders incrementally through 2024. Purchase commitment payments for these incremental acquisition amounts were based on a multiple of Systax revenue and earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization, and income taxes EBITDA performance at the end of 2023 and 2022. Management determined these future purchase commitments to be a forward contract, resulting in the Company being required to estimate and record an estimated future purchase commitment amount (the Purchase Commitment Liability in connection with recording the initial purchase. The fair value of the Purchase Commitment Liability at the acquisition date was finalized to be . This amount has fluctuated as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and is reflected in purchase commitment and contingent consideration liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with such changes in exchange rates being reflected in other comprehensive loss or income in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Adjustments to the settlement date value that arose as a result of remeasurement at future balance sheet dates were recorded as interest expense related to financing costs in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in the period the change is identified. A final adjustment for to interest expense was recorded during the second quarter of 2024. such adjustments were recorded for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company paid , to acquire the remaining equity interest of Systax, which increased the Company s ownership percentage of Systax to , and settled the outstanding Purchase Commitment Liability. The Purchase Commitment Liability included in purchase commitment and contingent consideration liabilities, current in the condensed consolidated balance sheet on December 31, 2023 was . The carrying amount of the Purchase Commitment Liability approximated its respective fair value at December 31, 2023 and is considered a Level 3 non-recurring fair value measurement. Derivative Instruments The Company may periodically enter into derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, the Company has not designated derivative contracts as hedges. Such derivative contracts are typically designed to manage specific risks according to our strategies, which may change from time to time. The Company entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the Brazilian Real associated with a portion of the Purchase Commitment Liability. Such forward contracts have not been designated as a hedge, do not qualify for hedge accounting and are not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. During the second quarter of 2024, the forward currency contracts matured as the Company settled the outstanding Purchase Commitment Liability. These forward contacts are remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in other assets in our December 31, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheet with changes in their estimated fair value recognized as interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of

The Notes issued on April 26, 2024 include an additional aggregate principal amount of Notes, issued pursuant to the full exercise by the initial purchasers of the Notes of their option to purchase additional Notes. The Notes are the senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and are (i) ranked equal in right of payment with the Company s senior unsecured indebtedness, (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes, (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company s senior secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness, and (iv) structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company s subsidiaries. The Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum on the principal amount thereof, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2024. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2029 (the maturity date ), unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. On November 1, 2028, and thereafter, holders may convert their Notes anytime at their election, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date.

If the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date, even if the Notes are not otherwise convertible at such time. If specified distributions to holders of the Company s common stock are made or specified corporate events occur. 
 If a holder converts upon a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) or Company redemption, the holder may be eligible to receive a make-whole premium through an increase to the conversion rate. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock at the Company s election. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is shares of Class A common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of Class A common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the Indenture.

On-premise subscriptions are typically sold through one-year contracts, and cloud-based subscriptions are typically sold through one- to three-year contracts. We bill the majority of our customers annually in advance of the subscription period. Our customers include a majority of the Fortune 500, as well as a majority of the top 10 companies by revenue in multiple industries such as retail, technology, and manufacturing, in addition to leading marketplaces. As our customers expand geographically and pursue omnichannel business models, their tax determination and compliance requirements increase and become more complex, providing sustainable organic growth opportunities for our business. Our flexible, tiered transaction-based pricing model also results in our customers growing their spend with us as they grow and continue to use our solutions. We principally price our solutions based on a customer s revenue base, in addition to a number of other factors. We employ a hybrid deployment model to align to our customers technology preferences for their core financial management software across on-premise, cloud deployments or any combination of these models. Over time, we expect both existing and newly acquired customers to continue to shift towards cloud deployment models. Cloud-based subscription sales to new customers have grown at a faster rate than on-premise software subscription sales, which is a trend that we expect to continue over time. We generated 49 and 45 of software subscription revenue from cloud-based subscriptions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 48 and 44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While our on-premise software subscription revenue comprised 51 and 55 of our software subscription revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 52 and 56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, it continues to decrease as a percentage of total software subscriptions revenues as cloud-based subscriptions grow. We license our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which focuses on selling to qualified leads provided by our marketing efforts, and through our network of referral partners. We also utilize indirect sales to a lesser extent to efficiently grow and scale our enterprise and mid-market revenues. Our partner ecosystem is a differentiating, competitive strength in both our software development and our sales and marketing activities. We integrate with key technology partners that span Enterprise Resource Planning ERP ), Customer Relationship Management CRM ), procurement, billing, Point of Sale POS and e-commerce. These partners include Adobe/Magento, Coupa, Microsoft Dynamics, NetSuite, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, SAP Ariba, Shopify,

 Workday and Zuora. We also collaborate with numerous accounting firms who have built implementation practices around our software to serve their customer base. We believe that global commerce and the compliance environment provides durable and accelerating growth opportunities for our business. We generated revenue of 170.4 million and 145.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 488.3 and 417.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had net income (loss) of 7.2 million and (3.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15.1 million and (28.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively These amounts are presented in accordance with United States U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss or income before interest (including adjustments to the settlement value of deferred purchase commitment liabilities), taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude charges for asset impairments, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation costs, severance expense, acquisition contingent consideration, litigation settlements, and transaction costs. Adjusted EBITDA was 38.6 million and 26.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 113.9 million and 68.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Business Metrics and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion of key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures and their comparison to GAAP financial measures. We believe that we currently have ample liquidity and capital resources to continue to meet our operating needs, and our ability to continue to service our debt or other financial obligations is not currently impaired. For a further description of our liquidity, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Recent Developments ecosio GmbH Acquisition On August 30, 2024, we purchased 100 of the share interests in ecosio GmbH ecosio ), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Austria and a provider of electronic data interchange EDI and e-invoicing services.

For further information, refer to Note 8, Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue We generate revenue from software subscriptions and services. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowance for subscription and non-renewal cancellations and any taxes collected from customers that are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Software Subscriptions Licenses for on-premise software subscriptions, which are generally one year, provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers purchase a subscription to these licenses, which includes the related software and tax content updates and product support. The updates and support, which are part of the subscription agreement, are essential to the continued utility of the software; therefore, we have determined the software and the related updates and support to be a single performance obligation. Accordingly, when on-premise software is licensed, the revenue associated with this combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the license term as these subscriptions are provided for the duration of the license term. Revenue recognition begins on the later of the beginning of the subscription period or the date the software is made available to the customer to download.

 Our cloud-based subscriptions allow customers to use Vertex-hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. The contracts are generally for one to three years and are generally billed annually in advance of the subscription period. Our cloud-based offerings also include related updates and support. Revenue recognition begins on the later of the beginning of the subscription period or the date the customer is provided access to the cloud-based solutions. All services within the cloud-based contracts consistently provide a benefit to the customer during the subscription period; thus, the associated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue is impacted by the timing of sales and our customers growth or contractions resulting in their need to expand or contract their subscription usage, the purchase of new solutions, or the non-renewal of existing solutions. In addition, revenue will fluctuate with the cessation of extended product support fees charged for older versions of our software subscription solutions when they are retired and these fees are no longer charged. Contracts for on-premise licenses permit cancellations at the end of the license term, which is generally one year. Legacy cloud-based subscription contracts for multi-year periods previously provided customers the right to terminate their contract for services prior to the end of the subscription period at a significant penalty. This penalty requires the payment of a percentage of the remaining months of the then-current contract term. Current cloud-based contracts do not contain such termination rights. Terminations of cloud-based subscriptions prior to the end of the subscription term have occurred infrequently, and the impact has been immaterial. The allowance for subscription and non-renewal cancellations reflects an estimate of the amount of such cancellations and non-renewals based on past experience, current information, and forward-looking economic considerations. Services Revenue We generate services revenue primarily in support of our customers needs associated with our software and to enable them to realize the full benefit of our solutions. These software subscription-related services include configuration, data migration and implementation, and premium support and training. In addition, we generate services revenue through our managed services offering which allows customers to outsource all or a portion of their indirect tax operations to us. These services include indirect tax return preparation, filing and tax payment, and notice management. We generally bill for services on a per-transaction or time and materials basis, and we recognize revenue from deliverable-based professional services as services are performed. Fluctuations in services revenue are directly correlated to fluctuations in our subscription revenues with respect to implementation and training services as we have historically experienced an attachment rate to subscription sales for these services of approximately 60 . In addition, our managed services offering has continued to experience increased revenues associated with returns processing volume increases attributable to regulatory changes, as customers expanded their tax filings into more jurisdictions. Cost of Revenue Software Subscriptions Cost of software subscriptions revenue consists of costs related to providing and supporting our software subscriptions and includes personnel and related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. In addition, cost of revenue includes direct costs associated with information technology, such as data center and software hosting costs, and tax content maintenance. Cost of software subscriptions revenue also includes amortization associated with direct labor and related expenses for capitalized internal-use software for cloud-based subscription solutions and software developed for sale for new products and enhancements to existing products, and costs associated with the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. We plan to continue to significantly expand our infrastructure and personnel to support our future growth and increases in transaction volumes of our cloud-based solutions, including through acquisitions. We expect growth in our business will result in an increase in cost of software subscriptions revenue in absolute dollars. Services Cost of services revenue consists of direct costs of software subscription-related services and our managed services offering. These costs include personnel and related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and the cost of third-party contractors and other direct expenses. We plan to continue to expand our

Table of Contents 
 infrastructure and personnel as necessary to support our future growth and related increases in our service revenue. We expect growth in our business will result in an increase in the cost of services revenue in absolute dollars. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our research and development activities, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and the cost of third-party developers and other contractors. Research and development costs, other than software development expenses qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. We devote substantial resources to developing new products and enhancing existing products, conducting quality assurance testing, improving our core technology, and integrating acquired technology with our products. We believe continued investments in research and development are critical to attain our strategic objectives and expect research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars. These investments include enhancing our solution offerings to address changing customer needs to support their growth, as well as implementing changes required to keep pace with our partners technology to ensure the continued ability of our solutions to work together and deliver value to our customers. The market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. As a result, although we are making significant research and development expenditures, certain of which may be capitalized, there is no guarantee these solutions will be accepted by the market. This could result in increased costs or an impairment of capitalized development costs with no resulting future revenue benefit. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses in support of sales and marketing efforts. These costs include salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. In addition, selling expense includes costs related to advertising and promotion efforts, branding costs, partner-based commissions, costs associated with our annual customer conferences and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities in the future to continue to increase our brand awareness and expect these costs to increase on an absolute dollar basis as we grow our business and continue to expand our market and partner ecosystem penetration. Sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period-to-period based on total revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions, as these investments will occur in advance of experiencing the benefits from such investments and may vary in scope and scale over future periods. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for administrative, finance, information technology, legal, risk management, facilities, and human resources staffing, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, severance, stock-based compensation, professional fees, insurance premiums, facility costs, amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation costs related to our ERP modernization initiative, and other internal support and infrastructure costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations, hire additional personnel, integrate current and future acquisitions, and incur additional costs associated with being a publicly-listed company, including costs related to compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 beginning in 2023, as well as the additional requirements resulting from the Company's loss of emerging growth company status. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the allocation of purchased and developed asset costs over the future periods benefitted by the use of these assets. These assets include leasehold improvements for our facilities, computers and equipment needed to support our customers and our internal infrastructure and capitalized internal-use software associated with our internal tools. Depreciation and amortization will fluctuate in correlation with our ongoing investment in internal infrastructure costs to support our growth.

 Other Operating Expense (Income), net Other operating expense (income), net consists primarily of transactions costs associated with merger and acquisition activities, periodic remeasurement of contingent consideration associated with completed acquisitions, realized gains and losses on foreign currency changes, and other operating gains and losses. These amounts will fluctuate as a result of ongoing merger and acquisition activities and for changes in foreign currency rates. Interest Expense (Income), net Interest expense (income), net reflects the net amount of our interest expense and interest income within the same period. Interest expense consists primarily of interest incurred related to borrowings, the Notes, bank credit facility and leases. Interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing fees over the term of the credit facility or write-downs of such costs upon redemption of debt. Interest expense will vary as a result of fluctuations in the level of debt outstanding as well as interest rates on such debt. In addition, interest expense will include adjustments to the fair value of contracts that may be entered into to hedge risks associated with currency fluctuations for cash receipts or cash payments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and which do not qualify for hedge accounting, as well as changes in the settlement value of the future payment obligation for the Systax Sistemas Fiscais Limited Systax acquisition, which was fully settled on June 5, 2024. Interest income reflects earnings on investments of our cash on hand and our investment securities. Interest income will vary as a result of fluctuations in the future level of funds available for investment and the rate of return available in the market on such funds. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Income tax expense (benefit) consists primarily of federal, foreign, state, and local taxes on our loss or income. In determining our annualized effective income tax rates, net deferred tax assets, valuation allowances, and cash paid for income taxes, we are required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and usage of net operating loss and credit carryforwards, applicable tax rates, and transfer pricing methodologies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could materially differ from our projections.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Period-Over-Period Change (unaudited) Revenues: Software subscriptions 146,254 121,285 24,969 20.6 Services 24,181 23,742 439 1.8 Total revenues 170,435 145,027 25,408 17.5 Revenues increased 25.4 million, or 17.5 , to 170.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 145.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in software subscriptions revenues of 25.0 million, or 20.6 , was primarily driven by increases from our existing customers through cross selling new products, and to a lesser extent, increases due to expanded use and price increases. Software subscriptions revenues derived from new customers averaged 6.0 and 6.5 of total software subscriptions revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 0.4 million increase in services revenues was primarily driven by a 1.9 million increase in recurring services revenues due to returns processing volume increases related to customer business growth and regulatory changes as customers expanded their tax filings into more jurisdictions, as well as an increase in interest received from our funds held for customers. These increases were partially offset by a 1.5 million decrease in service revenues primarily from the impact of our previously discussed effort to steer more implementation opportunities to our channel partners, who are an important referral source for new software opportunities.

 Interest Expense (Income), Net 

For the three months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Period-Over-Period Change Interest expense (income), net (2,938) 597 (3,535) (592.1) Interest expense (income), net increased to income of 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an expense of 0.6 million for the same period in 2023. This change was mainly due to several factors: a 3.8 million increase in interest income primarily due to increased dollars invested during the period, a reduction of 0.8 million of interest expense related to the term loan repayment, and 0.2 million related to the valuation of our prior year foreign currency forward contracts due to market fluctuations. These interest income increases were partially offset by 0.7 million of interest expense and a 0.6 million increase in deferred financing costs related to the convertible debt issuance. Income Tax Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Period-Over-Period Change Income tax expense 613 784 (171) (21.8) Income tax expense was 0.6 million and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in tax expense was primarily driven by fluctuations in valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets, tax benefits from stock-based awards exercised or vested during the quarter, net of the impact from limitations on deductions of certain employees compensation, and benefits from tax credits partially offset by changes in taxes in profitable jurisdictions. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues 

For the nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Year-Over-Year Change (unaudited) Revenues: Software subscriptions 414,527 350,135 64,392 18.4 Services 73,793 67,338 6,455 9.6 Total revenues 488,320 417,473 70,847 17.0 Revenues increased 70.8 million, or 17.0 , to 488.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 417.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in software subscriptions revenues of 64.4 million, or 18.4 , was primarily driven by increases from our existing customers through cross selling new products, and to a lesser extent, increases due to expanded use and price increases. Software subscriptions revenues derived from new customers averaged 5.8 and 6.5 of total software subscriptions revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 6.5 million increase in services revenues was primarily driven by an increase of 3.1 million in software subscription-related services associated with the growth in subscription revenues, which includes new customers implementing our solutions and existing customers upgrading to newer versions of our solutions. In addition, our managed services offering experienced a 3.3 million increase driven by an increase in recurring services revenues over the prior year due to returns processing volume increases related to customer business growth and regulatory changes as customers expanded their tax filings into more jurisdictions, as well as an increase in interest received from our funds held for customers.

 Cost of Software Subscriptions Revenues 

For the nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Year-Over-Year Change Cost of software subscriptions revenues 131,030 116,974 14,056 12.0 Cost of software subscriptions revenues increased 14.1 million, or 12.0 , to 131.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 117.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cost of software subscriptions revenues was primarily driven by a 9.1 million increase in costs of personnel supporting period-over-period growth of sales and customers, ongoing infrastructure investments and support costs to enable the continued expansion of customer transaction volumes for our cloud-based subscription customers. In addition, the increase in cost of software subscriptions revenues included an increase in depreciation and amortization of 5.0 million associated with our ongoing investments in internal-use software for cloud-based subscription solutions, software developed for sale for new products and enhancements to existing products, and costs associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

The increase in research and development expenses is due primarily to an increase in personnel costs related to development work associated with new solutions to address end-to-end data analysis and compliance needs of our customers, and continued expansion of connectors and APIs to customer ERP and other software platforms. Research and development expense excludes those costs that have been capitalized for solutions that have met our capitalization policy. Selling and Marketing

 General and administrative expenses increased 3.8 million, or 3.5 , to 112.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 109.1 million for the same period in 2023, driven by a 0.8 million increase in planned strategic investments in information technology infrastructure, business process reengineering and other initiatives to drive future operating leverage, as well as investments in employees, systems and other resources in support of our growth. Additionally, there was an increase of 1.4 million for the amortization of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs related to our ERP modernization initiative. Finally, there was a 1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense over the prior year. Depreciation and Amortization

The change was primarily due to a 5.0 million increase in interest income due to increased dollars invested during the period and a reduction of 1.2 million of interest expense related to the term loan repayment. This was partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in the valuation of our foreign currency forward contracts due to market fluctuations, a 1.6 million increase in interest expense and 1.4 million increase in deferred financing costs related to the convertible debt issuance.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 279.0 million and retained earnings of 14.5 million. In addition, we had 7.5 million in investment securities with a maturity date exceeding three months as of September 30, 2024, not included in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of capital include sales of our solutions, proceeds from bank lending facilities, and the offering of existing or future classes of stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had a credit agreement with a banking syndicate (the Credit Agreement that provides a 200.0 million revolving facility (the Line of Credit ). On April 26, 2024, we closed a private offering of 345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2029 (the Notes ). The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were 333.7 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discount and commissions, and other transaction and offering expenses. For additional information on the Notes, refer to Note 8, Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that our existing cash resources and our Line of Credit will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. If an early conversion notice occurs on our Notes, we have the option to pay cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of both. Also, we expect to have access to additional sources of funds in the capital markets, and we may, from time to time, seek additional capital through a combination of additional debt and/or equity financings. If we were to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms unacceptable to us. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

For the nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Year-Over-Year Change Net cash provided by operating activities 123,688 26,696 96,992 363.3 Net cash used in investing activities (133,268) (46,264) (87,004) (188.1) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 225,005 (6,003) 231,008 3,848.2 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes 810 (55) 865 1,572.7 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 216,235 (25,626) 241,861 943.8 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities of 123.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of net income of 15.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 93.5 million and cash inflows of 19.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities, which were partially offset by 4.4 million in payments for purchase commitment and contingent consideration liabilities in excess of their initial fair value. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to cash collections and customer growth during the period. These changes were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. These movements were primarily due to the timing of cash payments. Net cash provided by operating activities of 26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of net loss of 28.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 75.0 million and cash outflows of 19.9 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable which was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These movements were primarily due to timing of cash collections and payments during the period. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities of 133.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of investments in property and equipment, and capitalized software of 47.5 million and 16.4 million,

 respectively, related to investments in infrastructure, new products, and enhancements to existing products. Additionally, we paid 71.8 million related to acquisitions completed during the second and third quarters of 2024. Finally, we invested 12.2 million in available-for-sale investment securities, which was more than offset by proceeds of 14.6 million received during the period for sales and maturities in our investment securities. For additional information on our acquisitions, refer to Note 3, Acquisitions to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Net cash used in investing activities of 46.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of investments in property and equipment, and capitalized software of 35.4 million and 14.1 million, respectively, related to infrastructure investments to drive operating leverage and commercial solutions to support our customers. Additionally, we invested 12.9 million in available-for-sale investment securities, which was more than offset by proceeds of 16.0 million received during the period for sales and maturities in our investment securities. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities of 225.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 345.0 million in gross proceeds from our Notes, as well as a 6.0 million increase in customer funds obligations, primarily due to timing differences between receipt of funds from customers and taxing jurisdiction withdrawals of these funds. These transactions were partly offset by 46.9 million for the repayment of our term loan, 42.4 million for the purchase of the Capped Call Transactions, 3.9 million in payments of third-party debt, 20.0 million in payments for taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based awards, 11.4 million for payments related to deferred financing costs and 7.6 million for payments on purchase commitment and contingent consideration liabilities.

These transactions were partially offset by a 17.0 million increase in customer funds obligations, primarily due to timing differences between receipt of funds from customers and taxing jurisdiction withdrawals of these funds, and 3.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Debt . As of September 30, 2024, we had a 200.0 million Line of Credit with no outstanding borrowings in connection with our Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had 345.0 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding related to our Notes. For additional information on our debt refer to Note 8, Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Funds Held for Customers and Customer Funds Obligations We maintain trust accounts with financial institutions, which allow our customers to outsource their tax remittance functions to us. We have legal ownership over the accounts utilized for this purpose. Funds held for customers represent cash and cash equivalents that, based upon our intent, are restricted solely for satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to our tax remittance services. Funds held for customers are not commingled with our operating funds. Customer funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit collected funds to satisfy customer tax payments. Customer funds obligations are reported as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the obligations are expected to be settled within one year. Cash flows related to changes in customer funds obligations liability are presented as cash flows from financing activities. Contractual Obligations and Commitments In connection with the pricing of the Notes on April 23, 2024, the Company entered into Capped Call Transactions. For additional information regarding the Capped Call Transactions, refer to Note 8, Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 As a result of the August 30, 2024 ecosio acquisition, we may be obligated to make annual payouts for Earn-outs based on ecosio s achievement of certain financial targets over a three-year period. For additional information on the ecosio acquisition, refer to Note 3, Acquisitions to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no other material updates or changes to our contractual obligations and commitments compared to contractual obligations and commitments described in our 2023 Annual Repor t, other than those noted above . Key Business Metrics We regularly review the metrics identified below to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Annual Recurring Revenue ARR and Average Annual Revenue Per Customer AARPC ). We derive the vast majority of our revenue from recurring software subscriptions. We believe ARR provides us with visibility to our projected software subscription revenue in order to evaluate the health of our business. Because we recognize subscription revenue ratably, we believe investors can use ARR to measure our expansion of existing customer revenues, new customer activity, and as an indicator of future software subscription revenues. ARR is based on monthly recurring revenue MRR from software subscriptions for the most recent month at period end, multiplied by twelve. MRR is calculated by dividing the software subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of subscription covered months. MRR only includes customers with MRR at the end of the last month of the measurement period. AARPC represents average annual revenue per customer and is calculated by dividing ARR by the number of software subscription customers at the end of the respective period. 

As of September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Year-Over-Year Change Annual Recurring Revenue 576.8 484.9 91.9 19.0 ARR increased by 91.9 million, or 19.0 , at September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 52.6 million of growth in revenues from existing customers through their expanded use of our solutions as well as price increases, and 25.3 million in growth of subscriptions of our solutions to new customers. Addionally, 5.9 million was added to ARR due to the inclusion of Systax s ARR, which was included as a result of the acquisition of the remaining ownership interests of Systax during the second quarter of 2024, and 8.1 million was added to ARR due to the ecosio acquisition during the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the impact of Systax and ecosio, the ARR growth rate would have been 16.1 . We had 4,855 direct customers and AARPC was approximately 118,800 at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2023, we had 4,303 direct customers and approximately 112,690 of AARPC. The increase in AARPC was primarily due to expansion of usage by existing customers and adding new customers through organic growth. Additionally, the inclusion of Systax and ecosio added 574 customers to the third quarter of 2024.

 Net Revenue Retention Rate NRR ). We believe that our NRR provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. We also believe it demonstrates to investors our ability to expand existing customer revenues, which is one of our key growth strategies. Our NRR refers to the ARR expansion during the 12 months of a reporting period for all customers who were part of our customer base at the beginning of the reporting period. Our NRR calculation takes into account any revenue lost from departing customers or those who have downgraded or reduced usage, as well as any revenue expansion from migrations, new licenses for additional products or contractual and usage-based price changes. 

As of September 30, 2024 2023 Net Revenue Retention Rate 111 111 Gross Revenue Retention Rate GRR ). We believe our GRR provides insight into and demonstrates to investors our ability to retain revenues from our existing customers. Our GRR refers to how much of our MRR we retain each month after reduction for the effects of revenues lost from departing customers or those who have downgraded or reduced usage. GRR does not take into account revenue expansion from migrations, new licenses for additional products or contractual and usage-based price changes. GRR does not include revenue reductions resulting from cancellations of customer subscriptions that are replaced by new subscriptions associated with customer migrations to a newer version of the related software solution. 

As of September 30, 2024 2023 Gross Revenue Retention Rate 95 96 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts and investors to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance as they measure business performance focusing on cash related charges and because they are important metrics to lenders under our credit agreement. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss or income before interest (including adjustments to the settlement value of deferred purchase commitment liabilities), taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as adjusted to exclude charges for asset impairments, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of cloud computing arrangement implementation costs, severance expense, acquisition contingent consideration, litigation settlements, and transaction costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues for the same period. For purposes of comparison, our net income (loss) was 7.2 million and (3.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while our net income (loss) margin was 4.2 and (2.3) over the same periods, respectively. Additionally,

 our net income (loss) was 15.1 million and (28.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while our net income (loss) margin was 3.1 and (6.8) over the same periods, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 22.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.4 for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to increased non-GAAP gross margin from both our software subscriptions and professional services revenue. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 45.1 million over the comparable period in 2023 was primarily driven by an increase of 61.0 million in non-GAAP gross profit, partly offset by an 16.3 million increase in non-GAAP selling and marketing expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.5 for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to increased non-GAAP gross margin from both our software subscriptions and professional services revenue. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is also partially due to the previously announced strategic investments that were made primarily during 2020 through 2023 into information technology infrastructure, business and re-engineering processes, employees, and other initiatives, which were strategically aimed to deliver consistent revenue growth, drive future earnings leverage, and expand adjusted EBITDA margins. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin. We use free cash flow as a critical measure in the evaluation of liquidity in conjunction with related GAAP amounts. We also use this measure when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to dividends and discretionary investments. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure for investors because it measures the amount of cash we generate from our operations after our capital expenditures and capitalization of software development costs. In addition, we base certain of our forward-looking estimates and budgets on free cash flow and free

 cash flow margin. We define free cash flow as the total of net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by total revenues for the same period. Our net cash provided by operating activities was 41.4 million and 27.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while our operating cash flow margin was 24.3 and 19.0 over the same periods, respectively. Our net cash provided by operating activities was 123.7 million and 26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while our operating cash flow margin was 25.3 and 6.4 over the same periods, respectively. 

For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 (unaudited) Free Cash Flow: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 41,396 27,594 123,688 26,696 Property and equipment additions (17,771) (13,498) (47,520) (35,357) Capitalized software additions (5,260) (5,041) (16,357) (14,083) Free cash flow 18,365 9,055 59,811 (22,744) Free Cash Flow Margin: Total revenues 170,435 145,027 488,320 417,473 Free cash flow margin 10.8 6.2 12.2 (5.4) Free cash flow increased by 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of 13.8 million, primarily attributable to customer growth and cash collections during the period. This increase was partly offset by a 4.3 million increase in ongoing investments in internal-use software for cloud-based subscription solutions and software developed for sale for new products and enhancements to existing products. Free cash flow margin increased to 10.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.2 for the same period in 2023. Free cash flow increased by 82.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of 97.0 million, primarily attributable to customer growth and cash collections during the period. This increase was partly offset by a 12.2 million increase in ongoing investments in internal-use software for cloud-based subscription solutions and software developed for sale for new products and enhancements to existing products. Free cash flow margin increased to 12.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (5.4) for the same period in 2023. Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we have calculated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP selling and marketing expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income, which are each non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided tabular reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate financial performance. We use non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow and free cash flow margin to evaluate liquidity. Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as supplemental disclosure as we believe they provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results, prospects, and liquidity period-over-period without the impact of certain items that do not directly correlate to our operating performance and that may vary significantly from period to period for reasons unrelated to our operating performance, as well as comparing our financial results to those of other companies. Our 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin calculated and discussed in Key Business Metrics, the following additional non-GAAP financial measures are calculated and presented further below: Non-GAAP cost of revenues, software subscriptions is determined by adding back to GAAP cost of revenues, software subscriptions, the stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and acquired intangible assets included in cost of subscription revenues for the respective periods. Non-GAAP cost of revenues, services is determined by adding back to GAAP cost of revenues, services, the stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenues, services for the respective periods. Non-GAAP gross profit is determined by adding back to GAAP gross profit the stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and acquired intangible assets included in cost of subscription revenues for the respective periods. Non-GAAP gross margin is determined by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by total revenues for the respective periods. Non-GAAP research and development expense is determined by adding back to GAAP research and development expense the stock-based compensation expense and transaction costs related to acquired technology included in research and development expense for the respective periods. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expense is determined by adding back to GAAP selling and marketing expense the stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets included in selling and marketing expense for the respective periods. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense is determined by adding back to GAAP general and administrative expense the stock-based compensation expense, amortization of cloud computing implementation costs and severance expense included in general and administrative expense for the respective periods. 
 Non-GAAP operating income is determined by adding back to GAAP loss or income from operations the stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and acquired intangible assets included in cost of subscription revenues, amortization of acquired intangible assets included in selling and marketing expense, amortization of cloud computing implementation costs in general and administrative expense, severance expense, acquisition contingent consideration, litigation settlements, and transaction costs, included in GAAP loss or income from operations for the respective periods. Non-GAAP net income is determined by adding back to GAAP net income or loss income tax benefit or expense, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and acquired intangible assets included in cost of subscription revenues, amortization of acquired intangible assets included in selling and marketing expense, amortization of cloud computing implementation costs in general and administrative expense, severance expense, acquisition contingent consideration, adjustments to the settlement value of deferred purchase commitment liabilities recorded as interest expense, litigation settlements, and transaction costs, included in GAAP net income or loss for the respective periods to determine non-GAAP income or loss before income taxes. Non-GAAP income or loss before income taxes 

 55 

Table of Contents 
 is then adjusted for income taxes calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for applicable jurisdictions, which for purposes of this determination were assumed to be 25.5 . 
 We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the related GAAP financial measures. The following schedules reflect our additional non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles our additional non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures.

 Critical Accounting Estimates The critical accounting policies that reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition and income taxes, which are described in our 2023 Annual Report. Business Combination Fair Value Estimates The results of a business acquired in a business combination are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, consideration transferred, and amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, which may be considered preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date (the Measurement Period ). Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of these amounts requires significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, and selection of comparable companies. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions periodically and record any adjustments to preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided we are within the Measurement Period, with any adjustments to amortization of new or previously recorded assets and identifiable intangibles being recorded to the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss in the period in which they arise. In addition, if outside of the Measurement Period, any subsequent adjustments to the acquisition date fair values are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss in the period in which they arise. We use our best estimates, information and assumptions available at the acquisition date to assign preliminary fair values to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, consideration transferred, and amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests. We engage the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to perform valuations of these amounts and to assist us in concluding on these fair value measurements. The resulting fair values and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used then the purchase price for the respective acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset, an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities, or an impairment of some or all of the goodwill. There have been no other material updates or changes to our critical accounting estimates compared to the critical accounting estimates described in our 2023 Annual Report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For further information on recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 279.0 million and 68.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and investments of 7.5 million and 9.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts, money market funds with various financial institutions, and in short duration fixed income securities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Increases or declines in interest rates would be expected to augment or reduce future interest income by an insignificant amount. 

 59 

Table of Contents 
 We are exposed to risk related to changes in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at rates that are variable. Increases in the bank prime or SOFR rates would increase the interest rate on any future outstanding borrowings. Any debt we incur in the future may also bear interest at variable rates. Our Notes have a fixed annual interest rate; therefore, we have no financial or economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate debt instruments fluctuates when interest rates change. Additionally, the fair value of the Notes can be affected when the market price of our common stock fluctuates. We carry the Notes at principal value less unamortized issuance costs on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and we present fair value for required disclosure purposes only. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. For our foreign operations, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in other currencies, such as the Canadian Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Swedish Krona, and Brazilian Real. Decreases in the relative value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies may negatively affect our revenues and other operating results as expressed in U.S. Dollars. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 3 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss or income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have historically recognized immaterial amounts of foreign currency gains and losses in each of the periods presented. We may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as we expand our international operations and our risk grows.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II---OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On January 25, 2022, we filed a complaint (subsequently amended on February 9, 2022) against Avalara, Inc. Avalara in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges claims of unfair competition, intentional interference with contractual relations, and trade secret misappropriation against Avalara. We are seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Avalara from further interference with our contractual relations and prohibit the disclosure in any way of our confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information. We are also seeking monetary damages, including punitive damages and attorney s fees. As of September 30, 2024, the matter remains before the Court and is proceeding through the discovery process. We believe the allegations in the complaint, once proven, are sufficient to prevail in this matter. However, the eventual outcome of the case is subject to a number of uncertainties, and therefore we cannot offer any assurance as to the ultimate impact of this case on our business and operations. In addition to the foregoing matter, from time to time, we may be involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. We are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This document incorporates by reference various risk factors discussed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, under the heading Risk Factors . There are no material changes to the risk factors discussed in these filings. You should carefully consider these risks, together with management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If any of the events contemplated should occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could suffer significantly. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4 . MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION During the three months ended September 30, 2024, or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
