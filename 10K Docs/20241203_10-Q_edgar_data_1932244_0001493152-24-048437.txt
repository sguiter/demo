Business
Strategy 

As
part of AI Unlimited Group s innovative incubator model, we are dedicated to advancing each of our AI-powered applications Lever
App, Nest Egg, Travl, and Resolve to meet the unique needs of consumers and businesses. Our strategy emphasizes developing cutting-edge
solutions across fintech, investment, travel, and debt management, leveraging shared resources and AI expertise to accelerate growth
and maximize market impact. The following growth strategies are fundamental to our vision: 

Product
 Completion and Launches: We launched version 1 of our core apps with a soft rollout in Q3
 of fiscal 2024 and have since expanded features and optimized performance. We anticipate
 public releases and increased functionality across our apps by Q2 of fiscal 2025. 
 
 Multi-Channel
 Subscriber Acquisition: Each app will grow its user base through robust digital and traditional
 marketing strategies. By focusing on targeted and data-driven campaigns, we aim to drive
 subscriber acquisition while maximizing cost efficiency across our product suite. 
 
 Enhanced
 Financial and Lifestyle Solutions: We are committed to continuously refining our core applications,
 like the Lever App, which serves student debt holders, and introducing broader features across
 Nest Egg for investment strategies, Travl for AI-powered travel experiences, and Resolve
 for streamlined debt collections, offering holistic solutions for consumers and small businesses
 alike. 
 
 Enterprise
 and Partner Expansion: Growth will be further fueled by enterprise partnerships, employer-based
 programs, and integration with educational, financial, and corporate entities. We are actively
 pursuing collaborations to support market expansion and enhance our value proposition. 
 
 Cutting-Edge
 AI and Machine Learning Capabilities: Our software development team focuses on disruptive
 machine learning and AI technologies to deliver highly personalized and data-driven recommendations,
 ensuring continued subscriber engagement and satisfaction across all products. 
 
 Strategic
 Acquisitions and Partnerships: AI Unlimited Group will look to acquire synergistic businesses
 and form alliances that drive user growth, expand our technology base, and integrate complementary
 tools to further enhance our value offering. 
 
 Global
 Market Reach and Product Diversification: As we expand, we will identify and enter high-growth
 markets for each app s core service area, from travel planning and investment to debt
 management. Lever, for instance, is exploring additional consumer debt solutions like credit
 card and auto loan refinancing, while Nest Egg and Travl expand into global investment and
 travel markets. 

With
the recent resumption of student loan repayments, the Lever App is well-positioned to support the nearly million Americans resuming
payments after forbearance. Lever s AI-powered platform provides solutions tailored to manage, automate, and simplify student loan
repayments, addressing this urgent market need. This includes refining user interfaces
and providing tools to allow seamless navigation of complex debt obligations. 

AI
Unlimited Group anticipates maintaining a customer acquisition cost (CAC) of approximately per user, with user subscriptions priced
at annually across applicable apps. This pricing model generates an anticipated lifetime value over ten years, solidifying a steady
revenue stream. We have budgeted monthly to support marketing and sales initiatives, aiming for consistent onboarding of around
 new user subscriptions per month across the company s ecosystem. 

Through
our incubator approach, we unify these apps under a cohesive, AI-powered platform, creating a multi-faceted, user-friendly experience
that addresses critical financial and lifestyle needs. Our integrated strategy ensures that each app is positioned to leverage shared
technological and operational resources, fostering innovation, scalability, and market leadership in a digital-first, AI-enhanced landscape. 

NOTE
1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Marketing
and Sales 

AI
Unlimited Group (AIUG) is strategically focused on scaling its portfolio of apps, including Nest Egg, Travl.App, Lever, and Resolve,
by executing a multi-channel marketing approach designed to build a robust user base and enhance brand loyalty. Our marketing strategy
is a blend of innovative digital initiatives and proven traditional tactics, all aimed at providing an omnichannel customer experience. 

Integrated
Marketing Strategy Our primary objective is to expand our paid customer base through a combination of targeted digital marketing,
community engagement, and selective partnerships. We recognize that modern consumers require a personalized approach, and our strategy
is to offer both broad and tailored solutions that resonate with each app s target audience. 

Digital
Marketing AIUG s digital marketing efforts encompass a diverse set of channels, including: 

Search
 Engine Optimization (SEO): Driving organic traffic by optimizing content for search engines,
 particularly around financial and travel-related keywords. 
 
 Content
 Marketing: Leveraging educational blogs, targeted email campaigns, and influencer partnerships
 to build credibility and drive engagement. 
 
 Social
 Media: Engaging with high-profile influencers and celebrities to increase visibility
 across platforms like Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and LinkedIn, with Bolis Media managing
 the social media strategy for each app. Social campaigns will include content crafted by
 creators in finance, travel, student loans, and debt collection fields, tailored to each
 app s unique audience. 

Traditional
Marketing Initiatives While digital channels provide scalability, traditional marketing avenues such as conferences, trade shows,
and direct meetings with potential subscribers add a personal touch that builds deeper connections: 

Event
 Participation: Our management team actively participates in industry conferences and
 expos, delivering presentations and connecting directly with potential users and partners. 
 
 Campus
 Outreach: We have established partnerships with educational institutions across key states,
 engaging recent graduates with in-person workshops and digital campaigns. 
 
 Community
 Engagement: By targeting areas with high student debt or travel interest, like California,
 Texas, and Washington, our traditional marketing efforts extend our reach and solidify our
 brand presence. 

Geo-Targeted
Strategies AIUG s marketing efforts are tailored to regional nuances and demographics: 

California:
 Targeting tech-savvy graduates and financial influencers, we focus on institutions like
 UCLA and Stanford. 
 
 Texas:
 Leveraging the state s large student population and economic growth, we focus on
 institutions like UTSA and San Antonio College. 
 
 Washington,
 D.C.: Positioned as the highest student debt region, our strategy includes aligning with
 policymakers and hosting webinars to address student loan complexities. 

Official
Launch and Initial Rollout The Lever App s official public launch was Q2 fiscal 2025, with a planned promotional push across
both digital and traditional channels. As part of our go-to-market strategy, we will employ billboards, video-on-demand ads, and event
sponsorships on university campuses to drive downloads. In addition, AIUG will introduce the Travl Coin for Travl.App, scheduled for
launch in 2025, which will allow users to buy, save, and spend within the app ecosystem, enhancing customer loyalty and engagement. 

Bolis
Media Partnership and Budget Allocation In collaboration with Bolis Media, AIUG has allocated a six-month marketing budget to enhance
visibility across all apps: 

Content
 Production and Media Placement: Bolis Media will handle content creation, media activations,
 and influencer partnerships, providing each app with curated and impactful media presence. 
 
 Paid
 Ad Budget: Allocated equally across apps, with dynamic reallocation based on performance
 metrics monitored by Bolis Media. 
 
 Performance
 Tracking: Bolis Media s analytics team will continuously monitor results, enabling
 real-time adjustments for optimized reach and engagement. 

Customer
Acquisition and Retention AIUG s estimated customer acquisition cost (CAC) is set at around per user, with an expected
average subscription duration of 10 years per user, providing significant lifetime value. Given the recent changes in data privacy laws
(e.g., iOS 14 privacy updates), we anticipate a increase in CAC, which has been accounted for in our marketing budget. To offset
these challenges, AIUG is focused on in-depth customer journey mapping to improve conversion rates and user retention across all apps. 

In-House
and External Resource Sharing By centralizing resources and expertise across all AIUG apps, our in-house development and marketing
teams collaborate to foster innovation. Shared talent and resources across Lever, Nest Egg, Travl.App, and Resolve ensure consistent
growth and product evolution, while minimizing redundancy in R D and marketing costs. This approach strengthens AIUG s position
as a holistic AI incubator, capable of scaling across diverse sectors from finance to travel and debt management.

significant combined student debt, and Washington, D.C. s distinction as the region with the nation s highest average student
debt underscore the urgent demand for our solutions. 

For
Q1 2025, the Company anticipates a surge in user engagement driven by the resumption of student loan interest, the recent equity capital
raise, and targeted marketing initiatives. In San Antonio, a close-knit community is expected to facilitate rapid word-of-mouth spread.
In California, with its vast student population, we project the highest user acquisition. Washington, D.C., with its policy-driven environment,
is anticipated to attract users seeking informed and structured loan management solutions. 

Projected
Consolidation and Expansion Phases 

As
we move into Q4 2024, the Company anticipates transitioning from an acquisition to a consolidation phase. Following the momentum from
Q4 campaigns, we expect stable user engagement and app utilization, particularly in California, where the tech-savvy population is likely
to lead in interaction metrics. San Antonio and Washington, D.C., are projected to show steady growth in active usage. 

With
a robust borrower base exceeding 400,000 in these regions, our marketing campaigns are designed to drive retention and app enhancements
through direct user feedback. San Antonio is expected to have the highest retention rates, California to see increased referrals, and
Washington, D.C., to yield insights into policy advocacy and partnership opportunities. 

Scaling
Beyond Core Regions 

Beyond
the initial phases, our goal is to solidify our position in these states and utilize the successes as a template for national expansion.
Our aim is to make AI Unlimited Group synonymous with effective student loan management, offering tailored solutions for every American
student and graduate.

The
US Government paused federal student loan repayments and interest during the pandemic throughout 2021 and extended it into the fall of
2022. Despite the freeze, student loan balances still increased as newer loans entered repayment, despite no current payment due on most
loans.

We
believe the personal debt management industry is highly fragmented and diversified, with several large and small companies offering various
debt management solutions. Our direct and indirect competition includes but is not limited to HR benefits platforms, round-up saving

companies. General financial content providers may also be considered indirect competition. Our target market is student loan borrowers
looking to better their financial future by paying their loans and saving money. We offer a unique solution catered to student loan management

The
U.S. Government paused federal student loan repayments and interest accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic, with extensions lasting into
the fall of 2022. Despite this temporary relief, student loan balances continued to grow as new loans entered repayment, and interest
continued to accrue on private loans and some federal loans. Currently, student loan debt impacts approximately million borrowers,
totaling over trillion, underscoring the need for effective and user-friendly debt management solutions.

NOTE
1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Market
Landscape and Competitive Position 

Our
industry is marked by active mergers and acquisitions, with large, well-capitalized companies acquiring digital debt management and fintech
platforms to enhance their offerings. Notable examples include LendingTree s acquisition of Student Loan Hero in 2018 and Acorns 
acquisition of AI startup Pillar in 2021. These moves underscore the attractiveness of debt management solutions in the current market. 

Our
comprehensive suite of AI-driven platforms spanning debt management, travel, and investment positions AI Unlimited Group
uniquely in the competitive landscape. We aim to serve high-value, high-potential customers through tailored digital experiences that
meet a diverse range of financial and lifestyle needs. 

By
leveraging shared talent and resources across Travl App, Nest Egg Investments, Resolve, and Lever, we are creating a collaborative ecosystem
that fosters innovation and drives growth across multiple verticals. Our aim is to make AI Unlimited Group the preferred platform for
users seeking intelligent, AI-powered solutions for financial empowerment and lifestyle enhancement. 

Our
industry is active in mergers and acquisitions of digital debt management software companies by large and well-capitalized companies
looking for complementary services. For example, in July 2018, LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE) announced today that it had entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire Student Loan Hero, Inc. (6) , a personal finance website dedicated to helping student loan
borrowers manage their student debt. In April 2021, Acorns, the Californian investment and savings app, landed its second acquisition
of 2021 with artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Pillar (7) . 

According
to the Harvard Kennedy School report (8) , the fintech industry deals with the dangers of potential misuse and abuse of consumer
data. This includes but is not limited to the loss of privacy, violation of data security, increasing risks of fraud and scams, unfair
and discriminatory uses of data and data analytics against rules and regulations, uses of data that are non-transparent to both consumers
and regulators; harmful manipulation of consumer behavior; and risks that tech firms entering the financial or financial regulatory space
will lack adequate knowledge, operational effectiveness, and stability. 

The
student loan forgiveness debate has entered the national conversation. White House officials plan to cancel in student debt per
borrower after months of internal deliberations over structuring loan forgiveness for tens of millions of Americans. According to the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, wiping out of debt per borrower could cost roughly 
billion. 

The
Company firmly believes that the student loan industry will continue to be the fastest-growing source of debt for United States households.
Student loans are now the largest source of unsecured debt in the United States. They have become a financial industry, especially with
its secondary market and student loan asset-backed securities.

2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in
Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ,
issued in August 2020 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock by removing the requirements to
present certain conversion features in equity separately. In addition, the amendments also simplify the guidance in ASC Subtopic 815-40,
Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, by removing certain criteria that must be satisfied to classify a contract
as equity, which is expected to decrease the number of freestanding instruments and embedded derivatives accounted for as assets or liabilities.
Finally, the amendments revise the guidance on calculating earnings per share, requiring the use of the if-converted method for all convertible
instruments and rescinding an entity s ability to rebut the presumption of share settlement for instruments that may be settled
in cash or other assets. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early
adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance must be adopted as of the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect this ASU 2020-06 to impact its condensed consolidated financial statements.

capital and corporate development needs as they become due in the ordinary course of business for twelve (12) months following December
31, 2023. From inception to September 30, 2024, the Company did not earn any significant revenues. The Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations and the ongoing requirement for substantial additional capital investment to develop its financial
technologies. 

Management
has considered various factors in evaluating the Company s sustainability and the ability to manage obligations due within a year.
Management has considered general economic conditions, key industry metrics, operating results, capital expenditures, commitments, and
future obligations and liquidity. If there is a delay in generating significant revenues by the end of December 31, 2024, the Company
will require capital infusion from new and existing investors, streamlining operating costs, and evaluating new business strategies to
enhance cash flow from operations. 

The
Management expects that it will need to raise significant additional capital to accomplish its growth plan over the next twelve (12)
months. The Management expects to seek additional funding through private equity or public markets. However, there can be no assurance
about the availability or terms such as financing and capital might be available.

To
the extent the Company s operations are insufficient to fund the Company s capital requirements, the Management may attempt
to enter into a revolving loan agreement with financial institutions or raise capital through the sale of additional capital stock or
issuance of debt. 

The
Management intends to continue enhancing its revenue from its Lever App subscription model, which it expects to launch in the second
quarter of fiscal 2024. In the meantime, the Company expects to raise funds through private placement offerings and debt financing. See

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Quarterly Report Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a

and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited condensed financial statements
and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided
pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future

seeking seamless booking and itinerary management, offering a comprehensive suite of features that include booking accommodations, flights,
and activities, all in one user-friendly application. The platform also provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences
and travel history. 

The
Company had a soft launch of the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on the iOS App Store. Currently, the app allows subscribers
to analyze their existing student loans and recommend programs offered by the US Department of Education after the initial assessment
and to process enrollment into these programs. The App provides a list of qualified federal programs. The subscribers can digitally enroll
in these programs by uploading or self-declaring their W-2, wage, or tax statements through the App. If subscribers are accepted for
a federal program, the App manages their annual certifications for a monthly subscription fee. The average life of a loan is twenty-one
years. The Company has partnered with Array US, Inc. to give subscribers personalized credit and financial data through the App, allowing
them to understand their borrowing capacity better. The subscribers can also use the information to manage their credit scores. 

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company added a round-up option, allowing subscribers to link their bank account and student loan
to the App and select to pay a few cents per transaction towards the principal of their student loan. The App will have a feature showing
the subscriber how the extra payments towards the loan will result in interest savings and reduce the loan term. 

In
fiscal 2023, the Company offered its subscribers the tools in the App to directly negotiate and refinance their outstanding credit card
and auto loans with their lenders. The Company plans to connect several credit card companies and auto loan providers to the App through
API. As well as provide more ways to save, spend, and invest through the development, acquisition, and key hires across these technologies.
The Company also plans to officially launch the App in the App Store and Play Store in the fiscal year 2024. There is no assurance that
the Company will be successful in future plans. 

The
App allows everyday people to directly negotiate, enroll, repay, and settle student loans for the US market without the complexity and
confusion of the fine print. The App helps subscribers with debt management - negotiation, repayment, and settlement. We are committed
to providing our subscribers with impartial guidance in their journey toward financial independence. The App will be available on the
Play Store (Android) and App Store (iOS) under Lever App (the App as its brand name for a subscription-based fee billed
monthly or annually. 

The
App will help the subscriber directly negotiate debt through continued education and recommendations on how and when to refinance the
student loan, federal student loan prequalification and enrollment, access credit scores, and other features that enable subscribers
to manage their debt obligations smartly, intuitively, and cost-effectively. The Company initially intends to target student debt holders
in the United States as its primary customer base. The Company believes that manually managing debt is complex and time-consuming, which
involves actively monitoring personal finances, estimating payments, negotiating with lenders, and finding the proper federal and state
grants and loan arrangements. Maintaining and monitoring these loan terms with annual renewals that can last up to twenty-one (21) years
on average isn t easy. 

A
student loan default has severe consequences for the borrower as it damages the borrower s credit score, making it difficult to
qualify for future loans. Still, the borrower may also be subject to wage garnishment when the lender automatically takes a portion of
the paycheck to repay the loan. In addition, defaulting on a student loan can lead to the seizure of tax refunds and Social Security
benefits. The Company believes that if borrowers struggle to make student loan payments, it s crucial to act before falling too
far behind. The Lever App allows the borrower to contact the loan servicer to discuss options, including deferment or forbearance. The
Company believes acting through its intuitive technology can help them avoid the devastating consequences of student loan default. 

4 

The
Company believes the student loan borrower will benefit from the App. Our Application Program Interface (APIs) and artificial intelligence
(AI) driven programming connect them to the right and relevant federal loan programs with the most favorable terms qualifying
amount and rate, enroll and save with a few clicks. The Lever App further informs the subscribers when and how to refinance their student
loans. Based on the subscriber s inputs, the Lever App provides visual guidelines on how the subscriber s budget and spending
suit their student loan repayments. 

The
Lever App provides subscribers instant matches through Student Aid, the largest provider of financial aid for college in the United States,
and other Federal student aid programs. The subscriber can access the complex world of student debt management in an easy four-step process
through the Lever App, which includes: 

Basic
 subscriber information per KYC requirements, 

The
 subscriber links one or multiple loans in real-time, also known as Enrollment, 

The
 software matches with up to three (3) options to manage loans (deferment or forbearance or reduced payments, etc.), and 

The
 subscriber picks the best option to connect to the best United States Government aid program to complete the application. 

Once
subscribers sync their respective loans with the Lever App, the software automates with a data-driven algorithm to match users with qualifying
federal loan programs. The App also provides credit score insights and payment round-up technology using open banking protocols that
help and recommend that loan borrowers contribute micro amounts towards their loan principal, save on years of interest, and reach financial
independence faster and better with the App. 

The
Company expects to continue to earn revenues through a subscription-based model, which will charge monthly recurring fees to subscribers.
The Company is developing and testing the App, which it expects to market and launch in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The App will
be available on the App Store and PlayStore. 

With
the U.S. Department of Education confirming the resumption of interest on student loans from September 1, 2023, and repayments resuming
October 1, 2023. Student loans represent a significant financial commitment for millions of individuals, often serving as the primary
means to fund higher education. These federal or private loans accrue interest over time, increasing the total amount borrowers owe.
The resumption of student loan payments, especially after periods of forbearance or deferment, can bring about additional costs. The
Company is poised to support millions of students and graduates. This initiative aims to bolster the company s resources, allowing
for expansion into new markets, enhancing user experience, and integrating advanced credit intelligence features. Over the past nine
months, the Company has undergone significant business and tech developments, from streamlining its UX/UI to introducing a simplified
identification system, ensuring users can easily navigate their loan management. 

We
are a development stage entity devoting all our efforts to substantially establishing our flagship product, the Lever App App ).
The App officially launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company had earned no significant revenues for the nine months
ending September 30, 2024, and 2023. The Company did not generate any revenues in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. Our independent
auditors have raised concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect the Company to raise significant additional
capital to accomplish its growth plan over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that financing and/or capital might
be available to the Company.

PLAN
OF OPERATIONS 

The
Company has prepared consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. The Company had earned no significant revenues for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, and 2022. 

Our
experienced Management and in-house software development team have carefully designed various B2C debt management solutions to meet the
needs of borrowers in the United States and Australia. We intend to grow our core business, increase market share, and improve profitability
principally by deploying the following growth strategies: 

Completed
 the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with the soft launch, and launch the App officially to the public in the second quarter
 of fiscal 2025; 

Ramp
 up subscriber acquisition through our digital and traditional marketing strategies; 

Continue
 to enhance and promote our core proprietary debt management platform and introduce other innovative debt management tools for the
 United States student loan borrowers; 

Future
 growth will depend on the timely development and successful distribution of the Lever App by signing enterprise and employer deals
 in the United States; 

Increase
 our software development capabilities to develop disruptive and next-generation machine learning and artificial intelligence-driven
 technologies to grow and retain subscriber base; 

Grow
 subscriber base through accretive acquisitions, opportunistic investments, and beneficial partnerships; and 

Recognize
 and enter high-growth markets to expand our services to meet the demand for other financial solutions, including but not limited
 to auto-save and auto loan payment from day-to-day debit card usage. 

Financial
Conditions at September 30, 2024 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 510,797 and 11,012 cash to execute its business plan and accumulated a deficit
of 9,157,767 and 4,908,051. The Company had a working capital surplus of 622,905 and deficit of 610,897 as of September 30,2024 and
December 31,2023, respectively. AIUG provided the working base source code for the launch of the Company, valued at 758,316, the contributed
tangible software. 

The
Company believes it has the necessary funding and in-house capabilities to develop and successfully launch the App. The Company budgets
 500,000 for sales and marketing campaigns in the next twelve months. Should we require additional capital to the extent the Company s
operations are insufficient to fund its capital requirements, the Company may attempt to raise capital through the issuance of equity
or debt. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern may depend on Management s plans success. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023

Company did not generate any revenue during the three months ending September 30, 2024, and 2023. During the three months ending September
30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had a net income loss of 2,088,425 and 1,231,491.

The
Company did not generate any revenue during the nine months ending September 30, 2024, and 2023. Dring the nine months ending September

and 211,410. The sales marketing costs mainly included payment to marketing and branding consultants, brand ambassadors, affiliate
marketing, customer meets and greet, online marketing on industry websites, press releases, and other public relations activities. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At
September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 510,797. The Company had a working capital surplus of 622,905 on September 30, 2024. 

Since
its inception, the Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Management believes that cash on hand may
not be sufficient for the Company to meet working capital and corporate development needs as they become due in the ordinary course of
business for twelve (12) months following September 30, 2024. The Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations
and the ongoing requirement for substantial additional capital investment to develop its financial technologies. We expect to conduct
the planned operations for twelve months using currently available capital resources. The Management anticipates raising additional capital
to accomplish its growth plan over the next twelve months. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new funding sources. The
Management expects to seek additional funding through private equity or public markets. However, there can be no assurance about the
availability or terms such as financing and capital might be available. 

In
the next twelve months, the Company will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support, development of technology solutions,
and enhancement of existing technology to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditure to increase to up to 250,000 in the next
twelve months to support the growth, which mainly includes software development, acquisition of complementary software, and purchasing
of computers and servers. In addition, the Company estimates additional expenditure needed to be 500,000, which provides 100,000 and
 400,000 for sales marketing, and working capital, respectively. 

For
the next nine to nine months, we intend to raise funding and make use of the existing cash on hand, and cash flows from operations to
fund our operating activities and other cash commitments, such as related party payments and material capital expenditures. However,
we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sale where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance
that any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.

GOING
CONCERN CONSIDERATION 

For
the nine months ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, and since inception, the Company did not earn any significant revenues. As of September
30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company accumulated a deficit of 9,157,767 and 4,908,051. Our independent auditors included an
explanatory paragraph in their report on the audited financial statements for the annual report on form 10K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with SEC on August 19, 2024.,
regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures
describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may
result in the Company being unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

We
have based our Management s discussion, and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements,
which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

In
more detail, we have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual report on form 10K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with SEC on August 19, 2024. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing
basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

We
are an emerging growth company , defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can
take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging
growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We
have elected not to avail ourselves of the delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, we will adopt new or revised
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for
other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC s Regulation S-B. We did not have any
relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that
would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption
of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
We have adopted this ASU as of the inception date of March 24, 2022, for ASC 606, Revenue Recognition and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 840). The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we have described
significant accounting policies in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in Form S-/A (Amendment 3) statements
filed with the SEC on September 19, 2022 , we believe the accounting policies as described in Note 2 to be critical to the judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

(d)
 Experience of the Purchaser . The Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication
and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment
in the Securities, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Securities and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment. 

(e)
 Access to Information . The Purchaser acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to review the Transaction Documents (including
all schedules thereto) and the SEC Reports and has been afforded, (i) the opportunity to ask such questions as it has deemed necessary
of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Securities
and the merits and risks of investing in the Securities; (ii) access to information about the Company and its financial condition, results

information or advice necessary or desired. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate has made or makes any representation as to the Company

nor has any Person acting on behalf of or pursuant to any understanding with the Purchaser, directly or indirectly executed any purchases

received details regarding this transaction (written or oral) from the Company or any other Person representing the Company setting forth
the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereunder and ending immediately prior to the execution hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate
portions of the Purchaser s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the
portfolio managers managing other portions of the Purchaser s assets, the representation set forth above shall only apply with
respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered
by this Agreement. Other than to other Persons party to this Agreement or to the Purchaser s representatives, including, without
limitation, its officers, directors, partners, legal and other advisors, employees, agents and Affiliates, the Purchaser has maintained
the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms of this transaction).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall constitute a representation or warranty, or
preclude any actions, with respect to locating or borrowing shares in order to effect Short Sales or similar transactions in the future.

The
Company acknowledges and agrees that the representations contained in this Section 3.2 shall not modify, amend or affect the Purchaser s
right to rely on the Company s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any representations and warranties
contained in any other Transaction Document or any other document or instrument executed and/or delivered in connection with this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained
herein shall constitute a representation or warranty, or preclude any actions, with respect to locating or borrowing shares in order
to effect Short Sales or similar transactions in the future.
