The Company preliminarily allocated million of the purchase consideration to customer relationships, million to acquired net assets, and the remaining million to goodwill. During the second quarter 2024 we subsequently increased the provisional amounts allocated to goodwill by million and adjusted the deferred tax liability position to reflect facts and circumstances in existence at the effective time of the acquisition. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company made a measurement period adjustment to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the effective time of the acquisition. This adjustment primarily included an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities and goodwill of million . 

Settlement obligations consist of accrued expenses for money transfers, content providers, and EFT customer deposits and accounts payable to agents and content providers. Money transfer accrued expenses represent amounts to be paid to transferees when they request funds. Most agents typically settle with transferees first then obtain reimbursement from us. M oney order accrued expenses represent amounts not yet presented for payment. Due to the agent funding and settlement process, accrued expenses to agents represent amounts due to agents for money transfers that have not been settled with transferees.

Net income for diluted earnings per share calculation 

Computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding: 

Basic weighted average shares outstanding 

Incremental shares from assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units 

Incremental shares from assumed conversion of convertible debt 

Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 

The table includes all stock options and restricted stock units that are dilutive to the Company's weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes stock options or shares of restricted stock units that are anti-dilutive to the Company's weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively . 
 The Company issued Convertible Senior Notes ("Convertible Notes") due March 2049 on March 18, 2019. The Convertible Notes currently have a settlement feature requiring us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of the debt and any conversion value in excess of the principal value ("conversion premium"), for cash or shares of Euronet's common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's option. The Company has stated its intent to settle any conversion of these notes by paying cash for the principal value and issuing common stock for any conversion premium; however, after adopting ASU 2020 - 06 , million incremental shares assumed for conversion of convertible notes is required to be included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation, if dilutive, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. Therefore, the Convertible Notes were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if their inclusion was dilutive. The dilutive effect increases the more the market price for the Company's common stock exceeds the conversion price of per share. See Note 10 , Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the Convertible Notes.

Repurchases under the programs may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including derivative transactions, and may be made under a Rule 10 b 5 - 1 plan.

The following table presents the Company's revenues disaggregated by segment and region. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. The Company believes disaggregation by segment and region best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The disaggregation of revenues by segment and region is based on management's assessment of segment performance together with allocation of financial resources, both capital and operating support costs, on a segment and regional level. Both segments and regions benefit from synergies achieved through concentration of operations and are influenced by macro-economic, regulatory and political factors in the respective segment and region.

 3 The Money Transfer Segment provides global money transfers and currency exchange information in retail stores, apps, and websites through Ria Money Transfer, Xe and the Dandelion cross-border real-time payments network.

We have 35 principal offices in Europe, 14 in Asia Pacific, 10 in North America, three in the Middle East, two in South America and three in Africa. Our executive offices are located in Leawood, Kansas, USA. With approximat ely 75.3 of our revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, any significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates will likely have a significant impact on our results of operations (for a further discussion, see Item 1 A - Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ). 

SOURCES OF REVENUES AND CASH FLOW 
 Euronet earns revenues and income primarily from ATM management fees, transaction fees, commissions and foreign currency exchange margin. Each operating segment s sources of revenues are described below. EFT Processing Segment Revenues in the EFT Processing Segment, which represented approximately 34 and 31 of total consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are derived from fees charged for transactions made by cardholders on our proprietary network of ATMs, fixed management fees and transaction fees we charge to customers for operating ATMs and processing debit and credit cards under outsourcing and cross-border acquiring agreements, foreign currency exchange margin on DCC transactions, domestic and international surcharge, foreign currency dispensing and other value added services such as advertising, prepaid telecommunication recharges, bill payment, and money transfers provided over ATMs. Revenues in this segment are also derived from cardless payment, banknote recycling, tax refund services, license fees, professional services and maintenance fees for proprietary applicati on software and sales of related hardware. 

25 

epay Segment Revenues in the epay Segment, which represented approximately 26 and 27 of total consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily derived from commissions or processing fees received from mobile phone operators for the processing and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime and commissions earned from the distribution of other electronic content, vouchers, and physical gifts. The proportion of epay Segment revenues earned from the distribution of prepaid mobile phone time as compared with other electronic products has decreased over time, and digital media content now produces approximately 66 of epay Segment revenues. Other electronic content offered by this segment includes digital content such as music, games, and software, as well as other products including prepaid long distance calling card plans, prepaid Internet plans, prepaid debit cards, gift cards, vouchers, transport payments, lottery payments, bill payment, and money transfer. 

Money Transfer Segment Revenues in the Money Transfer Segment, which represented approximately 40 and 42 of total consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, are primarily derived from transaction fees, as well as the margin earned from purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to customers at retail exchange rates. We have a sending agent network in place comprised of agents, customer service representatives, Company-owned stores, primarily in North America, Europe and Malaysia, Ria, and xe branded websites, along with a worldwide network of correspondent agents, consisting primarily of financial institutions in the transfer destination countries. Under the brand "Dandelion", Ria offers payment processing services to third party partners. The Dandelion cross-border payments platform provides financial institutions, fintechs such as digital wallets and banks, and enterprise software companies access to Euronet's money transfer network through an API connection. Sending and correspondent agents each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services, which are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale. 

Corporate Services, Eliminations and Other In addition to operating in our principal operating segments described above, our Corporate Services, Eliminations and Other category includes non-operating activity, certain inter-segment eliminations and the cost of providing corporate and other administrative services to the operating segments, including most share-based compensation expense. These services are not directly identifiable with our reportable operating segments. Opportunities and Challenges The global product markets in which we operate are large and fragmented, which poses both opportunities and challenges for our technology to disrupt new and existing competition. As an organization, our focus is on increasing our market presence through both physical (ATMs, POS terminals, Company stores and agent correspondents) and digital assets and providing new and improved products and services for customers through all of our channels, which may in turn drive an increase in the number of transactions on our networks. Each of these opportunities also presents us with challenges, including differentiating our portfolio of products and services in highly competitive markets, the successful development and implementation of our software products and access to financing for expansion. 1 The EFT Processing Segment opportunities include physical expansion into target markets, developing value-added products or services, increasing high value DCC and surcharge transactions and efficiently leveraging our portfolio of software solutions. Our opportunities are dependent on renewing and expanding our card acceptance, ATM, POS and merchant acquiring services , cash supply and other commercial agreements with customers and financial institutions. Operational challenges in the EFT Processing Segment include obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and sponsorship agreements in markets in which we operate and navigating frequently changing rules imposed by international card organizations, such as Visa and Mastercard , that govern ATM interchange fees, direct access fees and other restrictions. Our profitability is dependent on the laws and regulations that govern DCC transactions, specifically in the E.U., as well as the laws and regulations of each country in which we operate. These laws and regulations may impact our cross-border and cross-currency transactions . The timing and amount of revenues in the EFT Processing Segment is uncertain and unpredictable due to inherent limitations in managing our estate of ATMs. Our ATM estate is dependent on contracts that cover large numbers of ATMs, and management is complicated by legal and regulatory considerations of local countries, as well as customers' decisions whether to outsource ATMs. Inflationary pressure may impact our business as travelers have less cash available to spend on vacations. 

26 

2 The epay Segment opportunities include renewing existing and negotiating new agreements in target markets in which we operate, primarily with digital content providers, mobile operators, financial institutions and retailers. The overall growth rate in the digital media content and prepaid mobile phone markets shifts between prepaid and postpaid services, and our market share in those respective markets will have a significant impact on our ability to maintain and grow the epay Segment revenues. There is significant competition in these markets that may impact our ability to grow organically and increase the margin we earn and the margin that we pay to retailers. The profitability of the epay Segment is dependent on our ability to adapt to new technologies that may compete with POS distribution of digital content and prepaid mobile airtime, as well as our ability to leverage cross-selling opportunities with our EFT and Money Transfer Segments. The epay Segment opportunities may be impacted by government-imposed restrictions on retailers and/or content providers with whom we partner in countries in which we have a presence, and corresponding licensure requirements mandated upon such parties to legally operate in such countries. 

3 The Money Transfer Segment opportunities include expanding our portfolio of products and services to new and existing customers around the globe, which in turn may lead to an increase in transaction volumes. The opportunities to expand are contingent on our ability to effectively leverage our network of bank accounts for digital money transfer delivery, maintaining our physical agent network, cross selling opportunities with our EFT and epay Segments and our penetration into high growth money transfer corridors. The challenges inherent in these opportunities include maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements, maintaining all required licenses, ensuring the recoverability of funds advanced to agents and the continued reliance on the technologies required to operate our business. The volume of transactions processed on our network is impacted by shifts in our customer base, which can change rapidly with worker migration patterns and changes in unbanked populations across the globe. Foreign regulations that impact cross-border migration patterns and the money transfer markets can significantly impact our ability to grow the number of transactions on our network. For all segments, our continued expansion may involve additional acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services. Our ability to effectively manage our growth has required us to expand our operating systems and employee base, particularly at the management level, which has added incremental operating costs. An inability to continue to effectively manage expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations. Inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies, as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace. Recently, inflation has been increasing our cost structure in many parts of the world in which we operate.

Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates Our revenues and local expenses are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities, and then are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes; therefore, amounts we earn outside the U.S. are negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar and positively impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar. If significant, in our discussion we will refer to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in our comparison of operating segment results. To provide further perspective on the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the following table shows the changes in values relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies of the countries in which we have our most significant operations:

Interest income Interest income was 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 2.5 million or 63 compared to the same period in 2023 . Interest income was 18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 8.0 million or 79 compared to the same period in 2023 . This increase was driven by an increase in interest rates on our interest bearing bank accounts. 

Interest expense 

 Interest expense was 24.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 9.2 million or 61 compared to the same period in 2023 . Interest expense was 59.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 20.1 million or 51 compared to the same period in 2023 . This increase was driven by an increase in interest rates and outstanding balances on our Credit Facility and uncommitted credit facilities. 

 Foreign currency exchange loss, net Foreign currency exchange activity includes gains and losses on certain foreign currency exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of each of our subsidiaries give rise to foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses that result from remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are recorded in net income. 

 We recorded net foreign currency exchange income of 27.4 million and 16.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to net foreign currency exchange loss of 8.8 million and 3.6 million for the same periods in 2023 . These realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses reflect the fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of the countries in which we operated during the respective period. 

Other gains (losses) 

We recorded other gains of 16.5 million and 17.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to no gain and a loss of (0.1) million for the same periods in 2023 . These other gains in 2024 relate to a discrete non-cash investment gain. 

INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 The Company's effective income tax rate was 27.3 and 30.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 29.2 and 30.6 for the same periods ended September 30, 2023 . The Company's effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the applicable statutory income tax rate of 21 as a result of certain foreign earnings being subject to higher local statutory tax rates and the Company s U.S. deferred tax activity.

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EURONET Net income attributable to Euronet was 151.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 47.3 million or 45 compared to t he same period in 2023 . Net income attributable to Euronet was 260.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 50.4 million or 24 compared to t he same period in 2023 . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 Working capital As of September 30, 2024 , we had working capital of 914.6 million , which is calculated as the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities, compared to working capital of 1,462.1 million as of December 31, 2023 . The decrease in working capital was primarily due to the net effect of the classification of the convertible debt to current liabilities, additional financing for the ATMs, operational results, acquisitions, repurchases of shares and working capital changes. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.26 and 1.54 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. We require substantial working capital to finance operations. The Money Transfer Segment funds the payout of the majority of our consumer-to-consumer money transfer services before receiving the benefit of amounts collected from customers by agents. Working capital needs increase in order to cover weekends and banking holidays. As a result, we may report more or less working capital for the Money Transfer Segment based solely upon the day on which the reporting period ends. The epay Segment produces positive working capital, some of which is restricted in connection with the administration of its customer collection and vendor remittance activities. In our EFT Processing Segment, we obtain a significant portion of the cash required to operate our ATMs through various cash supply arrangements, the amount of which is not recorded on Euronet's Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, in certain countries, we fund the cash required to operate our ATM network from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, uncommitted credit agreements and cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 805.4 million of our own cash in use or designated for use in our ATM network, which is recorded in ATM cash on Euronet's Consolidated Balance Sheet. ATM cash increased 280.2 million from 525.2 million as of December 31, 2023 to 805.4 million as of September 30, 2024 as a result of the increase in number of active ATMs as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 . The Company has 1,524.1 million of unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1,254.2 million as of December 31, 2023 . Including the 805.4 million of cash in ATMs at September 30, 2024 , we have access to 2,941.8 million in available cash, and 669.8 million available under the Credit Facility.

Operating activity cash flow Cash flows provided by operating activities were 652.5 million f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 52.5 million for the same period in 2023 . The net increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to other working capital fluctuations. Investing activity cash flow Cash flows used in investing activities were 185.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 74.6 million for the same period in 2023 . The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the 91.3 million of cash paid for the acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, w e used 83.0 million for purchases of property and equipment, net of sale proceeds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 69.1 million for the same period in 2023 . 

Financing activity cash flow Cash flows provided by financing activities were 185.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows used by financing activities of 208.3 million for the same period in 2023 . Our borrowing activities on the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of net repayments of 4.5 million compared to net repayments of 333.8 million for the same period in 2023 . The increase in financing activity i s primarily the result of net borrowings of short-term obligations of 404.3 million offset by cash used to repurchase shares of 217.6 million. We received proceeds of 4.5 million and 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, for the issuance of stock in connection with our Stock Incentive Plan. 

Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 

Fluctuations in f oreign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 had a positive impact of 42.1 million and a negative impact of 172.0 million, respectively, on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to the impact of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the euro. 

Other sources of capital Credit Facility - On October 24, 2022, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement (the Credit Facility to increase the facility from 1.03 billion to 1.25 billion and to extend the expiration to October 24, 2027. The revolving credit facility contains a sublimit of up to 250 million, with 150 million committed, for the issuance of letters of credit, a 75 million sublimit both for U.S. dollar swingline loans and for swingline loans in euros or British pounds sterling. The Credit Facility allows for borrowings in British pounds sterling, euro and U.S. dollars. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to increase the Credit Facility by up to an additional 500 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. Fees and interest on borrowings vary based upon the Company's corporate credit rating and will be based, in the case of letter of credit fees, on a margin, and in the case of interest, on a margin over a secured overnight financing rate, as defined in the agreement, with a margin, including the facility fee, ranging from 1.00 to 1.625 or the base rate, as selected by the Company. The applicable margin for borrowings under the credit facility, based on the Company's current credit rating is 1.25 including the facility fee. 

As of September 30, 2024 , we had 533.0 million of borrowings and 47.2 million of stand-by letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. The remaining 669.8 million under the Credit Facility was available for borrowing. 

37 

Convertible debt - On March 18, 2019, we completed the sale of 525.0 million in principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2049 Convertible Notes ). The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 18, 2019 (the Indenture ), by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Convertible Notes have an interest rate of 0.75 per annum payable semi-annually in March and September and are convertible into shares of Euronet common stock at a conversion price of approximately 188.73 per share if certain conditions are met (relating to the closing prices of Euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods). Holders of the Convertible Notes have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes on each of March 15, 2025, 2029 , 2034 , 2039 and 2044 at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we recorded 12.8 million in debt issuance costs, which are being amortized through March 1, 2025. 

Senior Notes - On May 22, 2019, we completed the sale of 600 million 669.9 million) aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that expire on May 2026 (the Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 1.375 per year, payable annually in arrears on May 22 of each year, until maturity or earlier redemption. As of September 30, 2024 , we have outstanding 600.0 million 668.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after February 22, 2026 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 

Uncommitted Credit Agreements 
 On June 26, 2023, the Company entered into an Uncommitted Loan Agreement for 150 million, which expired on June 21, 2024. This loan was a Prime rate loan, a Bloomberg Short-term Bank Yield BSBY rate loan plus 0.95 or bore interest at the rate agreed to by the Bank and the Company at the time a loan was made. The weighted average interest rate from the loan inception date to June 21, 2024, was 6.32 . 
 
 On June 21, 2024, the Company rolled the 150 million Uncommitted Loan Agreement into a new Uncommitted Loan Agreement with a 400 million credit limit on or before September 30, 2024, and a credit limit of 250 million on or after October 1, 2024 for the sole purpose of providing vault cash for ATMs and expires no later than June 20, 2025. The loan had an outstanding balance of 250 million at September 30, 2024. The loan is a Prime Rate Loan, a Daily SOFR Rate Loan plus 1.05 or shall bear interest at the rate agreed to by the Bank and the Borrower at the time such Loan is made. The weighted-average interest rate from loan inception date to September 30, 2024, was 6.30 . 

On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into an Uncommitted Loan Agreement for 300 million, fully drawn and outstanding at September 30, 2024, for the sole purpose of providing vault cash for ATMs, that expires no later than November 30, 2024. The loan is a Prime Rate Loan, a Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loan plus 1.125 or shall bear interest at the rate agreed to by the Bank and the Borrower at the time such Loan is made. The weighted-average interest rate from the loan inception date to September 30, 2024 was 6.39 . 

Other debt obligations Certain of our subsidiaries have available credit lines and overdraft facilities to generally supplement short-term working capital requirements, when necessary. There was 4.8 million outstanding under these other obligation arrangements as of September 30, 2024 . 

Other uses of capital 
 
 Capital expenditures and needs - Total capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 83.0 million . These capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase and installation of ATMs in key under-penetrated markets, the purchase of POS terminals for the epay and Money Transfer Segments, and office, data center and company store computer equipment and software. Total capital expenditures for 2024 are currently estimated to range from approximately 100 million to 120 million. At current and projected cash flow levels, we anticipate that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand and amounts available under our Credit Facility and other existing and potential future financing will be sufficient to meet our debt (including our uncommitted credit facilities), leasing, and capital expenditure obligations. If our capital resources are not sufficient to meet these obligations, we will seek to refinance our debt and/or issue additional equity under terms acceptable to us. However, we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of our debt or other obligations or for the issuance of additional equity. 

38 

Inflation and functional currencies 
 
 Historically, the countries in which we operate have experienced low and stable inflation. Therefore, the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency. T he current inflationary period has put pressure on our results of operations and our financial ition, primarily in the form of increased compensation expense. In addition, we have seen some signs of inflation impacting demand for our products and services by affecting discretionary spend items, such as gaming products, in our epay business, discretionary travel expenditures in EFT, as well as some pressure on send amounts in money transfer. A s a consequence of this inflationary period, w e expect to see increasing expenses forthcoming. We continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate. 
 
 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
 On occasion, we grant guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries, and we sometimes enter into agreements with unaffiliated third parties that contain indemnification provisions, the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement. Our liability under such indemnification provisions may be subject to time and materiality limitations, monetary caps and other conditions and defenses. As of September 30, 2024 , there were no material changes from the disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . To date, we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or parties to whom we have provided guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries and, accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded as of September 30, 2024 . See also Note 15 , Commitments, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our future contractual obligations from the amounts reported within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

39 

ITEM 3 . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 Interest rate risk As of September 30, 2024 , our total debt outstanding, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, was 2,280.8 million . Of this amount, 525.0 million , net of debt discounts, or 23 of our total debt obligations, relates to our contingent Convertible Notes that have a fixed coupon rate. Our 525.0 million outstanding principal amount of Convertible Notes accrue cash interest at a rate of 0.75 of the principal amount per annum. Based on quoted market prices, as of September 30, 2024 , the fair value of our fixed rate Convertible Notes was 514.8 million , compared to a carrying value of 525.0 million . Further, as of September 30, 2024 we had 533.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, or 23 of our total debt obligations. If we were to maintain these borrowings for one year and maximize the potential borrowings available under the revolving credit facility for one year, a 1 100 basis points) increase in the applicable interest rate would result in additional interest expense to the Company of approximately 12.5 million. The carrying values of the Credit Facility approximates fair value because interest as of September 30, 2024 , was based on SOFR that resets at various intervals of less than one year. Additionally, 668.0 million , or 29 of our total debt obligations, relates to Senior Notes having a fixed coupon rate. Our 668.0 million outstanding principal amount of Senior Notes accrue cash interest at a rate of 1.375 of the principal amount per annum. Based on quoted market prices, as of September 30, 2024 , the fair value of our fixed rate Senior Notes was 646.7 million , compared to a carrying value of 668.0 million . An additional 550.0 million, or 24 of our total debt, is related to short-term uncommitted credit agreements. The credit agreements are due within one year and accrue interest at variable rates. The remaining 4.8 million, or 1 of our total debt obligations, is related to borrowings by certain subsidiaries to fund, from time to time, working capital requirements. These arrangements generally are due within one year and accrue interest at variable rates. 

Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 we had approximately 4.0 million of finance leases with fixed payment and interest terms that expire between the years of 2024 and 2028 . 

Our excess cash is invested in instruments with original maturities of three months or less or in certificates of deposit that may be withdrawn at any time without penalty; therefore, as investments mature and are reinvested, the amount we earn will increase or decrease with changes in the underlying short-term interest rates. Foreign currency exchange rate risk For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , approximately 75.3 of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar countries and we expect to continue generating a significant portion of our revenues in countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of countries in which we have significant operations, primarily the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Indian rupee, New Zealand dollar, Malaysian ringgit and Hungarian forint. As of September 30, 2024 , we estimate that a 1 0 fluctuation in these foreign curren cy exchange rates would have the combined annualized effect on reported net income and working capital of approximately 140 million to 150 million . This effect is estimated by applying a 1 0 adjustment factor to our non-U.S. dollar results from operations, intercompany loans that generate foreign currency gains or losses and working capital balances that require translation from the respective functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. Additionally, we have other non-current, non-U.S. dollar assets and liabilities on our balance sheet that are translated to the U.S. dollar during consolidation. These items primarily represent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions in countries other than the U.S. and our Senior Notes. We estimate that a 1 0 fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would have a non-cash impact on total comprehensive income of approximately 100) million to 110 million) as a result of the change in value of these items during translation to the U.S. dollar. For the fluctuations described above, a strengthening U.S. dollar produces a financial loss, while a weakening U.S. dollar produces a financial gain. We believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies. Because a majority of our revenues and expenses are incurred in the functional currencies of our international operating entities, the profits we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar and negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, a significant portion of our debt obligations are in U.S. dollars; therefore, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the amount available for repayment of debt will also increase or decrease. We use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to facilitate foreign currency risk management services by writing derivatives to customers. Derivatives are used to manage the overall market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates; however, we do not perform the extensive record-keeping required to account for the derivative transactions as hedges. Due to the relatively short duration of the derivative contracts, we use the derivatives primarily as economic hedges. Since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards, we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives in earnings in the period of change. 

40 

A majority of our consumer-to-consumer money transfer operations involve receiving and disbursing different currencies, in which we earn a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts to minimize exposure related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in Foreign currency exchange (loss) gain, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024 , we had foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 531.3 million , primarily in Australian dollars, British pounds, Canadian dollars, euros and Mexican pesos, that were not designated as hedges and mature within a few days. 

We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain foreign currency denominated other asset and liability positions. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a notional value of 193.7 million, primarily in euros. For derivative instruments our xe operations write to customers, we aggregate the foreign currency exposure arising from customer contracts, and hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties as part of a broader foreign currency portfolio. The changes in fair value related to the total portfolio of positions are recorded in Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024 , we held foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of 1.1 billion , primarily in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars, that were not designated as hedges and for which the majority mature within the next twelve months. 

See Note 11 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

ITEM 4 . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our executive management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13 a- 15 (b) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024 . Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Change in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 . LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is, from time to time, a party to legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The discussion regarding contingencies in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (unaudited), Note 16, Litigation and Contingencies, to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in this report is incorporated herein by reference. 

 From time to time, the Company is a party to legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company records a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonable estimated. Currently , there are no legal proceeding s or regulatory findings which are both probable that a liability has been incurred and can be reasonably estimated that management believes, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. 

During July 2024, the Company received an adverse judicial decision related to withholding taxes on certain agency relationships in Italy within the Money Transfer Segment, which the Company plans to appeal. The Company completed an assessment and concluded that it is reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred, but not probable. The principal amount of the agent-based withholding tax could be approximately 16.5 million for all open periods.

 Filed herewith. 

 Pursuant to Item 601 (b)( 32 of Regulation S-K, this Exhibit is furnished rather than filed with this Form 10-Q. 

PLEASE NOTE: Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we have filed or incorporated by reference the agreements referenced above as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The agreements have been filed to provide investors with information regarding their respective terms. The agreements are not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or its business or operations. In particular, the assertions embodied in any representations, warranties and covenants contained in the agreements may be subject to qualifications with respect to knowledge and materiality different from those applicable to investors and may be qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules not included with the exhibits. These disclosure schedules may contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements. Moreover, certain representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may have changed after the date of the respective agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in our public disclosures. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements as characterizations of the actual state of facts about us or our business or operations on the date hereof.
