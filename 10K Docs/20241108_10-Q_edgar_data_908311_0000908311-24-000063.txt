 Tenant improvements Lesser of useful life or lease term 
 The fair value of real estate acquired is recorded to acquired tangible assets, consisting primarily of land, land improvements, building and improvements, tenant improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of acquired above-market and below-market leases, in-place leases and ground leases, if any, based in each case on their respective relative fair values. Loan premiums, in the case of above-market rate loans, or loan discounts, in the case of below-market rate loans, are recorded based on the fair value of any loans assumed in connection with acquiring the real estate. 
 Capitalized Project Costs 
 The Company capitalizes project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest expense, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, or construction of a project, while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
 The Company did t recognize any impairment of long-lived assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Note 3).

 million and million, respectively, are presented net of accumulated amortization of million and million, respectively. 
 Reimbursements from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue and are included in rental and other property income in the period the expenses are incurred, with the corresponding expenses included in rental and other property operating expense. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented on a gross basis when the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service and control that specified good or service before it is transferred to the tenant. The Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components as the pattern of revenue recognition does not differ for the two components, and the non-lease component is not the primary component in the Company s leases. 
 In addition to minimum rents, certain leases, including the Company s parking leases with third-party operators, provide for additional rents based upon varying percentages of tenants sales in excess of annual minimums. Percentage rent is recognized once lessees specified sales targets have been met.

 ______________________ 
 (1) Fixed lease payments include contractual rents under lease agreements with tenants recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including amortization of acquired above-market leases, below-market leases and lease incentives.

 and , respectively, across all operating leases. 
 Revenue from lending activities 
 Interest income included in interest and other income is comprised of interest earned on loans and the Company s short-term investments and the accretion of loan discounts. Interest income on loans is accrued as earned with the accrual of interest suspended when the related loan becomes a Non-Accrual Loan (as defined below). 
 Revenue from hotel activities 
 The Company recognizes revenue from hotel activities separate from its leasing activities. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all of the goods or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. Various performance obligations of hotel revenues can be categorized as follows: 
 cancellable and noncancelable room revenues from reservations and 
 ancillary services including facility usage and food or beverage. 
 Cancellable reservations represent a single performance obligation of providing lodging services at the hotel. The Company satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues associated with these reservations over time as services are rendered to the customer. The Company satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues associated with noncancelable reservations at the earlier of (i) the date on which the customer cancels the reservation or (ii) over time as services are rendered to the customer. 
 Ancillary services include facilities usage and providing food and beverage. The Company satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues associated with these services at a point in time when the good or service is delivered to the customer.

 A loan receivable is generally classified as non-accrual (a Non-Accrual Loan if (i) it is past due as to payment of principal or interest for a period of days or more, (ii) any portion of the loan is classified as doubtful or is charged-off or (iii) the repayment in full of the principal and/or interest is in doubt. Generally, loans are charged-off when management determines that the Company will be unable to collect any remaining amounts due under the loan agreement, either through liquidation of collateral or other means. Interest income, included in interest and other income, on a Non-Accrual Loan is recognized on the cost recovery basis.

 . This represents a total CECL reserve transition adjustment of approximately , net of a deferred tax asset. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a total CECL of million and million, respectively. 
 The Company estimates CECL for its loans primarily using its historical experience with loan write-offs, historical charge-offs from third-party firms, and the weighted average remaining maturity method, which has been identified as an acceptable method for estimating CECL reserves in the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Staff Q A Topic 326, No. 1. This method requires the Company to reference historical loan loss data across a comparable data set and apply such loss rate to each loan investment over its expected remaining term, taking into consideration expected economic conditions over the relevant timeframe. The Company considers loans that are both (i) expected to be substantially repaid through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral and (ii) for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, to be collateral-dependent loans. For loans that the Company determines that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, the Company measures the expected losses based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For collateral-dependent loans with respect to which the Company determines foreclosure is not probable, the Company applies a practical expedient to estimate expected losses using the difference between the collateral s fair value (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan. The Company may use other acceptable alternative approaches in the future depending on, among other factors, the type of loan, underlying collateral and availability of relevant historical market loan loss data. 
 Quarterly, the Company evaluates the risk of all loans receivable and assigns a risk rating based on a variety of factors, which are grouped as follows: (i) loan and credit structure, including the as-is loan-to-value LTV ratio and structural features; (ii) quality and stability of real estate value and operating cash flow, including debt yield, dynamics of the geography, local market, physical condition and stability of cash flow; and (iii) quality, experience and financial condition of the borrower. 
 Based on a 5-point scale, the Company s loans receivable are rated 1 through 5, from least risk to greatest risk, respectively, which ratings are defined as follows: 
 1- Acceptable These are assets of high quality; 
 
 2- Other Assets Especially Mentioned OAEM These are assets that are generally profitable but exhibit potential weakness or weaknesses, including, but not limited to, no significant pay history as detailed below for loans originated generally within the last year. Such weaknesses could result in deterioration if not corrected ; 
 
 3- Substandard These assets generally have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses which could hinder collection efforts; 
 
 4- Doubtful These assets have weakness or weaknesses similar to substandard loans; however, the weakness or weaknesses are so extreme that significant loss potential exists in all cases and 
 
 5- Loss Assets assigned this classification have no value and thus have been or are in the process of being charged off.

 The Company has been in discussion with the largest tenant at One Kaiser Plaza in Oakland, California, a property that is secured by a fixed rate mortgage with a balance of million as of September 30, 2024, about renewing a portion of its existing lease.

The Company is exploring whether the lender holding the fixed-rate mortgage on the property will agree to loan concessions relating to such upfront capital costs. If we are not able to receive such concessions, we may elect to cease interest payments on the mortgage, such failure would constitute an event of default under the mortgage and would allow the lender to, among other remedies, declare principal and interest on the mortgage loan to be immediately due and payable.

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

 million in future obligations under leases to fund tenant improvements and other future construction obligations as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, million was funded to reserve accounts included in restricted cash on the Company s consolidated balance sheet for these tenant improvement obligations in connection with the mortgage loan agreement entered into in June 2016. 
 Employment Agreements The Company has an employment agreement with of its officers. Under certain circumstances, this employment agreement provides for (1) severance payment equal to the annual base salary paid to the officer and (2) death and disability payments in an amount equal to times and time, respectively, the annual base salary paid to the officer. 
 Litigation The Company is not currently involved in any material pending or threatened legal proceedings nor, to the Company s knowledge, are any material legal proceedings currently threatened against the Company, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the normal course of business, the Company is periodically party to certain legal actions and proceedings involving matters that are generally incidental to the Company s business. While the outcome of these legal actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, in management s opinion, the resolution of these legal proceedings and actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or the Company s ability to satisfy its debt service obligations or to maintain its level of distributions on Common Stock or Preferred Stock. 
 A subsidiary of the Company is a defendant in a lawsuit in connection with injuries sustained by a third-party contractor at a property previously owned by such subsidiary. Such subsidiary has reached an agreement in principle to settle the lawsuit with the plaintiff pursuant to which such subsidiary s share of the settlement payment will be approximately . The Company anticipates that such payment will be made directly from the Company s insurance carrier, which will be responsible for the entire payment. Accordingly, the Company does not expect this lawsuit to have any adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or the Company ability to satisfy its debt service obligations or to maintain the level of distributions on the Company s Common Stock or Preferred Stock. 
 SBA Related If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced under the SBA 7(a) Small Business Loan Program, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company serviced an aggregate of million of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans. With respect to the guaranteed portion of SBA loans that have been sold, the SBA will first honor its guarantee and then seek compensation from the Company in the event that a loss is deemed to be attributable to technical deficiencies. Based on historical experience, the Company does not expect that this contingency is probable to be asserted. However, if asserted, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or the Company s ability to satisfy its debt service obligations or to maintain its level of distributions on Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

 Executive Summary 
 Business Overview 
 Creative Media Community Trust Corporation is a Maryland corporation and REIT. We primarily acquire, develop, own and operate both premier multifamily properties situated in vibrant communities throughout the United States and Class A and creative office real assets in markets with similar business and employment characteristics to our multifamily investments. We seek to apply the expertise of CIM Group to the acquisition, development and operation of premier multifamily properties and creative office assets that cater to rapidly growing industries such as technology, media and entertainment. All of our real estate assets are and will generally be located in communities qualified by CIM Group as described further below. These communities are located in areas that include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. We believe that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the population growth, public commitment and significant private investment that characterize these areas. 
 CIM is headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, with offices in Atlanta, GA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX, London, UK, New York, NY, Orlando, FL, Phoenix, AZ, and Tokyo, Japan. CIM also maintains additional offices across the United States and in South Korea to support its platform. 
 
 Properties 
 As of September 30, 2024, our real estate portfolio consisted of 27 assets, all of which were fee-simple properties and five of which we own through investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. Our Unconsolidated Joint Ventures contain two office properties (one of which has been partially converted into multifamily units), one multifamily site currently under development, one multifamily property and one commercial development site. As of September 30, 2024, our 13 office properties, totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet, were 72.2 occupied, and our one hotel with an ancillary parking garage, which has a total of 503 rooms, had RevPAR of 145.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and our three multifamily properties were 92.0 occupied. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had nine development sites (three of which were being used as parking lots). 
 Strategy 
 We are a Maryland corporation and REIT. Our portfolio of investments currently consists of premier multifamily, Class A and creative office real assets in vibrant and improving metropolitan communities throughout the United States. We also own one hotel in northern California and a lending platform that originates loans under the Small Business Administration SBA 7(a) loan program. We seek to apply the expertise of CIM Group to the acquisition, development and operation of premier multifamily properties situated in vibrant communities throughout the United States. While we may acquire, develop and operate creative office assets that cater to rapidly growing industries such as technology, media and entertainment in markets with similar business and employment characteristics to our multifamily investments, we intend to increase our focus towards premier multifamily properties. All of our multifamily and creative office assets are and will generally be located in communities qualified by CIM Group as described further below. These communities are located in areas that include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. We believe that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the population growth, public commitment and significant private investment that characterize these areas. 
 Our investments in multifamily and creative office assets may take different forms, including direct equity or preferred investments, real estate development activities, side-by-side investments or co-investments with vehicles managed or owned by CIM Group and/or originating loans that are secured directly or indirectly by properties primarily located in qualified communities Qualified Communities that meet our strategy. Further, we leverage the investor relationships of CIM Group to execute on our investment pipeline using an asset-light approach for certain of our investments. Under this approach, we co-invest with one or more third parties on an asset-level basis by raising capital from such third parties, maintain an economic interest in the asset and, in some cases, earn a management fee and a percentage of the profits. We believe this is a compelling model that is expected to contribute to strong returns on invested capital while reducing risk by reducing our capital outlay. 
 We intend to dispose of assets that do not fit into our strategy over time and opportunistically (i.e., we do not have any specific time frame with respect to such dispositions). Further, as a matter of prudent management, we regularly evaluate each asset within our portfolio as well as our strategy. Such review may result in dispositions when, among other things, we believe

 the proceeds generated from the sale of an asset can be redeployed in one or more assets that will generate better returns, or the market value of such asset is equal to or exceeds our view of its intrinsic value. 
 CIM Group Operations 
 CIM Group believes that a vast majority of the risks associated with acquiring real estate are mitigated by accumulating local market knowledge of the community where the asset is located. As a result, CIM Group typically spends significant resources over a period of between six months and five years evaluating communities prior to making any acquisitions. The distinct districts that CIM Group identifies through this process as targets for acquisitions are referred to as Qualified Communities. Qualified Communities typically have dedicated resources to become, or are currently, vibrant communities where people can live, work, shop and be entertained, all within walking distance or close proximity to public transportation. These areas, which include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, generally have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends, a propensity for growth and support for investment. CIM Group believes that the critical mass of redevelopment in such Qualified Communities creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. CIM Group targets acquisitions of diverse types of real estate assets, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage and mixed-use through CIM Group s extensive network and its current opportunistic activities. 
 CIM Group seeks to maximize the value of its holdings through active onsite property management and leasing. CIM Group has extensive in-house research, acquisition, credit analysis, development, finance, leasing and onsite property management capabilities, which leverage its deep understanding of metropolitan communities to position properties for multiple uses and to maximize operating income. As a vertically-integrated owner and operator, CIM Group has in-house onsite property management and leasing capabilities. Property managers prepare annual capital and operating budgets and monthly operating reports, monitor results and oversee vendor services, maintenance and capital improvement schedules. In addition, they ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. In addition, CIM Group s real assets management committee (the Real Assets Management Committee reviews and approves strategic decisions related to financing strategies and hold/ sell analyses and performance tracking relative to the overall business plan. CIM Group s organizational structure provides for continuity through multi-disciplinary teams responsible for an asset from the time of the original investment recommendation, through the implementation of the asset s business plan, and any repositions or ultimate disposition activities. 
 CIM Group s Investments and Development teams are separate groups that work very closely together on transactions requiring development or redevelopment. While the Investments team is ultimately responsible for acquisition analysis, both the Investments and Development teams perform due diligence, evaluate and determine underwriting assumptions and participate in the development management and ongoing asset management of CIM Group s assets under development. The Development team is also responsible for the oversight and/or execution of securing entitlements and the development/repositioning process. In instances where CIM Group is not the lead developer, CIM Group s in-house Development team continues to provide development and construction oversight to co-sponsors through a shadow team that oversees the progress of the development from beginning to end to ensure adherence to the budgets, schedules, quality and scope of the project in order to maintain CIM Group s vision for the final product. Both the Investments and Development teams interact as a cohesive team when sourcing, underwriting, acquiring, executing and managing the business plan of an opportunistic acquisition. 
 Financing Strategy 
 We may finance our future activities through one or more of the following methods: (i) offerings of shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share Common Stock ), preferred stock or other equity and/or debt securities of the Company; (ii) issuances of interests in our operating partnership in exchange for properties; (iii) credit facilities and term loans; (iv) the addition of senior recourse or non-recourse debt using target acquisitions as well as existing assets as collateral, including the securitization of portions of our loan portfolio; (v) the sale of existing assets; (vi) partnering with co-investors; and/or (vii) cash flows from operations.

Where applicable, annualized rent has been grossed up by adding annualized expense reimbursements to base rent. Annualized rent for certain office properties includes rent attributable to retail. Total abatements, representing lease incentives in the form of free rent, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.8 million and 2.9 million, respectively. Giving effect to abatements, net annualized rent per occupied square foot was 59.52 and 54.64 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (See Definitions for more detail). 
 Over the next four quarters, we expect to see expiring cash rents as set forth in the table below (includes 100 of our properties partially owned through Unconsolidated Joint Ventures):

 Fluctuations in submarkets, buildings and terms of leases cause large variations in these numbers and make predicting the changes in rent in any specific period difficult. Our rental and occupancy rates are impacted by general economic conditions, including the pace of regional and economic growth, and access to capital. Therefore, we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current market rates. Additionally, decreased demand and other negative trends or unforeseeable events that impair our ability to timely renew or re lease space could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or to maintain our level of distributions on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock. 
 Multifamily Statistics: The following table sets forth occupancy rates and the monthly rent per occupied unit across our multifamily portfolio for the specified periods (includes 100 of our property partially owned through an Unconsolidated Joint Venture):

Net of rent concessions granted in the specified period, monthly rent per occupied unit was 2,444 and 2,100 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Hotel Statistics: The following table sets forth the occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for our hotel in Sacramento, California for the specified periods: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Occupancy 71.4 76.9 ADR 203.98 193.84 RevPAR 145.74 149.01 
 Seasonality 
 Our revenues and expenses for our hotel property are subject to seasonality during the year. Generally, our hotel revenues are greater in the first and second quarters than the third and fourth quarters. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenues, segment net operating income, net income and cash provided by operating activities. In addition, the hotel industry is cyclical and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic factors. 
 Lending Segment 
 Through our loans originated under the SBA 7(a) Program, we are a national lender that primarily originates loans to small businesses. We identify loan origination opportunities through personal contacts, internet referrals, attendance at trade shows and meetings, direct mailings, advertisements in trade publications and other marketing methods. We also generate loans through referrals from real estate and loan brokers, franchise representatives, existing borrowers, lawyers and accountants. 
 The SBA 7(a) Loan Program is the SBA s most common loan program. The maximum loan amount for an SBA 7(a) loan is 5.0 million. Key eligibility factors are based on what the business does to generate its income, its credit history, the liquidity of the borrower, size standards and where the business operates. We work with potential borrowers to identify the type of loan that would be appropriate for each such borrower s needs. Our SBA 7(a) term loans have monthly repayment terms of principal and interest and are originated with variable interest rates based on the prime rate. Most of our SBA 7(a) loans have maturities of approximately 25 years. 
 While we have focused on originating real estate loans almost exclusively to the limited service and mid-scale hospitality industry, we intend to increase our efforts to originate other real estate collateralized loans. These loans are anticipated to be primarily concentrated in industries in which we previously had positive experience, including convenience store, RV park and single purpose building owner-occupied restaurant operations and may include owner-occupied industrial operations/warehouse buildings.

 Net loss was 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 6.1 million. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 9.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of 3.6 million in segment net operating income (discussed in more detail in the following Summary Segment Results) . 
 Funds from Operations 
 We believe that funds from operations FFO ), a non-GAAP measure, is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a REIT and that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, which reflects the deduction of redeemable preferred stock dividends accumulated, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, impairment of real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the NAREIT ). 
 Like any metric, FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our real estate properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the NAREIT; accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to the FFOs of other REITs. Therefore, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. 
 The following table sets forth a historical reconciliation of net loss attributable to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net loss attributable to common stockholders (1)

 ______________________ 
 (1) During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 16.1 million and 352,000, respectively, of redeemable preferred stock redemptions. Such amounts are included in, and have the effect of increasing net loss attributable to common stockholders and FFO attributable to common stockholders because redeemable preferred stock redemptions are not an adjustment prescribed by NAREIT.

Table of Contents 

 FFO attributable to common stockholders, which is a non-GAAP measure, was (28.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 20.9 million compared to (7.5) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in FFO was primarily due to an increase in redeemable preferred stock redemptions of 15.7 million, a decrease of 3.6 million in segment net operating income (discussed in more detail in the following Summary Segment Results) and an increase in redeemable preferred stock dividends of 1.2 million . 
 Summary Segment Results 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we operated in four segments: office, hotel and multifamily properties and lending. Set forth and described below are summary segment results for our operating segments (dollar amounts in thousands).

 Revenues 
 Office Revenue: Office revenue includes rental revenue, expense reimbursements and lease termination income from office properties. Office revenue decreased to 13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower occupancy at an office property in Oakland, California, partially offset by higher rental revenues at an office property in Los Angeles, California due to increased occupancy and at an office property in Beverly Hills, California due to higher rent per occupied square foot. 
 Hotel Revenue: Hotel revenue decreased to 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in occupancy for the three

 months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as occupancy was negatively impacted by ongoing construction related to the Hotel Renovation, which began during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to renovate the hotel. 
 Multifamily Revenue: Multifamily revenue was 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to higher rental revenues at our multifamily properties due to increased occupancy and increased monthly rent per occupied unit, net of rent concessions, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Lending Revenue: Lending revenue represents revenue from our lending subsidiaries, including interest income on loans and other loan related fee income. Lending revenue was 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in premium income as a result of higher loan sale volume, partially offset by decreased interest income due to higher loan payoff volume during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (Loss) Income From Unconsolidated Office Entities: The income from our Unconsolidated Joint Ventures included in office segment net operating income decreased to a loss of 834,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the valuation of investments in real estate at our unconsolidated office entities which recognized a net unrealized loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net unrealized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss From Unconsolidated Multifamily Entity: The loss from our Unconsolidated Joint Venture included in the multifamily segment net operating income was 405,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with a loss of 422,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest and Other Income: Interest and other income, which has not been allocated to our operating segments, was 158,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, generally consistent with 220,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Expenses 
 Office Expenses: Office expenses increased to 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance, utilities, and administrative expenses at an office property in Oakland, California and higher repairs and maintenance expenses and real estate tax expense at an office property in Austin, Texas. 
 Hotel Expenses: Hotel expenses increased to 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in room expenses as well as higher utilities, maintenance, and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Multifamily Expenses: Multifamily expenses increased to 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased occupancy, leading to increases in maintenance, cleaning, and other operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Lending Expenses: Lending expenses represent expenses from our lending subsidiaries, including interest expense, general and administrative expenses and fees to related parties. Lending expenses decreased to 2.0 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from the amount of principal repayments on our SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes, partially offset by an increase in current expected credit losses. 
 Asset Management and Other Fees to Related Parties: Asset management fees and other fees to related parties, which have not been allocated to our operating segments, were 515,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 724,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was a result of a reduction in asset management fees related to a decrease in our net asset value, primarily resulting from a reduction in the fair value of our investments in real estate as of the end of 2023. 
 Expense Reimbursements to Related Parties Corporate: The Administrator receives compensation and/or reimbursement for performing certain services for the Company and its subsidiaries. Expense reimbursements to related parties-corporate were 592,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, generally consistent with expenses of 524,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest Expense: Interest expense, which has not been allocated to our operating segments, increased to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding principal balance on our 2022 Credit Facility Revolver for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses, which have not been allocated to our operating segments, were 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in legal fees. 
 Transaction-Related Costs: Transaction costs, which related to potential real estate transactions, were 526,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 38,000 for such costs for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to deferred offering costs that were written off and recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to Common Stock. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in acquired in-place lease intangible assets amortization at multifamily properties located in Oakland, California acquired during the first quarter of 2023, which were fully amortized as of December 31, 2023, partially offset by incremental increases to fixed asset depreciation expense related to the acquired properties. 
 Provision for Income Taxes: Provision for income taxes was 15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 554,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to lower taxable income at our taxable REIT subsidiaries compared to the prior year period.

 Net loss was 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 27.3 million. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 26.7 million , a 2.0 million decrease in transaction-related costs, and an increase of 1.3 million in segment net operating income (discussed in more detail in the following Summary Segment Results) . These were partially offset by a 3.3 million increase in interest expense not allocated to our operating segments . 
 Funds from Operations 
 We believe that funds from operations FFO ), a non-GAAP measure, is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a REIT and that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, which reflects the deduction of redeemable preferred stock dividends accumulated, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, impairment of real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the NAREIT ). 
 Like any metric, FFO should not be used as the only measure of our performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our real estate properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our operating results. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the NAREIT; accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to the FFOs of other REITs. Therefore, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 performance and should not be used as a supplement to or substitute measure for cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.

 ______________________ 
 (1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 17.5 million and 1.0 million, respectively, of redeemable preferred stock redemptions. Such amounts are included in, and have the effect of increasing net loss attributable to common stockholders and FFO attributable to common stockholders because redeemable preferred stock redemptions are not an adjustment prescribed by NAREIT. 
 FFO attributable to common stockholders, which is a non-GAAP measure, was (37.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 21.1 million compared to (16.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in FFO was primarily due to a 16.4 million increase in redeemable preferred stock redemptions and an increase of 5.3 million in redeemable preferred stock dividends as well as a 3.3 million increase in interest expense not allocated to our operating segments. These were partially offset by an increase of 1.3 million in segment net operating income (discussed in more detail in the following Summary Segment Results) and a 2.0 million decrease in transaction-related costs.

 Lending Revenue: Lending revenue represents revenue from our lending subsidiaries, including interest income on loans and other loan related fee income. Lending revenue was 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Income From Unconsolidated Office Entities: The income from our Unconsolidated Joint Ventures included in office segment net operating income decreased to 487,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of 837,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unrealized gain recognized on the value of real estate at one of the unconsolidated office entities recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (Loss) Income From Unconsolidated Multifamily Entity: The loss from our Unconsolidated Joint Venture included in the multifamily segment net operating income was 929,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of 216,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest and Other Income: Interest and other income, which has not been allocated to our operating segments, increased to 472,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 296,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to interest earned on money market accounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Expenses 
 Office Expenses: Office expenses increased to 20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses at our office property in Oakland, California from increased utilities and repairs and maintenance expense. 
 Hotel Expenses: Hotel expenses increased by 4.1 to 21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Multifamily Expenses: Multifamily expenses increased to 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including three full quarters of expense from properties acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 
 Lending Expenses: Lending expenses represent expenses from our lending subsidiaries, including interest expense, general and administrative expenses and fees to related parties. Lending expenses were 5.7 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with expenses of 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. primarily due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from the amount of principal repayments on our SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes and a decrease in allocated payroll expense. 
 Asset Management and Other Fees to Related Parties: Asset management fees and other fees to related parties, which have not been allocated to our operating segments, were 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the SOFR components of interest rates on our variable-rate debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses, which have not been allocated to our operating segments, were 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in non-recurring legal fees. 
 Transaction-Related Costs: Transaction costs were 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was related to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of two multifamily properties in Oakland, California in the first quarter of 2023, which increased these costs in the prior year period. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 46.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in acquired in-place lease intangible assets amortization at multifamily properties located in Oakland, California acquired during the first quarter of 2023, which were fully amortized as of December 31, 2023, partially offset by incremental increases to fixed asset depreciation expense related to the acquired properties. 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate: Gain on sale of real estate of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to the sale of 80 of our interest in an office property in Los Angeles, California. There were no dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes: Provision for income taxes was 573,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 969,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to lower taxable income at our taxable REIT subsidiaries compared to the prior year period. 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the real estate assets owned, occupancy level of our real estate assets, the rental rates achieved through our leases, the occupancy and ADR of our hotel, the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants, and loan related activity. Our cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by fluctuations in operating expenses and other general and administrative costs. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense and other non-cash items of 4.1 million and an increase in net proceeds from the sale of loans of 1.8 million, partially offset by a 7.3 million decrease resulting from a higher level of net working capital used compared to the prior period. 
 Our cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to property acquisitions and dispositions, expenditures for the development or repositioning of properties, capital expenditures and cash flows associated with loans originated at our lending segment. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 68.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions of real estate of 96.7 million and a decrease in cash outlays of 5.8 million related to our investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Partially offsetting the decrease in net cash used in investing activities are 30.3 million in proceeds from the sale of a property to the 4750 Wilshire JV during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by borrowings and capital activities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 61.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of net proceeds from our 2022 Credit Facility and mortgages of 7.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 54.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the issuance of unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes of approximately 54.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a 35.6 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. The aforementioned amounts decreasing net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash redemptions of preferred stock of 74.1 million and a decrease in the payment of deferred debt origination costs of 2.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for the acquisition of assets, development or repositioning of properties (as further described below) (including pre-construction costs such as obtaining entitlements and 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 permits and architectural work), or re-leasing of space in existing properties, capital expenditures, paying interest and principal on current and any future debt financings, SBA 7(a) loan originations, paying distributions on our Preferred Stock and Common Stock and making redemption payments on our Preferred Stock. We may finance our future activities through one or more of the following methods: (i) credit facilities and term loans; (ii) issuances of interests in our operating partnership in exchange for properties; (iii) the addition of senior recourse or non-recourse debt using target acquisitions as well as existing assets as collateral, including the securitization of portions of our loan portfolio; (iv) the sale of existing assets; (v) partnering with co-investors; (vi) offerings of preferred stock or other equity and/or debt securities of the Company; and/or (vii) cash flows from operations. In December 2022, we completed a refinancing of our 2018 credit facility, which was set to mature in October 2023, replacing it with the new facility (the 2022 Credit Facility ). The 2022 Credit Facility included a 56.2 million term loan as well as a revolver that originally allowed the Company to borrow up to 150.0 million, both of which are collectively subject to a borrowing base calculation. The 2022 Credit Facility matures in December 2025 and provides for two one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions being satisfied. On December 23, 2022, the Company announced it would redeem all remaining outstanding shares of its Series L Preferred Stock in cash on January 25, 2023 for a total cost of 83.8 million. The payment for the Series L Redemption was made on January 25, 2023 and was funded by a combination of proceeds from the sale of our Series A1 Preferred Stock, draws on our 2022 Credit Facility, and cash on hand. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs will consist primarily of funds necessary for acquisitions of assets, development or repositioning of properties, or re-leasing of space in existing properties, capital expenditures, paying interest and principal on debt financings, refinancing of indebtedness, SBA 7(a) loan originations, paying distributions on our Preferred Stock or any other preferred stock we may issue, any future repurchase of Common Stock and/or redemption of our Preferred Stock (if we choose, or are required, to pay the redemption price in cash instead of in shares of our Common Stock) and distributions on our Common Stock. Additionally, our outstanding commitments to fund loans were 18.5 million as of September 30, 2024, substantially all of which reflect prime-based loans to be originated by our subsidiary engaged in SBA 7(a) Small Business Loan Program lending. A majority of these commitments have government guarantees of 75 (as the government guarantee has now reverted to 75 and we believe that we will be able to sell the guaranteed portion of these loans in a liquid secondary market upon fully funding these loans. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. To the extent we decide to proceed with development work on any of our development sites (in addition to those discussed below), we will have increased liquidity needs. 
 The 4750 Wilshire Project was substantially completed in September 2024 and leasing has commenced. The total cost of the 4750 Wilshire Project is estimated to be approximately 31.0 million (our share of which is 6.2 million), which was financed by a combination of equity contributions from us and co-investors as well as a mortgage loan from a third-party lender. In connection with the 4750 Wilshire JV, we received cash sales proceeds from the joint venture partners, enhancing our liquidity. Further, we have earned and will continue to earn management fees from co-investors in connection with their co-investment in the 4750 Wilshire Project. As of September 30, 2024, total costs of 27.9 million had been incurred by the 4750 Wilshire JV in connection with the 4750 Wilshire Project. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs include our plan to renovate the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento, California (the Hotel Renovation ), which primarily entails renovating the hotel s guest rooms and corridors and is expected to cost approximately 20.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, 10.6 million of costs had been incurred with respect to the Hotel Renovation, which the Company has started construction as of July 2024, with anticipated completion by the end of 2024. Additionally, an Unconsolidated Joint Venture (the 1910 Sunset JV ), in which we have approximately a 44 ownership interest, has begun construction to build 36 multifamily units on the 1915 Park Avenue land parcel adjacent to the office building (the 1915 Park Project) in Los Angeles, California, which development is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2025 and with an estimated cost of approximately 14.7 million (excluding the land acquisition cost), our share of which will be 6.5 million. The 1910 Sunset JV plans to finance the project through a combination of cash from operations at its office property, additional equity contributions from existing investors, and proceeds from a mortgage loan from a third-party lender (which is in-place but currently has no outstanding borrowings and is subject to additional equity contribution requirements which have not yet been met). As of September 30, 2024, the 1910 Sunset JV had incurred total costs of 4.8 million in connection with the 1915 Park Project. 
 As of each of March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we were not in compliance with a financial covenant under the 2022 Credit Facility. Such non-compliance constituted an event of default under the 2022 credit facility. On May 14, 2024, lenders under the 2022 Credit Facility and us entered into an agreement (the First Modification Agreement pursuant to which the lenders waived such event of default with respect to the test period ending March 31, 2024. Among other restrictions, the First Modification Agreement also prohibits our subsidiaries that own properties that secured the 2022 Credit Facility from making any distributions to its parent entities. On August 7, 2024, lenders under the 2022 Credit Facility and the Company entered into an agreement (the Second Modification Agreement pursuant to which the lenders waived such event of default with respect to the test period ending June 30, 2024. Simultaneously with the execution of the Second Modification

 Agreement, we made a 4.0 million repayment under the 2022 Credit Facility. On October 24, 2024, lenders under the 2022 Credit Facility and us entered into an agreement (the Third Modification Agreement pursuant to which the lenders waived such event of default with respect to the test period ending September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Third Modification Agreement, we will not be able to borrow under the 2022 Credit Facility without the consent of the lenders until certain conditions are satisfied, including delivery of a revised business plan acceptable to the lenders and re-establishing compliance with the financial covenant. Under the Third Modification Agreement, the aggregate commitments under the 2022 Credit Facility were reduced from 206.2 million to 169.3 million. Pursuant to the Third Modification Agreement, the lenders and us agreed that, starting April 1, 2025, excess cash flow generated by the borrowers under the 2022 Credit Facility will be deposited into a collateral account controlled by the administrative agent. The borrowers ability to withdraw funds from the collateral account will be limited to specified uses and subject to certain requirements. In addition, the lenders agreed (i) to modify the borrowing base formula to remove certain limitations on the inclusion of office, retail, flex office/industrial and standalone parking assets and (ii) subject to certain conditions, to release assets relating to the Sacramento Sheraton to facilitate a refinancing of such property. The Third Modification Agreement did not waive compliance with the financial covenant for the test period ending December 31, 2024 or any future period. 
 
 If we breach any financial covenant under the 2022 Credit Facility in the future and are unable to obtain a further waiver from the lenders thereunder with respect to such breach, an event of default would occur under the 2022 Credit Facility, which would allow lenders under the 2022 Credit Facility to, among other remedies, declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, to be immediately due and payable. The occurrence of any future event of default would raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our management plans to address any possible future event of default under the 2022 Credit Facility by entering into new financing arrangements to repay amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility. We are in the process of obtaining refinancing for our hotel in Sacramento, California (the Sheraton Refinancing ). If completed, we intend to use the proceeds of the Sheraton Refinancing to repay part of the amount outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility and to pay for the Hotel Renovation described above. In addition, we are in the process of obtaining refinancing (the Los Angeles Refinancing for three of our properties in Los Angeles, California. If completed, the proceeds of the Los Angeles Refinancing, along with a portion of the proceeds from the Sheraton Refinancing, are anticipated to be in an amount sufficient to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility, with the rest to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company expects that each of the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing will close by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Management believes that its plans to repay amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility are probable based on the following: (1) the we have executed term sheets with the respective lenders under the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angles Refinancing; (2) we expect that both the Los Angeles Refinancing and the Sheraton Refinancing will close by the end of the first quarter of 2025; (3) the favorable loan-to-value ratios LTVs of the properties that are the subject of the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing and (4) our plans and efforts to date to obtain additional financing to be secured by two properties that it owns (in addition to the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing), and the favorable LTVs of these two properties. Management s plans are intended to mitigate the relevant condition that would raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the interim financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is issued. The consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue its operations as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of events described in this paragraph. 
 
 In September 2024, at our option, we redeemed 2,589,606 and 2,167,156 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, in shares of Common Stock and, additionally, we paid holder-requested redemptions of 1,010 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock. We currently plan to continue to satisfy some or all redemption requests submitted by holders of our shares Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock during the fourth quarter of 2024 and are currently evaluating whether we will exercise our right to optionally redeem additional shares of Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock. 
 
 These above measures, taken together, will strengthen our balance sheet, improve liquidity and accelerate our transition towards premier multifamily properties. These actions should also better position the Company to take advantage of opportunities that are expected to arise in a recovering real estate market. 
 
 We may not have sufficient funds on hand or may not be able to obtain additional financing to cover all of our long-term cash requirements. While we will seek to satisfy such needs through one or more of the methods described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our ability to take such actions is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Risk Factors in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. If we cannot obtain funding for our long-term liquidity needs, our assets may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both, which may cause us to sell assets at a time when we would not otherwise do so which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or to maintain our level of distributions on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 Mortgages 
 We have mortgage loan agreements with an outstanding balances of 250.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Our mortgage loans mature on various dates from June 7, 2025 through July 1, 2026, with the two mortgage loans with maturity dates in 2025, each including a 1-year extension option, one of them at the Company s discretion and one subject to certain conditions being met. 
 We have been in discussions with the lender under our variable rate mortgage for Channel House, a multifamily property in Oakland, California, to restructure the terms of the mortgage, as rent payments from the property will likely be insufficient to meet debt service payments under the mortgage. There can be no assurance that such restructuring will occur. If we and the lender under the variable rate mortgage cannot agree on a modification of the mortgage and we fail to make a required monthly debt service payment, such failure would constitute an event of default under the mortgage and the would allow the lender to, among other remedies, declare principal and interest under the mortgage loan to be immediately due and payable. 
 We have also been in discussion with the largest tenant at One Kaiser Plaza in Oakland, California, a property that is secured by a fixed rate mortgage with a balance of 97.1 million as of September 30, 2024, about renewing a portion of its existing lease. This extension would require a sizable capital investment by the Company for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and certain building improvements and may not meet the company s return hurdles. In addition, as previously disclosed, the company has been focused on reducing its traditional office investments. We are exploring whether the lender holding the fixed-rate mortgage on the property will agree to loan concessions relating to such upfront capital costs. If we are unable to receive such concessions, we may elect to cease interest payments, such failure would constitute an event of default under the mortgage and would allow the lender to, among other remedies, declare principal and interest on the mortgage loan to be immediately due and payable. 
 Revolving Credit Facilities 
 In October 2018, we entered into the 2018 revolving credit facility that, as amended, allowed us to borrow up to 209.5 million, subject to a borrowing base calculation. The 2018 revolving credit facility was secured by properties in the Company s real estate portfolio: eight office properties and one hotel property. In December 2022, the Company refinanced its 2018 credit facility and replaced it with a new 2022 Credit Facility, entered into with a bank syndicate, that included a 56.2 million term loan (the 2022 Credit Facility Term Loan as well as a revolver that originally allowed the Company to borrow up to 150.0 million (the 2022 Credit Facility Revolver ), both of which are collectively subject to a borrowing base calculation. The 2022 Credit Facility is secured by properties in the Company s real estate portfolio: six office properties and one hotel property (as well as the hotel s adjacent parking garage and retail property). The 2022 Credit Facility bears interest at (A) the base rate plus 1.50 or (B) SOFR plus 2.60 . As of September 30, 2024, the variable interest rate was 7.53 . The 2022 Credit Facility Revolver is also subject to an unused commitment fee of 0.15 or 0.25 depending on the amount of aggregate unused commitments. The 2022 Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company and the Company is subject to certain financial maintenance covenants. The 2022 Credit Facility matures in December 2025 and provides for two one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, including providing notice of the election and paying an extension fee of 0.15 of each lender s commitment being extended on the effective date of such extension. As of November 1, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, 169.3 million, 169.3 million, and 153.2 million, respectively, was outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility and approximately 0.0, 0.0 and 53.0 million, respectively, was available for future borrowings. 
 For certain event of default under the 2022 Credit Facility, modifications of the 2022 Credit Facility relating to such event of default and steps undertaken by us to address such event of default, please see discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources - General above. 
 Other Financing Activity 
 On March 9, 2023, our lending division completed a securitization of the unguaranteed portion of certain of our SBA 7(a) loans receivable with the issuance of 54.1 million of unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes (with net proceeds of approximately 43.3 million, after payment of fees and expenses in connection with the securitization and the funding of a reserve account and an escrow account). The SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes are collateralized by the right to receive payments and other recoveries attributable to the unguaranteed portions of certain of our SBA 7(a) loans receivable. The SBA 7(a) loan backed notes mature on March 20, 2048, with monthly payments due as payments on the collateralized loans are received. The SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) 30-Day average compounded SOFR plus 2.90 and (ii) prime rate minus 0.35 . As of September 30, 2024, the variable interest rate was 8.15 . We reflect the SBA

 7(a) loans receivable as assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 We have junior subordinated notes with a variable interest rate that resets quarterly based on the three-month SOFR plus 3.51 , with quarterly interest only payments. The junior subordinated balance is due at maturity on March 30, 2035. The junior subordinated notes may be redeemed at par at our option. The aggregate principal balance of the junior subordinated notes was 27.1 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Securities Offerings 
 We conducted a continuous public offering of Series A Preferred Stock from October 2016 through January 2020, where one Series A Preferred Warrant was issued along with each issued share of Series A Preferred Stock. During the tenure of the offering, we issued 4,603,287 Series A Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Warrants and received aggregate net proceeds of 105.2 million after commissions, fees and allocated costs. 
 The Series A Preferred Warrants are exercisable beginning on the first anniversary of the date of their original issuance until and including the fifth anniversary of the date of such issuance. At the time of issuance, the exercise price of each Series A Preferred Warrant was equal to a 15.0 premium to the per share estimated NAV of our Common Stock most recently published and designated as the applicable NAV by us at the time of issuance. However, in accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Warrants, the exercise price of each Series A Preferred Warrant issued prior to the reverse stock split in 2019 (the Reverse Stock Split was automatically adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split and, in the discretion of our Board of Directors, the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of each Series A Preferred Warrant issued prior to the special dividend in 2019 was adjusted to reflect the effect of the Special Dividend. As of September 30, 2024, there were 498,420 Series A Preferred Warrants to purchase 124,605 shares of Common Stock outstanding. 
 From February 2020 through June 2022, we conducted a continuous public offering of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock. From June 2022 through September 2024, the we conducted a public offering with respect to shares of its Series A1 Preferred Stock. We used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes. We have suspended our offering of Series A1 Preferred Stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had issued 12,040,878 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock, 8,251,657 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 56,857 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and received aggregate net proceeds of 459.1 million after commissions, fees and allocated costs. 
 Dividends on and Redemptions of Preferred Stock 
 Holders of Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, if, as and when authorized by our Board of Directors, and declared by us out of legally available funds, cumulative cash dividends on each share as follows: (1) at the of greater of (i) an annual rate of 6.0 of the Series A1 Preferred Stock Stated Value (i.e., the equivalent of 0.3750 per share per quarter) and (ii) the Federal Funds (Effective) Rate for such quarter and plus 2.5 of the Series A1 Preferred Stock Stated Value divided by four, up to a maximum of 2.5 of the Series A1 Preferred Stock Stated Value per quarter, (2) 5.50 of the Series A Preferred Stock Stated Value (i.e., the equivalent of 0.34375 per share per quarter), and (3) 5.65 of the Series D Preferred Stock Stated Value (i.e., the equivalent of 0.35313 per share per quarter), respectively. 
 We expect to pay dividends on the Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock in arrears on a monthly basis, unless our results of operations, our general financing conditions, general economic conditions, applicable requirements of the MGCL or other factors make it imprudent to do so. The timing and amount of dividends declared and paid on our Preferred Stock will be determined by our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, and may vary from time to time. 
 From the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock may require us to redeem such shares at a discount to the Series A1 Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stated Value and Series D Preferred Stated Value, respectively. From and after the fifth anniversary of the date of original issuance of any share of our Preferred Stock, we generally (subject to certain conditions) have the right (but not the obligation) to redeem, and the holder of such share may require us to redeem, such share at a redemption price equal to 100 of the stated value of such share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends in respect of such share as of the effective date of the redemption. The redemption price in respect of any share of Preferred Stock, whether redeemed at our option or at the option of a holder, may be paid in cash or in shares of Common Stock in our sole discretion. As of September 30, 2024, we redeemed 4,480,262 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 2,773,657 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock, and 8,410 shares of Series D Preferred Stock.

In September, the Company (at its option) redeemed 2,589,606 shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock, all of which were paid in shares of Common Stock, including all accrued and unpaid dividends as of each redemption date and, in addition, in September 1,010 shares redeemed at the option of the holders were paid in shares of Common stock, including all accrued and unpaid dividends as of the redemption date (collectively the Series A1 In-Kind Redemptions ). The Series A1 In-Kind Redemptions resulted in the aggregate issuance of 32,998,865 shares of Common Stock, all of which were issued in September 2024. 
 Of the 4,480,262 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been redeemed, the redemption of 2,313,106 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were paid in cash (all of which were redeemed at the option of the holders).

 Dividends on Common Stock 
 Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends, if, as and when authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by us out of legally available funds. In determining our dividend policy, the Board of Directors considers many factors including the amount of cash resources available for dividend distributions, capital spending plans, cash flow, our financial position, applicable requirements of the MGCL, any applicable contractual restrictions, and future growth in NAV and cash flow per share prospects. Consequently, the dividend rate on a quarterly basis does not necessarily correlate directly to any individual factor. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Our recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our future income, cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flows from our floating rate debt or the fair values of our fixed rate debt. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (including our variable rate mortgages payable subject to interest rate cap agreements and excluding premiums, discounts, and deferred loan costs), 250.7 million (or 52.1 and 250.7 million (or 52.7 of our debt, respectively, was fixed rate borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (excluding our variable rate mortgages payable subject to interest rate cap agreements as well as premiums, discounts and deferred loan costs), 230.8 million (or 47.9 and 224.7 million (or 47.3 ), respectively, was floating rate borrowings. Based on the level of floating rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a 50 basis point change in SOFR would result in an annual impact to our earnings of approximately 1.2 million and 1.1 million, respectively. We calculate interest rate sensitivity by multiplying the amount of floating rate debt by the respective change in rate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had one interest rate cap agreement outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of 87.0 million and an aggregate fair value of the net derivative asset of 65,000. As of September 30, 2024, an increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the derivative asset.

 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded, as of that time, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 PART II 
 Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently involved in any material pending or threatened legal proceedings nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings currently threatened against us, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the normal course of business, we are periodically party to certain legal actions and proceedings involving matters that are generally incidental to our business. While the outcome of these legal actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, in management s opinion, the resolution of these legal proceedings and actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or to maintain our level of distributions on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 or our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Following discussions with our independent registered public accounting firm, we have included in the notes to our financial statements an explanatory paragraph indicating that the occurrence of any future event of default under our 2022 Credit Facility that is not waived by lenders thereunder would raise substantial doubt about our ability continue as a going concern. 
 If the Company breaches any financial covenant under the 2022 Credit Facility in the future and is unable to obtain a further waiver from the lenders thereunder with respect to such breach, an event of default would occur under the 2022 Credit Facility, which would allow lenders under the 2022 Credit Facility to, among other remedies, declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, to be immediately due and payable. The occurrence of any future event of default would raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to address any possible future event of default under the 2022 Credit Facility by entering into new financing arrangements to repay amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility. The Company is in the process of obtaining refinancing for the Company s hotel in Sacramento, California (the Sheraton Refinancing ). If completed, the Company intends to use the proceeds of the Sheraton Refinancing to repay part of the amount outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility and to pay for the Hotel Renovation described below. In addition, the Company is in the process of obtaining refinancing (the Los Angeles Refinancing for three of its properties in Los Angeles, California. If completed, the proceeds of the Los Angeles Refinancing, along with a portion of the proceeds from the Sheraton Refinancing, are anticipated to be in an amount sufficient to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility, with the rest to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company expects that each of the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing will close by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 
 We may not be able to complete the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing on terms acceptable to us or on the timeline necessary to repay amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility prior to an event of default thereunder. 
 Our ability to complete each of the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing will depend upon market conditions, prevailing economic and competitive conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, while we are in the process of obtaining new financing for each of the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing, the transactions remain subject to completion of final due diligence by lenders thereunder and finalization of definitive documentation, and there can be no assurance that we will enter into such definitive documentation or complete the refinancings on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to complete each of the Sheraton Refinancing and the Los Angeles Refinancing and as a result do not have sufficient funds to repay the amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility and the Company breaches a financial covenant thereunder and is unable to obtain a further waiver from the lenders thereunder, the lenders under the 2022 Credit Facility may, among other remedies, declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, to be immediately due and payable. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 In May 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a repurchase program of up to 10.0 million of the Company s Common Stock (the SRP ). Under the SRP, the Company, in its discretion, may purchase shares of its Common Stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of purchases of shares will depend on a number of factors, including the price and availability of shares, trading volume and general market conditions. The SRP has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There were no repurchases

 Section 7.7 Indemnification . 
 A. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Partnership shall indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney s fees and other reasonable legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Partnership Actions as set forth in this Agreement in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise provided , however , that the Partnership shall not indemnify an Indemnitee (i) if the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the Action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty (ii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, if the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful or (iii) for any transaction for which such Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or otherwise, in violation or breach of any provision of this Agreement and provided , further , that no payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made by the Partnership to indemnify or advance funds to any Indemnitee (x) with respect to any Action initiated or brought voluntarily by such Indemnitee (and not by way of defense) unless (I) approved or authorized by the General Partner or (II) incurred to establish or enforce such Indemnitee s right to indemnification under this Agreement, and (y) in connection with one or more Actions or claims brought by the Partnership or involving such Indemnitee if such Indemnitee is found liable to the Partnership on any portion of any claim in any such Action. 
 Without limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise, for any indebtedness of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership (including, without limitation, any indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.7 in favor of 
 49 

any Indemnitee having or potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. It is the intention of this Section 7.7.A that the Partnership shall indemnify each Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law and this Agreement. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this Section 7.7.A. The termination of any proceeding by conviction of an Indemnitee or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent by an Indemnitee, or an entry of an order of probation against an Indemnitee prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that such Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section 7.7.A with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, and neither the General Partner nor any other Holder shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this Section 7.7. 
 B. To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding or otherwise subject to or the focus of or is involved in any Action shall be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership as incurred by the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of the Action upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in Section 7.7.A has been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met. 
 C. The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled as set forth in any agreement, as approved by a vote of the Partners, or as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee unless otherwise provided in a written agreement with such Indemnitee or in the writing pursuant to which such Indemnitee is indemnified. 
 D. The Partnership may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of any of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership s activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 
 E. Any liabilities which an Indemnitee incurs as a result of acting on behalf of the Partnership, the General Partner or the REIT Limited Partner or any of their respective Affiliates (whether as a fiduciary or otherwise) in connection with the operation, administration or maintenance of an employee benefit plan or any related trust or funding mechanism (whether such liabilities are in the form of excise taxes assessed by the IRS, penalties assessed by the U.S. Department of Labor, restitutions to such a plan or trust or other funding mechanism or to a participant or beneficiary of such plan, trust or other funding mechanism, or otherwise) shall be 
 50 

treated as liabilities or judgments or fines under this Section 7.7, unless such liabilities arise as a result of (i) an act or omission of such Indemnitee that was material to the matter giving rise to the Action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty (ii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, an act or omission that such Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe was unlawful or (iii) any transaction in which such Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or otherwise, in violation or breach of any provision of this Agreement or applicable law. 
 F. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Holders to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement, and any such indemnification shall be satisfied solely out of the assets of the Partnership. 
 G. An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 
 H. The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the Partnership s liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 
 I. It is the intent of the parties that any amounts paid by the Partnership to the General Partner or the REIT Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be treated as guaranteed payments within the meaning of Code Section 707(c) and shall not be treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Partners Capital Accounts. 
 J. The Partnership shall indemnify each Limited Partner and its Affiliates, their respective directors, trustees, officers, stockholders and any other individual acting on its or their behalf, from and against any costs (including costs of defense) incurred by it as a result of any litigation or other proceeding in which any Limited Partner is named as a defendant or any claim threatened or asserted against any Limited Partner, in either case which relates to the operations of the Partnership or any obligation assumed by the Partnership, unless such costs are the result of intentional harm or gross negligence on the part of, or a breach of this Agreement by, such Limited Partner provided , however , that no Partner shall have any personal liability with respect to the foregoing indemnification, any such indemnification to be satisfied solely out of the assets of the Partnership. 
 K. Any obligation or liability whatsoever of the General Partner which may arise at any time under this Agreement or any other instrument, transaction, or undertaking contemplated hereby shall be satisfied, if at all, out of the assets of the General Partner or the Partnership only. 
 51 

No such obligation or liability shall be personally binding upon, nor shall resort for the enforcement thereof be had to, any of the General Partner s managers, members, officers, employees, advisors or agents, regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract, tort or otherwise. 
 Section 7.8 Liability of the General Partner . 
 A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither the General Partner nor any of its directors or officers shall be liable or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Partnership, any Partners, or any Assignees for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if the General Partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. 
 B. The Limited Partners agree that (i) the General Partner is acting for the benefit of the Partnership, the Limited Partners and the General Partner s stockholders collectively (ii) the General Partner is under no obligation not to give priority to the separate interests of the General Partner or the stockholders of the General Partner, and any action or failure to act on the part of the General Partner or its directors that gives priority to the separate interests of the General Partner or its stockholders that does not result in a violation of the contract rights of the Limited Partners under this Agreement does not violate the duty of loyalty owed by the General Partner to the Partnership and or its partners and (iii) the General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the Partnership or any Limited Partner in connection with such decisions, except for liability for the General Partner s intentional harm or gross negligence. 
 C. Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in the Act and this Agreement, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its employees or agents. The General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by it in good faith. 
 D. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the General Partner s and its officers and directors liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 
 E. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except for liability for fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence, or pursuant to any express indemnities given to the Partnership by any Partner pursuant to any other written instrument, no Partner shall have any personal liability whatsoever, to the Partnership or to the other Partners, or for the debts or liabilities of the Partnership or the Partnership s obligations hereunder, and the full recourse of the other Partner(s) shall be limited to the interest of that Partner in the Partnership. Without limitation of the foregoing, and except for liability for fraud, willful misconduct or gross 
 52 

negligence, or pursuant to any such express indemnity, no property or assets of any Partner, other than its interest in the Partnership, shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedures for the satisfaction of any judgment (or other judicial process) in favor of any other Partner(s) and arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement. This Agreement is executed by the officers of the General Partner solely as officers of the same and not in their own individual capacities. 
 F. To the extent that, under applicable law, the General Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or the Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. 
 G. Whenever in this Agreement the General Partner is permitted or required to make a decision in (i) its sole and absolute discretion or discretion or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the General Partner shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest or factors affecting the Partnership or the Partners or any of them, or (ii) in its good faith or under another expressed standard, the General Partner shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or by relevant provisions of law or in equity or otherwise. If any question should arise with respect to the operation of the Partnership, which is not otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement or the Act, or with respect to the interpretation of this Agreement, the General Partner is hereby authorized to make a final determination with respect to any such question and to interpret this Agreement in such a manner as it shall deem, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be fair and equitable, and its determination and interpretations so made shall be final and binding on all parties. The General Partner s sole and absolute discretion and discretion under this Agreement shall be exercised consistently with the duty of care and the obligation of good faith and fair dealing under the Act (as modified by the Agreement). 
 H. To the maximum extent permitted under the Act, the only duties that the General Partner owes to the Partnership, any Partner or any other Person (including any creditor of any Partner or assignee of any Partnership Interest), fiduciary or otherwise, are to perform its contractual obligations as expressly set forth in this Agreement consistently with the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and to act with the fiduciary duties of care and loyalty which have been, in accordance with the Act, modified as set forth in this Section 7.8. The General Partner, in its capacity as such, shall have no other duty, fiduciary or otherwise, to the Partnership, any Partner or any other Person (including any creditor of any Partner or any assignee of Partnership Interest). The provisions of this Agreement other than this Section 7.8 shall create contractual obligations of the General Partner only, and no such provision shall be interpreted to expand or modify the fiduciary duties of the General Partner under the Act. The provisions of this Section 7.8, to the extent that they restrict or modify the duties and liabilities of the General Partner under the Act or otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of such General Partner. The General Partner is entitled to a presumption that any act or failure to act on the part of the General Partner, and 
 53 

any decision or determination made by the General Partner, is presumed to satisfy the duties of the General Partner under the Act, modified as set forth in this Section 7.8, and no act or failure to act on the part of the General Partner, or decision or determination made by the General Partner (whether with respect to a change of control of the Partnership or otherwise) shall be subject to any duty, standard of conduct, burden of proof or scrutiny, whether at law or in equity, other than as set forth in this Section 7.8. 
 Section 7.9 Other Matters Concerning the General Partner . 
 A.

 D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any non-mandatory provision of the Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable in order (i) to protect the ability of CMCT or the REIT Limited Partner to qualify as a REIT, (ii) for CMCT or the REIT Limited Partner otherwise to satisfy the REIT Requirements, (iii) for CMCT or the REIT Limited Partner to avoid incurring any taxes under Code Section 857 or Code Section 4981, or (iv) for any REIT Limited Partner Affiliate or any Affiliate of CMCT to qualify as a qualified REIT subsidiary (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) or taxable REIT subsidiary (within the meaning of Code Section 856(l)), is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners and does not violate the duty of loyalty or any other duty or obligation, fiduciary or otherwise, of the General Partner to the Partnership or any other Partner. 
 Section 7.10 Title to Partnership Assets .

Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership and (iii) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

 A. an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) four and nine-tenths percent (4.9 of the REIT Partner s total gross income (but excluding the amount of any REIT Payments and any amounts excluded from gross income pursuant to Section 856(c) of the Code) for the Partnership Year that is described in subsections (A) through (I) of Code Section 856(c)(2) over (b) the amount of gross income (within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(2)) derived by the REIT Partner from sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (I) of Code Section 856(c)(2) (but not including the amount of any REIT Payments and any amounts excluded from gross income pursuant to Section 856(c) of the Code) or

To the extent that REIT Payments may not be made in a Partnership Year as a consequence of the limitations set forth in this Section 15.12, such REIT Payments shall carry over and shall be treated as arising in the following Partnership Year if such carry over does not adversely affect the REIT Partner s ability to qualify as a REIT , provided , however , that any such REIT Payment shall not be carried over more than three Partnership Years, and any such remaining payments shall no longer be due and payable.

It is the intention of the Partners that the rights of the parties hereto and their successors-in-interest to Partnership property, as among themselves, shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, and that the rights of the Partners and their respective successors-in-interest shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions as set forth in this Agreement. 
 Section 15.14 No Third-Party Rights Created Hereby . The provisions of this Agreement are solely for the purpose of defining the interests of the Holders, inter se and no other person, firm or entity (i.e., a party who is not a signatory hereto or a permitted successor to such signatory hereto including, without limitation, a creditor of the Partnership or any Partner or other third party having dealings with the Partnership) shall have any right, power, title or interest by way of subrogation or otherwise, in and to the rights, powers, title and provisions of this Agreement.

None of the rights or obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership shall be deemed an asset of the Partnership for any purpose by any creditor or other third party, nor may any such rights or obligations be sold, transferred or assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by the Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the Partnership or any of the Partners. 
 83
