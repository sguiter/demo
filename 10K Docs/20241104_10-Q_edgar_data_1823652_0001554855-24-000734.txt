 2024 Private Placement 
 
 On June 28, 2024 an d July 12, 2024, the Company entered into subscription agre ements, warrant a greements, and warrant exchange agreements with certain investors relating to a private placement (the 2024 Private Placement for (i) the issuance and sale of newly issued shares of common stock of the Company, par value per share, for cash at a purchase price of per share (of which, shares were purchased and issued to Embraer), (ii) the issuance of shares of common stock of the Company in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of certain warrants to acquire an aggregate of shares of common stock of the Company, and (iii) the issuance of certain Penny Warrants to acquire an aggregate of shares of common stock of the Company (of which, were issued to Embraer . The common stock issued has the same rights as the existing common stock issued and outstanding. Refer to Note 8 for more information regarding the warrants related to the 2024 Private Placement. The transactions contemplated by the 2024 Private Placement closed on July 2, 2024, July 5, 2024, July 18, 2024, and September 4, 2024. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds of million.

share of common stock at an exercise price of per share, to be exercised only for a whole number of shares of our common stock. The Public Warrants are exercisable provided that we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or we permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement) and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. The Public Warrants expire after the consummation of the Company's business combination on May 9, 2022 Closing or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. We may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants at a price of per warrant, if the last sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a trading days period ending on the third business day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 
 In connection with the 2024 Private Placement, investors agreed to cancel Public Warrants in exchange for shares of common stock of the Company. As of September 30, 2024 , there were Public Warrants outstanding. 
 New Warrants 
 The Company has entered into warrant agreements with certain strategic private investment in public equity investors Strategic PIPE Investors ), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions of each applicable warrant agreement. The Company has issued or has agreed to issue to the Strategic PIPE Investors warrants (the New Warrants to purchase an aggregate amount of (i) shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share Penny Warrants ), (ii) shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share, and (iii) shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share. Warrants with exercise prices of per share are defined as Market Warrants. 
 
 In connection with the 2024 Private Placement, Penny Warrants were issued contingent upon first type certification for the eVTOL in compliance with certain airworthiness authorities. These new Penny Warrants are included in the definition of New Warrants. Additionally, another investor agreed to cancel warrants with an exercise price of in exchange for shares of common stock of the Company. 
 
 Because the cash received for the common stock and New Warrants is significantly different from their fair value, management considers such warrants to have been issued other than at fair market value. Accordingly, such warrants represent units of account separate from the shares of common stock that were issued to the Strategic PIPE Investors in connection with their respective investment and therefore require separate accounting treatment. 
 
 Terms related to the issuance and exercisability of the New Warrants differ among the Strategic PIPE Investors and each New Warrant is independently exercisable such that the exercise of any individual warrant does not depend on the exercise of another. As such, management has concluded that all New Warrants meet the criteria to be legally detachable and separately exercisable and therefore freestanding. 

The New Warrants were issued or issuable to the following types of parties: 

(a) Potential customers : Market and Penny Warrants issued or issuable to potential customers were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718 , Compensation-Stock Compensation, for classification and measurement and ASC 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for recognition. In accordance with ASC 718 , these warrants were determined to be equity-classified. Market Warrants issued at Closing vested immediately and have no contingencies. The Penny Warrants can be separated into categories: (i) contingently issuable warrants (the Contingent Warrants and (ii) warrants that immediately vested upon Closing Vested Warrants ). The Contingent Warrants are measured at fair value on the grant date and will be recognized as variable consideration (a reduction of revenue) under ASC 606 when and if there are related revenue transactions or as expense if there are not yet related revenue transactions. The Vested Warrants were accounted for akin to a non-refundable upfront payment to a potential customer and were recognized as expense as the Company has no current revenue or binding contracts in place. 
 (b) Potential suppliers : Penny Warrants issued or issuable to potential suppliers, which are subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions, are accounted for under ASC 718 and were determined to be equity-classified. Under ASC 718, the fair value of these warrants will be recognized as expense as products and/or services are received from the suppliers as if the Company paid cash for the respective transactions. 
 (c) 2024 Private Placement : Penny Warrants issued or issuable to investors that participated in the 2024 Private Placement are contingent upon receipt of the first type certification for the eVTOL and were accounted for under ASC 718. Refer to Note 7 for more information regarding the 2024 Private Placement. 

 For the Contingent Warrants, the issuance and vesting of such warrants occurs upon the achievement of certain milestones, which include, as applicable, (a) receipt of the first type certification for the eVTOL in compliance with certain airworthiness authorities, (b) receipt of the first binding commitment from a third-party to purchase an eVTOL jointly developed by Embraer and a certain Strategic Investor, (c) being a supplier at entry into service, (d) receipt of binding commitments from certain Strategic Investors for an aggregate eVTOLs , (e) the time at which ten vertiports that have been developed or implemented with the services of a certain Strategic Investor have entered operation or are technically capable of entering operation and (f) receipt of services and support agreements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there were New Warrants to purchase an aggregate shares of common stock outstanding. The New Warrants were measured at fair value on the grant date (May 9, 2022), except for cases where there has been a modification, where fair value is remeasured on the modification date. The fair value of Penny Warrants was calculated by subtracting from Company s common stock share price on the grant date or modification date. The Company used a modified Black-Scholes model to value the Market Warrants with an exercise price of . The valuation model utilizes management judgment and pricing inputs from observable and unobservable markets with less volume and transaction frequency than active markets. Significant deviations from these estimates and inputs could result in a material change in fair value. F orfeitures of New Warrants within the scope of ASC 718 are estimated by the Company and reviewed when circumstances change.

Warrants Classified as Liabilities 
 Private Warrants 
 The Company has outstanding warrants issued in private placements (the Private Warrants ), which are recorded in the Derivative financial instruments line of the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Each Private Warrant entitles its holder to purchase share of common stock at an exercise price of per share, subject to conditions as defined in the respective warrant agreement. The Private Warrants have similar terms as the Public Warrants, except for the cash redemption feature. However, in the event a Private Warrant is transferred to a third-party not affiliated with the Company (referred to as a non-permitted transferee), the warrant becomes a Public Warrant and is subject to the cash redemption feature. If this occurs, the calculation changes for the settlement amount of the Private Warrants. Since the settlement amount depends solely on who holds the instrument, which is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option or forward on equity shares, the Private Warrants are liability classified. As of September 30, 2024 , there were Private Warrants outstanding. 

million and million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, related to the Private Warrants. The Company uses the share price of its Public Warrants as the input for the recurring fair value measurement of Private Warrants at the end of each reporting period within the Derivative financial instruments line item of the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Public Warrants are used to remeasure the fair value as they have similar key terms. Refer to Note 8 and 10 for additional information. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , a gain of million and a loss of million, respectively, were recognized within the Gain/(loss) from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities line in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The change in fair value is recorded under operating activities within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

Business Models 
 
 Eve plans to fuel the development of the UAM ecosystem by providing a complete portfolio of solutions across three prima ry offerings: 
 
 eVTOL Production and Design. Eve is designing and certifying an eVTOL purpose-built for UAM missions. Eve plans to market its eVTOLs globally to operators of UAM services, including fixed wing and helicopter operators, as well as lessors that purchase and manage aircraft on behalf of operators. 
 
 Service and Operations Solutions. Eve plans to offer a full suite of eVTOL service and support capabilities, including material services, maintenance, technical support, training, ground handling and data services . Services wi ll be offered to UAM fleet operators on an agnostic basis supporting both our own eVTOL aircraft and those produced by third parties. 

Urban Air Traffic Management. Eve is developing Vector, a next-generation UATM software to help enable eVTOLs to operate safely and efficiently in dense urban airspace along with conventional fixed wing and rotary aircraft and unmanned drones. Eve expects to offer Vector primarily as a subscription software offering to customers that include air navigation service providers, fleet operators and vertiport operators. 
 
 To date, Eve has not generated any revenue, as it continues to develop its eVTOL aircraft and other UAM solutions. As a result, Eve will require substantial additional capital to develop products and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until Eve can generate any revenue from product sales and services, it expects to finance operations through a combination of existing cash on hand, public offerings, private placements, and debt financing. The amount and timing of future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of development efforts. 

Key Factors Affecting Operations 
 
 Brazilian Economic Environment 
 
 The Brazilian government has frequently intervened in the Brazilian economy and occasionally made drastic changes in policy and regulations. The Brazilian government s actions to control inflation and affect other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies and incentives, price controls, currency devaluations, capital controls, and limits on imports. Changes in Brazil s monetary, credit, tariff and other policies could adversely affect our business, as could inflation, currency and interest-rate fluctuations, social instability and other political, economic or diplomatic developments in Brazil, as well as the Brazilian government s response to these developments. 
 
 Rapid changes in Brazilian political and economic conditions that have occurred and may occur require continued assessment of the risks associated with our activities and the adjustment of our business and operating strategy accordingly. Developments in Brazilian government policies, including changes in the current policy and incentives adopted for financing exports of Brazilian goods, or in the Brazilian economy, over which we have no control, may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Table of Contents 

Inflation and exchange rate variations have had and may continue to have substantial effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Inflation and exchange rate variations affect our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Brazilian reais. The value of these assets and liabilities as expressed in US Dollars declines when the real devalues against the US Dollar and increases when the real appreciates. In periods of devaluation of the real, we report (i) a remeasurement loss on real-denominated monetary assets and (ii) a remeasurement gain on real-denominated monetary liabilities. For additional information on the effects of exchange rate variations on our financial condition and results of operations, see the section entitled Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Development of the UAM M arket 
 
 Our revenue will be directly tied to the continued development and sale of eVTOL and related services. While we believe the market for UAM will be large, it remains undeveloped and there is no guarantee of future demand. We currently anticipate commercialization of our eVTOL services-and-support business beginning in 2026 , followed by the commercialization and initial revenue generation from the sale of our eVTOLs beginning in 2027. Our business will require significant investment leading up to launching passenger services including, but not limited to, final engineering designs, prototyping and testing, manufacturing, software development, certification, pilot training and commercialization. 

We believe one of the primary drivers for adoption of our UAM services is the value proposition and time savings offered by aerial mobility relative to traditional ground-based transportation. Additional factors impacting the pace of adoption of our UAM services include but are not limited to: perceptions about eVTOL quality, safety, performance and cost; perceptions about the limited range over which eVTOL may be flown on a single battery charge, volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline, availability of competing forms of transportation, such as ground or air taxi or ride-hailing services, the development of adequate infrastructure, consumers perception about the convenience and cost of transportation using eVTOL relative to ground-based alternatives, and increases in fuel efficiency, autonomy, or electrification of cars. In addition, macroeconomic factors could impact demand for UAM services, particularly if end-user pricing is at a premium to ground-based transportation alternatives. We anticipate initial operations in selected high-density metropolitan areas where traffic congestion is particularly acute and operating conditions are suitable for early eVTOL operations. If the market for UAM does not develop as expected, this would impact our ability to generate revenue or grow our business. 

Competition 

We believe that our primary sources of competition are focused UAM developers and established aerospace and automotive conglomerates developing UAM businesses. We expect the UAM industry to be dynamic and increasingly competitive. Our competitors could get to market before us, either generally or in specific markets. Even if we are first to market, we may not fully realize the benefits we anticipate and we may not receive any competitive advantage or may be overcome by other competitors. If new companies or existing aerospace or automotive conglomerates launch competing solutions in the markets in which we intend to operate and obtain large-scale capital investment, we may face increased competition. Additionally, our competitors may benefit from our efforts in developing consumer and community acceptance for UAM products and services, making it easier for them to obtain the permits and authorizations required to operate UAM services. In the event our project experiences substantial delays, or our current or future competitors overcome our advantages, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would be harmed.

Table of Contents 

Government Certification 
 
 We plan to obtain authorizations and certifications for our eVTOL with Brazil's Ag ncia Nacional de Avia o Civil ANAC ), U.S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA ), and European Union Aviation Safety Agency EASA initially and will seek certifications from other aviation authorities as necessary. We will also need to obtain authorizations and certifications related to the production of our aircraft and the deployment of our related services. While we anticipate being able to meet the requirements of such authorizations and certifications, we may be unable to obtain such authorizations and certifications, or to do so on the timeline we project. Should we fail to obtain any of the required authorizations or certifications, or do so in a timely manner, or any of these authorizations or certifications are modified, suspended or revoked after we obtain them, we may be unable to launch our commercial service or do so on the timelines we project, which would have adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 
 Initial Business Development Engagement 
 
 Since its founding, Eve has been engaged in multiple market and business development projects around the world. Examples of this include two concepts of operation CONOPS with Airservices Australia as well as with the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority. Both market and business development initiatives demonstrate Eve s ability to create new procedures and frameworks designed to enable the safe scalability of UAM together with our partners. Using these initiatives as a guide, Eve has launched CONOPS in Rio de Janeiro, Miami, Japan, Chicago and South Korea , and hopes to launch additional concepts of operation in the United States, Brazil, and around the world. 
 
 In addition to our market development initiatives, Eve has signed non-binding letters of intent to sell over 2,870 of our eVTOL aircraft and we continue to seek additional opportunities for sales partnerships. In addition to these deals, Eve has been actively involved in the UAM ecosystem development by signing Memorandums of Understanding MOUs with more than 30 market-leading partners in segments spanning infrastructure, operations, platforms, utilities, and others. In the future, we plan to focus on implementation and ecosystem readiness with our existing partners while continuing to seek UATM and support-services partnerships in order to complement our business model and drive growth. 
 
 Fully Integrated Business Model 
 
 Eve s business model to serve as a fully integrated eVTOL transportation solution provider is uncertain. Present projections indicate that payback periods on eVTOL aircraft will result in a viable business model over the long-term as production volumes scale and unit economics improve to support sufficient market adoption. As with any new industry and business model, numerous risks and uncertainties exist. Our financial results are dependent on certifying and delivering eVTOL on time and at a cost that supports returns at prices that sufficient numbers of customers are willing to pay based on value arising from time and efficiency savings from utilizing eVTOL services. Our aircraft include numerous parts and manufacturing processes unique to eVTOL aircraft, in general and our product design, in particular. Best efforts have been made to estimate costs in our planning projections; however, the variable cost associated with assembling our aircraft at scale remains uncertain at this stage of development. The success of our business is also dependent, in part, on the utilization rate of our aircraft and reductions in utilization will adversely impact our financial performance. Our aircraft may not be able to fly safely in poor weather conditions, including snowstorms, thunderstorms, lightning, hail, known icing conditions and/or fog. Inability to operate safely in these conditions would reduce our aircraft utilization and cause delays and disruptions in our services. We intend to maintain a high daily aircraft utilization rate which is the amount of time our aircraft spend in the air carrying passengers. High daily aircraft utilization is achieved in part by reducing turnaround times at vertiports so we can fly more hours on average in a day. Aircraft utilization is reduced by delays and cancellations from various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, security requirements, air traffic congestion and unscheduled maintenance events.

Research and development expenses 
 Research and development R D activities represent a significant part of the Company s expenses. Research and development efforts focus on the design and development of eVTOLs , the development of service and operations support for its vehicles and those manufactured by third parties, and the development of Vector, a UATM software platform. Research and development expenses consist of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation) for employees focused on research and development activities, fees incurred under the Master Service Agreement (MSA) , equipment and materials, and an allocation of overhead, including rent, information technology costs and utilities. Research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly as the Company increases staffing to support eVTOL aircraft engineering and software development, builds aircraft prototypes, progresses towards the launch of its first eVTOL aircraft, and continues to explore and develop next generation aircraft and technologies. 
 Research and development expenses increased by 3.8 million and 24.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respect ively . The incr ease in research and development expense was primarily driven by the MSA with Embraer who performs several developmental activities for Eve. These efforts continue to intensify with increasing maturity of the development of our eVTOL, including increased engagement of the engineering team who, following the roll-out of our engineering prototype in July 2024, is in the process of performing a series of system and integration ground tests on the aircraft that must be conducted before its debut flight. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation) for employees associated with administrative services such as executive management, business development, legal, human resources, information technology, accounting and finance. These expenses also include certain third-party consulting services, contractor and professional services fees, audit and compliance expenses, insurance costs, corporate overhead costs, depreciation, rent, and utilities. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 3.4 mi llion and 2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to a combination of higher outsourced services and payroll costs. The increase in payroll expenses reflect mostly an increase in Eve s headcount, as well as industrialization and other costs associated with Eve s Brazilian eVTOL manufacturing site, located in the city of Taubat , S o Paulo, Brazil . These increases offset savings on Director Officers insurance expenses. 
 
 Gain/(loss) from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
 
 Derivative liabilities relate to the Private Warrants which are valued using the trading price of the Company s Public Warrants. The g ain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased by 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 20 24, due to a 0.28 decrease in the Public Warrant trading price, whereas the trading price increased 0.06 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The gain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased 2 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 du e to a 0.87 decrease in the Public Warrant trading price, whereas the trading price increased 0.69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Financial investment income 
 The Company invests cash in short fixed-income instruments of low risk, mostly in US Dollar and high-quality financial institutions. Financial investment income incre ased 0.8 million fo r the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to an increase in the average investment balance of 57.3 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Financial investment income decreased 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to a decrease in the average investment balance of 27.3 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the initial draw on the BNDES loan in September 2023. 
 
 Other (loss)/gain, net 
 
 Other loss, net increased 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to an increase in foreign currency losses of 1.6 million and fees and taxes associated with the BNDES loan of 0.6 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other loss, net increased 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to an increase in fees and taxes associated with the BNDES loan of 1.9 million, partially offset by foreign currency gains of 0.3 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company has incurred net losses since inception and to date has not generated any revenue. We expect to continue to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future until we successfully commence sustainable commercial operations. 
 
 The Company received proceeds from the business combination and PIPE Investment of approximately 357.3 million. In addition, in September 2022, the Company received 15.0 million from United Airlines Ventures, Ltd. United ), in connection with a subscription agreement pursuant to which United agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 2,039,353 shares of common stock and a warrant agreement pursuant to which the Company issued to United new warrants to acquire up to 2,722,536 shares of common stock, each with an exercise price of 0.01 per share. 
 
 As previously disclosed, on January 23, 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the Loan Agreement with BNDES, pursuant to which BNDES granted two lines of credit to the Company, with an aggregate amount of R 490 millio n (approximately 94.9 million, u sing the exchange rate on September 30, 2024 ), to support the development of the eVTOL. For additional information about the Loan Agreement, see the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2023. 
 
 On December 21, 2023, the Company announced that Bradesco Bank had concluded that the first line of credit under the Loan Agreement aligned with the 2023 Green Loans Principles, which is a set of guidelines issued for structuring loan operations for sustainable purposes. As of September 30, 2024 , a total of R 360.7 million (approximately 69.6 million) had been issued to the Company pursuant to the Loan Agreement. 
 
 In July and September 2024, the Company closed on subscription agreements, warrant agreements and warrant exchange agreements with certain investors relating to the 2024 Private Placement for the issuance and sale of 23,900,000 newly issued shares of common stock for cash at a purchase price of 4.00 per share, for a total of 95.6 million in new equity financing, the exchange of certain Public Warrants and Market Warrants for shares of common stock, and the issuance of certain Penny Warrants to certain investors. Refer to Note 7 and Note 8 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the Company s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2024 and July 18, 2024 for additional information. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of 24.6 million, financial investments of 255.3 million and available debt to be drawn from the original BNDES loan of 25.3 million , which amounts to approximately 305.2 million of liquidity. Additionally, the new loans were secured in October 2024 from BNDES of approximately 89.6 million and Citibank of 50.0 million, as described in the Recent Developments section of this MD A . Total liquidity is expected to be sufficient to fund our operating plan for at least the next twelve months. 
 Future capital requirements include : 

research and development expenses as we continue to develop our eVTOL aircraft; 

capital expenditures for the expansion of manufacturing capacities; 

additional operating costs and expenses for raw material procurement costs; 

general and administrative expenses as we scale operations; 

interest expense from debt financing ; and 

selling and distribution expenses as we build, brand and market the eVTOL aircraft. 

Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this MD A and Part I, Item 1 A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, some of which are out of our control. Until we generate sufficient operating cash flow to cover operating expenses, working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures, we expect to utilize a combination of equity and debt financing to fund any future capital needs. Currently, no decision has been made as to specific sources of additional funding and the Company may explore different funding opportunities including long-term debt finance lines with private and public banks, advances and pre-delivery down payments from customers, as well as convertible debt. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of common stock. If the Company raises funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of preferred and common stockholders. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The capital markets have experienced in the past, and may in the future experience, periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. The critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are described in Part II, Item 7 . Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Cred it Risk 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and financial investments held subject us to concentrations of credit risk. These financial instruments are held at major financial institutions located in the USA and Brazil. At times, cash balances with any one financial institution may exceed USA s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits 250,000 per depositor per institution). We believe the financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimize credit risk. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2 (a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Section 107 (b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we are not subject to the same implementation timeline for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. 
 We also take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements of emerging growth companies pursuant to the JOBS Act, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. 
 
 We will lose our emerging growth company status and become subject to the SEC s internal control over financial reporting auditor attestation requirements upon the earlier of the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of Zanite s IPO on November 19, 2020, or 1 we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.2 billion, 2 we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer , or 3 the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three- year period.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in the Brazilian interest rate CDI, related to our cash equivalents in Brazil that are invested in Bank Deposit Certificates CDB ), which are issued by financial institutions in Brazil and immediately available for redemption . As of September 30, 2024 , approximately 2 of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and financial investments were indexed to the variation of the CDI rate. 
 
 The CDI rate is an average of interbank overnight rates in Brazil. A risk to financial investment income arises from rate fluctuations in the Brazilian interest rates. 
 
 The interest rates on the loans made available by BNDES are fixed or fixed upon drawing the debt, which will reduce variability of interest expense. 
 
 Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company s liquidity needs. The Company s policy for managing the risk of fluctuations in interest rates on financial investments is to maintain a system to measure market risk, which consists of an aggregate analysis of variety of risk factors that might affect the return of those investments. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 The Company s operations most exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses are those denominated in Brazilian r eais (labor costs, tax issues, local expenses and financial investments) arising from the subsidiary located in Brazil. The relationship of the real to the value of the US Dollar may adversely affect us, mainly due to the fact that 4 of total assets and 19 of total liabilities are in reais . 
 
 The Brazilian real has experienced frequent and substantial var iations in relation to the US Dollar and other foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2024 , the closing exchange rate was 5.4481 reais per US 1.00 . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Control and
Procedures 
 
 The
Company s management is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
financial disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations, disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls
and procedures are met. 
 
 Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 ,
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affec t , our
interna l control over financia l report ing.
