New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Any new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included herein for the period ended March 31, 2024.

The decrease was largely due to an decrease in General and Administrative Expenses. General and Administrative Expenses .

The Company s net loss was (20,342) compared to a net loss of (27,085) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company s net loss was (112,622) compared to a net loss of (190,711) for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 14 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We are an early-stage company and have generated insufficient revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. The Company had 0 in cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2024. The Company has negative working capital of (1,507,226), and total stockholders deficit of (1,507,226) as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to achieve profitable operations in the future, if not, it may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Company s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to maintain profitability. The Company s ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Company s ability to achieve profitable operations. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s), including but not limited to the current outstanding convertible notes. The Company has no committed external source of funds, and there is no guarantee we would be able to raise such funds. The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above. Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities Net cash provided (used) in operating activities was 1,851 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily as a result of net loss from operations during the period. Net cash provided (used) in operating activities was 57,779) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily as a result of net loss from operations during the period. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no accounting standards and interpretations issued which are expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, operations or cash flows.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the material weaknesses described below. Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management concluded that we had material weaknesses (as such term is defined below) in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of the Evaluation Date: 1) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.

A system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 16 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
