 reportable segments: the operation of retail department stores retail operations and a general contracting construction company construction ). For the Company s retail operations segment, the Company determined its operating segments on a store by store basis. Each store s operating performance has been aggregated into reportable segment for financial reporting purposes because stores are similar in each of the following areas: economic characteristics, class of consumer, nature of products and distribution methods. Revenues from external customers are derived from merchandise sales, and the Company does not rely on any major customers as a source of revenue. Across all stores, the Company operates store format under the Dillard s name where each store offers the same general mix of merchandise with similar categories and similar customers. The Company believes that disaggregating its retail operations segment would not provide meaningful additional information.

 While future cash flows under the Citibank Alliance are difficult to predict, the Company expects income from this new alliance to initially be less than historical earnings from the Wells Fargo Alliance. The extent to which future cash flows will vary over the term of the new program from historical cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Gross Margin

Gross margin from retail operations, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 44.5 from 45.3 during the three months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of increased markdowns. Gross margin decreased moderately in home and furniture and ladies apparel, while gross margin decreased slightly in juniors and children s apparel and shoes. Gross margin remained essentially flat in cosmetics and men s apparel and accessories. Gross margin increased slightly in ladies accessories and lingerie. Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 41.6 from 42.0 during the nine months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively. Gross margin from retail operations, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 43.3 from 43.7 during the nine months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively. Gross margin decreased moderately in home and furniture, while gross margin decreased slightly in ladies apparel and shoes. Gross margin remained essentially flat in all other product categories. Total inventory increased 3 at November 2, 2024 compared to October 28, 2023. A 1 change in the dollar amount of markdowns would have impacted net income by approximately 1 million and 4 million for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, respectively. Inflation, trade restrictions, including tariffs, and higher interest rates are a concern for management. The extent to which our business will be affected by these factors depends on our customers continuing ability and willingness to accept higher costs.

During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, the Company recorded proceeds of 6.3 million primarily from the sale of two store properties, resulting in a gain of 6.0 million that was recorded in gain on disposal of assets. Income Taxes The Company s estimated federal and state effective income tax rate was approximately 23.3 and 22.1 for the three months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The Company s estimated federal and state effective income tax rate was approximately 23.3 and 23.0 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the effects of state and local income taxes. The Company expects the fiscal 2024 federal and state effective income tax rate to approximate 19 . This rate includes expected federal and state income tax benefits due to a deduction related to that portion of the special dividend of 25.00 per share to be paid to the Dillard s, Inc. Investment and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. This rate may change if results of operations for fiscal 2024 differ from management s current expectations. Changes in the Company s assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION A summary of net cash flows for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 follows: 

Nine Months Ended November 2, October 28, (in thousands of dollars) 2024 2023 Change Operating activities 349,434 447,107 (97,673) Investing activities (60,162) 7,916 (68,078) Financing activities (117,167) (273,353) 156,186 Total Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 172,105 181,670 (9,565) Net cash flows from operations decreased 97.7 million during the nine months ended November 2, 2024 compared to the nine months ended October 28, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales. In January 2024, the Company announced that it entered into a new agreement with Citibank, N.A. Citi to provide a credit card program for Dillard s customers under the Citibank Alliance, replacing the existing Wells Fargo Alliance. Wells Fargo owned and managed the Dillard s private label cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance, which 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 terminated in September 2024. The Dillard s credit card program offered by Citi includes a new co-branded Mastercard as well as a private label credit card. The new co-branded Mastercard replaced the previous co-branded card. Additionally, Citi provides customer service functions and supports certain Dillard s marketing and loyalty program activities related to the new program. The new program launched on August 19, 2024 for new Dillard s credit applicants. Existing accounts transferred from Wells Fargo to Citi on September 16, 2024. The term of the new Citi agreement is 10 years with automatic extensions for successive two-year terms unless the agreement is terminated by a party in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. The Company recognized income of 37.6 million and 50.9 million during the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively, from the former Wells Fargo Alliance and the Citibank Alliance. Pursuant to the Citibank Alliance, we receive on-going cash compensation from Citi based upon the portfolio s earnings. The compensation received from the portfolio is determined monthly and has no recourse provisions. The amount the Company receives is dependent on the level of sales on Citi accounts, the level of balances carried on Citi accounts by Citi customers, payment rates on Citi accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Citi accounts, the level of credit losses for the Citi accounts as well as Citi s ability to extend credit to our customers. We participate in the marketing of the private label cards, which includes the cost of customer reward programs. While future cash flows under the new program are difficult to predict, the Company expects cash flows from the new program to initially be less than historical cash flows from the Wells Fargo Alliance. The extent to which future cash flows will vary over the term of the new program from historical cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Any material decrease could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. Capital expenditures were 89.1 million and 104.7 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The capital expenditures were primarily related to equipment purchases, the continued construction of new stores and the remodeling of existing stores. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, the Company opened a new location at The Empire Mall in Sioux Falls, South Dakota (140,000 square feet) marking its 30 th state of operation. During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, the Company opened a 100,000 square foot expansion at Gateway Mall in Lincoln, Nebraska. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, the Company closed its Eastwood Mall Clearance Center in Niles, Ohio (120,000 square feet). The Company has also announced the upcoming closure of its leased facility at Stones River Town Centre in Murfreesboro, Tennessee (145,000 square feet). The store is expected to close in January 2025. There were no material costs associated or expected with any of these store closures. We remain committed to closing under-performing stores where appropriate and may incur future closing costs related to such stores when they close. During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, the Company received cash proceeds of 6.3 million and recorded a related gain of 6.0 million, primarily from the sale of two store properties. During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, the Company received proceeds from insurance of 4.5 million primarily from life insurance proceeds related to two policies. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the Company purchased certain treasury bills for 422.4 million and 148.1 million, respectively, that are classified as short-term investments. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the Company received proceeds of 450.9 million and 250.0 million, respectively, related to maturities of these short-term investments. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 980.4 million as of November 2, 2024. The Company maintains a credit facility credit agreement for general corporate purposes including, among other uses, working capital financing, the issuance of letters of credit, capital expenditures and, subject to certain restrictions, the repayment of existing indebtedness and share repurchases. The credit agreement is secured by certain deposit accounts of the Company and certain inventory of certain subsidiaries and provides a borrowing capacity of 800 million, subject to certain limitations as outlined in the credit agreement, with a 200 million expansion option. See Note 7, Revolving Credit Agreement , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I, Item 1 hereof for additional

 information. At November 2, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding, and letters of credit totaling 25.3 million were issued under the credit agreement leaving unutilized availability of 774.7 million. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, the Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of Class A Common Stock at an average price of 364.43 per share for 107.0 million (including the accrual of 2.0 million of share repurchases that had not settled as of November 2, 2024) under the Company s stock repurchase plan. During the nine months ended October 28, 2023, the Company repurchased 0.9 million shares of Class A Common Stock at an average price of 306.41 per share for 265.2 million (including the accrual of 2.0 million of share repurchases that had not settled as of October 28, 2023) under its stock repurchase plans. As of November 2, 2024, 287.0 million of authorization remained under the Company s open stock repurchase plan. The ultimate disposition of the repurchased stock has not been determined. See Note 8, Stock Repurchase Programs , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I, Item 1 hereof for additional information. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("the Act") was signed into law. Under the Act, the Company s share repurchases after December 31, 2022 are subject to a 1 excise tax. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, the Company accrued 1.1 million and 2.6 million, respectively, of excise tax related to its share repurchase programs as an additional cost of treasury shares. On November 21, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special dividend of 25.00 per share. The dividend is payable on the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of the Company on January 6, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 13, 2024. The Company expects to fund the dividend from cash flows from operations. The Company expects to finance its operations during fiscal 2024 from cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and, if necessary, utilization of the credit facility. Depending upon our actual and anticipated sources and uses of liquidity, the Company will from time to time consider other possible financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to fund working capital or for other corporate purposes. There have been no material changes in the information set forth under caption Commercial Commitments in Item 7-Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet arrangements for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating the Company s business. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements or relationships that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or the availability of capital resources. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, actual results could differ from those estimates. For further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Item 7-Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. As of November 2, 2024, there have been no material changes to these critical accounting policies and estimates.
