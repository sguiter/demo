 Assets and Liabilities of Discontinued Operations 
 The Company initially measures assets classified as held for disposition at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less disposal costs. For bulk sale transactions, the unit of account is the disposal group, with any excess of the aggregate carrying value over estimated fair value less costs to sell allocated to the individual assets within the group. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all assets and related liabilities held for disposition relate to discontinued operations and consisted of remaining equity investments excluded from the December 2021 bulk sale of the Company's real estate related investments.

 Principal investments represent acquired interests in InfraBridge funds, valued at their most recent NAV at closing. 
 The intangible assets of InfraBridge were composed of the following: 
 Management contracts were valued based upon estimated net cash flows expected to be generated from the contracts, with remaining term of the contracts ranging between and years, discounted at . 
 Investor relationships represent the fair value of potential future investment management fees, net of operating costs, to be generated from repeat InfraBridge investors in future sponsored vehicles, with a weighted average estimated useful life of years, discounted at . 
 Deferred tax liabilities were recognized for the book-to-tax basis difference of identifiable intangible assets acquired, net of deferred tax assets assumed. 
 Other assets acquired and liabilities assumed include management fee receivable and compensation payable associated with the pre-acquisition period, amounts due to InfraBridge funds and receivable from seller, all of which have largely been settled or relieved. 
 Goodwill is the value of the business acquired that is not already captured in identifiable assets, largely represented by the potential synergies from combining the capital raising resources of DBRG and the mid-market infrastructure specialization of the InfraBridge team.

 Equity Method Investments 
 Principal Investments 
 Principal investments represent investments in the Company's sponsored investment vehicles, accounted for as equity method investments as the Company exerts significant influence in its role as general partner. The Company typically has a small percentage interest in its sponsored funds as general partner or special limited partner. The Company also has additional investment as general partner affiliate alongside the funds' limited partners, primarily with respect to the Company's flagship value-add funds, InfraBridge funds and funds invested in DataBank and Vantage SDC. 
 The Company's proportionate share of net income (loss) from investments in its sponsored investment vehicles, primarily unrealized gain (loss) from changes in fair value of the underlying fund investments, and any distributions received therefrom, are recorded in principal investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Carried Interest Allocation 
 Carried interest allocation represents a disproportionate allocation of returns to the Company, as general partner or special limited partner (which may be paid to the special limited partner entity owned by the Company in place of the general partner entity), based upon the extent to which cumulative performance of a sponsored fund exceeds minimum return hurdles. Carried interest allocation generally arises when appreciation in value of the underlying investments of the fund exceeds the minimum return hurdles, after factoring in a return of invested capital and a return of certain costs of the fund pursuant to terms of the governing documents of the fund. The amount of carried interest allocation recognized is based upon the cumulative performance of the fund if it were liquidated as of the reporting date. Unrealized carried interest allocation is driven primarily by changes in fair value of the underlying investments of the fund, which may be affected by various factors, including but not limited to: the financial performance of the portfolio company, economic conditions, foreign exchange rates, comparable transactions in the market, and equity prices for publicly traded securities. For funds that have exceeded the minimum return hurdle but have not returned all capital to the limited partners, unrealized carried interest allocation may be subject to reversal over time as preferred returns continue to accrue on unreturned capital. Realization of carried interest allocation occurs upon disposition of all underlying investments of the fund, or in part with each disposition. 
 Generally, carried interest allocation is distributed upon profitable disposition of an investment if at the time of distribution, cumulative returns of the fund exceed minimum return hurdles. Depending on the final realized value of all investments at the end of the life of a fund (and, with respect to certain funds, periodically during the life of the fund), if it is determined that cumulative carried interest allocation distributed has exceeded the final carried interest allocation amount earned (or amount earned as of the calculation date), the Company is obligated to return the excess carried interest allocation received. Therefore, carried interest allocation distributed may be subject to clawback if decline in investment values results in cumulative performance of the fund falling below minimum return hurdles in the interim period. If it is determined that the Company has a clawback obligation, a liability would be established based upon a hypothetical liquidation of the net assets of the fund at reporting date. The actual determination and required payment of any clawback obligation would generally occur after final disposition of the investments of the fund or otherwise as set forth in the governing documents of the fund.

 carried interest distributed in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an distribution in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, carried interest of million and million, respectively, were distributed and recognized in carried interest allocations, of which million of the distributed carried interest in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was allocated to current and former employees and to Wafra, recorded as carried interest compensation, other loss, and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests (Note 15). 
 Clawback Obligation 
 The Company did not have a liability for clawback obligations on carried interest distributed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 With respect to funds that have distributed carried interest, if in the event all of their investments are deemed to have no value, all of the carried interest distributed to-date of million would be subject to clawback as of September 30, 2024, of which million would be the responsibility of the employee/former employee recipients and Wafra. For this purpose, a portion of carried interest distributed is generally held back from employees and former employees at the time of distribution. The amount withheld resides in entities outside of the Company. Generally, the Company, through the OP, has guaranteed the clawback obligation of its subsidiaries that act as general partner or special limited partner of its respective sponsored funds, for the benefit of these funds and their limited partners. 
 Marketable Equity Securities 
 Marketable equity securities at September 30, 2024 included securities in a healthcare REIT that was non-traded at December 31, 2023 and became publicly traded through an initial public offering in February 2024. The publicly traded securities in the healthcare REIT have been substantially liquidated following expiration of the underwriters' lock-up in August 2024. 
 Dividends or other distributions from marketable equity securities are recorded in other income, while changes in fair value are recorded in other gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Other Equity Investments 
 Other equity investments include investments warehoused potentially for future sponsored funds and an investment in a managed account. 
 Warehoused investments are generally carried at fair value or under the measurement alternative, which is at cost, adjusted for impairment and observable price changes. Changes in the value of these investments are recorded in other gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Debt Investments 
 Interest income on debt investments is recorded in other income. 
 CLO Subordinated Notes 
 In the third quarter of 2022, bank syndicated loans that the Company previously warehoused were transferred into a 
 third party warehouse entity at their acquisition price, and securitized through the issuance of securities in a collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") structure. The CLO is sponsored and managed by the third party. The Company acquired all of the subordinated notes of the CLO, which are classified as available-for-sale ("AFS") debt securities. 
 In October 2024, the secured notes of the CLO were refinanced, with change in the underlying collateral asset pool. The legal final maturity date, and reinvestment and non-call periods of the CLO were extended by . All of the Company s subordinated notes remain outstanding. The Company received million of excess net proceeds from the refinance as the subordinated note holder, which was applied as a return of capital in October 2024. 
 The stated legal final maturity of the CLO has been extended to 2037. Following the end of the non-call period of the CLO, which is now October 2026, the subordinated notes may be redeemed (in whole, not in part) at the option of the collateral manager or the Company with consent of the collateral manager, if there is sufficient proceeds from sale of collateral assets, including payment of expenses therewith. The redemption price for the subordinated notes is equal to the excess interest and principal proceeds payable at the time of redemption.

Table of Contents 

 December 31, 2023 
 In estimating fair value of the CLO subordinated notes, the Company used a benchmarking approach by looking to the implied credit spreads derived from observed prices on recent comparable CLO issuances, and also considering the current size and diversification of the CLO collateral pool, and projected return on the subordinated notes. Based upon these data points, the Company determined that the issued price of the subordinated notes, net of capital distributions of million and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, was a reasonable representation of its fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 April 2015 Currently redeemable Series I June 2017 Currently redeemable Series J September 2017 Currently redeemable 
 All series of preferred stock are at parity with respect to dividends and distributions, including distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears in January, April, July and October. 
 Each series of preferred stock is redeemable on or after the earliest redemption date for that series at per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) prorated to their redemption dates, exclusively at the Company s option. The redemption period for each series of preferred stock is subject to the Company s right under limited circumstances to redeem the preferred stock upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the articles supplementary relating to each series of preferred stock). 
 Preferred stock generally does not have any voting rights, except if the Company fails to pay the preferred dividends for or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive). Under such circumstances, the preferred stock will be entitled to vote, together as a single class with any other series of parity stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect additional directors to the Company s board of directors, until all unpaid dividends have been paid or declared and set aside for payment. In addition, certain changes to the terms of any series of preferred stock cannot be made without the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each such series of preferred stock voting separately as a class for each series of preferred stock. 
 Common Stock 
 Except with respect to voting rights, class A common stock and class B common stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably in dividends and distributions, and are identical in all respects as to all matters. Class A common stock has vote per share and class B common stock has thirty-six and one-half votes per share.

 Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan 
 The Company's Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (the DRIP Plan provides existing common stockholders and other investors the opportunity to purchase shares (or additional shares, as applicable) of the Company's class A common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on their shares of the Company's class A common stock or making optional cash purchases within specified parameters. The DRIP Plan involves the acquisition of the Company's class A common stock either in the open market, directly from the Company as newly issued common stock, or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties. shares of class A common stock have been acquired under the DRIP Plan in the form of new issuances in the last three years.

 Equity Investments of Consolidated Funds 
 Equity investments of consolidated funds include marketable equity securities held by our liquid strategy funds, valued based upon listed prices in active markets, classified as Level 1; and equity investments in digital infrastructure portfolio companies held by single asset funds. The marketable equity securities comprise publicly listed stocks primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, in Europe, and primarily in the technology, media and telecommunications sectors. The other equity investment, classified as level 3, was valued at September 30, 2024 using a market approach that considers revenue multiples of other comparable companies, and at December 31, 2023, was carried at its recent transacted price. Additionally, at December 31, 2023, fair value of an underlying portfolio company held by single asset funds, prior to deconsolidation of the funds, was determined using a discounted cash flow model based upon projected net operating income of the investee with exit capitalization rate of and discounted at , classified as level 3. 
 In April 2024, the single asset funds were deconsolidated as the Company no longer holds a controlling financial interest in these funds. The Company's co-investment in the portfolio company of the funds was restructured and is no longer held through the funds, but invested in the portfolio company through a parallel vehicle. T he Company's co-investment in the portfolio company is reflected as an equity method investment under the fair value option effective April 2024. The deconsolidation of the funds resulted in a removal of approximately million of net assets attributed to the limited partners of the funds that had represented noncontrolling interests in investment entities. 
 Prior to December 31, 2023, equity investments of consolidated funds included equity interests in pooling entities that hold a portfolio of loans, invested alongside other parallel funds within the same credit fund complex. In December 2023, following a reorganization of the Company's ownership interest within the fund structure, the consolidated credit fund was deconsolidated. Fair value of the fund's equity interests in the pooling entities was based upon its share of expected cash flows from the loan assets held by the pooling entities, classified as level 3. In estimating fair value of the underlying loans, the pooling entities considered the prevailing market yields at which a third party might expect to receive on equivalent loans with similar credit risk. Based upon a comparison to market yields, it was determined that the transacted price or par value of the loans held by the pooling entities approximated their fair value.

 and (weighted average discount rate based upon relative fair value of at September 30, 2024, and using a discount rate of , and also taking into consideration a comparison to market values of similar public companies at December 31, 2023. The fair value is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and changes in fair value are recorded in principal investment income. 
 Loans Receivable 
 There was outstanding loans receivable balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In March 2023, an unsecured promissory note that had been issued in connection with the sale of the Company's former Wellness Infrastructure business in 2022 was written off in the amount of million following the foreclosure of certain assets within the sold Wellness Infrastructure portfolio by its mezzanine lender. 
 Warrants 
 The Company had previously issued warrants to affiliates of Wafra Inc. (collectively "Wafra"), a private investment firm, in connection with Wafra's investment in the Company's investment management business in 2020. Wafra's investment was subsequently redeemed in 2022, with the warrants remaining outstanding. Each warrant entitled Wafra to purchase up to shares of the Company's class A common stock at staggered strike prices between and each, exercisable through July 17, 2026. 
 The terms of the warrant purchase agreement provided for net cash settlement upon exercise of the warrants, at election of either the Company or Wafra, if such exercise would result in Wafra beneficially owning in excess of of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's class A common stock. Inclusion of the cash settlement feature resulted in the warrants being classified as liability. Accordingly, the warrants were carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 In March 2024, of the warrants were reclassified to equity at their prevailing fair value following a removal of the net cash settlement feature, as the terms of the warrants were amended in connection with a sale of the warrants by Wafra to a third party. The equity-classified warrants are no longer subject to fair value remeasurement. 
 At September 30, 2024, the liability-classified warrants were carried at fair value, measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, applying the following inputs: (a) estimated volatility for DBRG's class A common stock of at December 31, 2023); (b) closing stock price of DBRG's class A common stock on the last trading day of the quarter; (c) the strike price for each warrant; (d) remaining term to expiration of the warrants; and (e) risk free rate of per annum per annum at December 31, 2023), derived from the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve rates to correspond to the remaining term to expiration of the warrants. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 In connection with the acquisition of InfraBridge, contingent consideration is payable if prescribed fundraising targets are met. In measuring the contingent consideration at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company applied a probability-weighted approach to the likelihood of meeting various fundraising targets and discounted the estimated future contingent consideration payment at and , respectively, to derive a present value amount, classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 Nonrecurring Fair Values 
 The Company measures fair value of certain assets on a nonrecurring basis: (i) on the acquisition date for business combinations; (ii) when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable; and (iii) upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary for any retained interest. Adjustments to fair value generally result from application of the lower of amortized cost or fair value for assets held for disposition or otherwise, a write-down of asset values due to impairment. 
 At September 30, 2024, certain warehoused investments, previously carried at cost under the measurement alternative, were determined to be impaired and written down to an aggregate fair value of million, classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of these investments were estimated based upon pricing from a recent funding or applying a probability-weighted approach to different recovery outcomes.

 Incentive Fees The Company is entitled to incentive fees from sub-advisory accounts in its liquid securities strategy. Incentive fees are determined based upon the performance of the respective accounts, subject to the achievement of specified return thresholds in accordance with the terms set out in their respective governing agreements. A portion of incentive fees earned by the Company is allocable to certain employees and former employees, included in carried interest and incentive fee compensation expense.

 million shares. 
 Restricted Stock Restricted stock awards in the Company's class A common stock are granted to senior executives, directors and certain employees, subject to a service condition or a combination of both a service and performance condition, with annual time-based vesting in equal tranches, generally over a period. Vesting of performance-based restricted stock awards occur upon achievement of certain Company-specific metrics over a specified performance measurement period. Restricted stock is entitled to dividends declared and paid on the Company's class A common stock and such dividends are not forfeitable prior to vesting of the award. Restricted stock awards are valued based on the Company's class A common stock price on grant date and equity-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
 Restricted Stock Units RSUs in the Company's class A common stock are subject to a performance condition. Vesting of performance-based RSUs occur upon achievement of certain Company-specific metrics over a specified performance measurement period. Only vested RSUs are entitled to accrued dividends declared and paid on the Company's class A common stock during the time period the RSUs are outstanding. RSUs are initially valued based upon the Company's class A common stock price on grant date and not subsequently remeasured for equity-classified awards, while liability-classified awards are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period until the award is fully vested. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period if and when it is probable that the performance condition will be met, subject to reversal if no longer probable. For liability classified awards that met their performance conditions and became fully vested, million of awards were cash settled in 2023, and approximately million of awards are expected to be cash settled.

 to of the number of PSUs granted. For market condition awards, this is determined based upon the performance of the Company's class A common stock over a measurement period relative to a specified peer group (such measurement metric the "relative total shareholder return"). With respect to performance condition awards, vesting is determined based upon achievement of cumulative distributable earnings ("DE") per share targets, and the relative total shareholder return metric is then applied to determine the final number of shares vested. 
 Recipients of PSUs whose employment is terminated after the first anniversary of their PSU grant are eligible to vest in a portion of the PSU award following the end of the measurement period based upon the final number of shares vested for that award. PSUs also contain dividend equivalent rights which entitle the recipients to a payment equal to the amount of dividends that would have been paid on the shares that are ultimately issued at the end of the measurement period. 
 Expected annual dividend yield (2) 
 Risk-free rate (per annum) (3) 
 
 __________ 
 (1) Based upon the historical volatility of the Company's stock and those of a specified peer group. 
 (2) Based upon the Company's expected annualized dividends. Expected dividend yield was for the March 2022 PSU awards as common dividends were suspended beginning the second quarter of 2020 and reinstated in the third quarter of 2022. 
 (3) Based upon the continuously compounded zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield for the term coinciding with the measurement period of the award as of valuation date. 
 Fair value of PSU awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over their measurement period as compensation expense. With respect to performance condition awards, expense recognition occurs only if and when it is probable that the cumulative DE per share targets will be achieved and subject to reversal if no longer probable. In contrast, expense recognized on market condition awards is not subject to reversal even if the total shareholder return metric is not achieved. 
 The dividend equivalent right is accounted for as a liability-classified award. The fair value of the dividend equivalent right is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the measurement period, and is subject to adjustment to fair value at each reporting period. 
 LTIP Units LTIP units are units in the Operating Company that are designated as profits interests for federal income tax purposes. Unvested LTIP units that are subject to market conditions do not accrue distributions. Each vested LTIP unit is convertible, at the election of the holder (subject to capital account limitation), into common OP Unit and upon conversion, subject to the redemption terms of OP Units (Note 8). 
 LTIP units issued have both a service condition and a market condition based upon the Company's class A common stock achieving a target price over a predetermined measurement period, subject to continuous employment to the time of vesting, and valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.

Table of Contents 

 Equity-based compensation cost on LTIP units is recognized on a straight-line basis either over (1) the service period for awards with a service condition only; or (2) the derived service period for awards with both a service condition and a market condition, irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied. The derived service period is a service period that is inferred from the application of the simulation technique used in the valuation of the award, and represents the median of the terms in the simulation in which the market condition is satisfied. 
 Deferred Stock Units Certain non-employee directors may elect to defer the receipt of annual base fees and/or restricted stock awards, and in lieu, receive awards of DSUs. DSUs awarded in lieu of annual base fees are fully vested on their grant date, while DSUs awarded in lieu of restricted stock awards vest from their grant date. DSUs are entitled to a dividend equivalent, in the form of additional DSUs based on dividends declared and paid on the Company's class A common stock, subject to the same restrictions and vesting conditions, where applicable. Upon separation of service from the Company, vested DSUs will be settled in shares of the Company s class A common stock. Fair value of DSUs are determined based upon the price of the Company's class A common stock on grant date and recognized immediately if fully vested upon grant, or on a straight-line basis over the vesting period as equity based compensation expense and equity.

 Warehoused Investments The Company may acquire and temporarily warehouse investments on behalf of prospective sponsored investment vehicles that are actively fundraising (Note 4). The warehoused investments are transferred to the investment vehicle when sufficient third party capital, including debt, is raised. The Company is generally paid a fee by the investment vehicle, akin to an interest charge, typically calculated as a percentage of the acquisition price of the investment, to compensate the Company for its cost of holding the investment during the warehouse period. The terms of such arrangements may differ for each sponsored investment vehicle and by investment.

Ganzi and Jenkins had retained their equity investments and general partner interests in the portfolio companies of DBH, which included, but were not limited to, DataBank and Vantage Data Centers ("Vantage"). Vantage SDC, which the Company has a direct investment in, is a carve out of the stabilized data center portfolio of Vantage's North American business. 
 As a result of the personal investments made by Messrs. Ganzi and Jenkins in DataBank and Vantage prior to the Company s acquisition of DBH, additional investments made by the Company in DataBank and Vantage SDC subsequent to their initial acquisitions may trigger future carried interest payments to Messrs. Ganzi and Jenkins upon the occurrence of future realization events. Such investments made by the Company include ongoing payments for the build-out of expansion capacity, including lease-up of the expanded capacity and existing inventory, in Vantage SDC. 
 With respect to investment vehicles sponsored by the Company for which Messrs. Ganzi and Jenkins are invested in their capacity as former owners of DBH, and not in their capacity as employees of the Company, any carried interest entitlement attributed to such investments by Messrs. Ganzi and Jenkins as general partner are not subject to continuing vesting provisions and do not represent compensatory arrangements to the Company. Such carried interest allocation to Messrs. Ganzi and Jenkins that are unrealized or distributed but unpaid are included in noncontrolling interests on the

 million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Carried interest allocated is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests totaling million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. 
 Investment in Managed Investment Vehicles Subject to the Company's related party policies and procedures, certain employees (who may thereafter become former employees) may invest on a discretionary basis in investment vehicles sponsored by the Company, either directly in the vehicle or indirectly through the Company's general partner entity. These investments are generally not subject to management fees or carried interest, but otherwise bear their proportionate share of other operating expenses of the investment vehicles. Such investments in consolidated investment vehicles and general partner entities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, reflected in redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests on the balance sheet. The employees' and former employees' share of net income was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Such amounts are reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statement of operations and exclude their share of carried interest allocation, which is reflected in incentive fee and carried interest compensation expense. 
 hours of personal travel, which is treated as a compensatory arrangement. Additionally, the Company has agreed to reimburse Mr. Ganzi for a proportional share of the fixed cash costs of any aircraft partially or fully owned by Mr. Ganzi. The fixed cost reimbursements will be made based on an allocable portion of such aircraft s annual fixed cash operating costs, based on the total number of hours the aircraft is used for Company business and personal hours claimed (up to hours annually) divided by the total hours flown. E xpenses incurred on behalf of Mr. Ganzi and expenses reimbursed or are reimbursable to Mr. Ganzi associated with the use of private aircraft (including both aircraft owned by Mr. Ganzi and third party chartered flights) to taled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 reportable segments, that is, Investment Management and Operating. On December 31, 2023 the Operating segment was discontinued following a full deconsolidation of the portfolio companies in the Operating segment, which qualified as discontinued operations (Note 2). 
 At December 31, 2023, subsequent to the discontinuation of the Operating segment, the Company had conducted its business through reportable segment of Investment Management, reflecting the Company's investment management business, which bore only operating costs that were directly attributable or otherwise can be subjected to a reasonable and systematic attribution to the investment management business. Remaining unallocated operating costs, along with corporate level financing and transaction activities, as well as income (loss) from the Company's investment in its sponsored funds as general partner affiliate, and warehoused/seed investments were not attributed to the investment management business and previously presented as Corporate and Other. 
 The segment earnings measure of net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to DigitalBridge Group, Inc. remains consistent with prior periods, except that this measure was previously applied to the Investment Management segment, and beginning 2024, is applied to the Company as a whole. 
 Segment information for all prior periods presented have been conformed to current year presentation.

 Revenues 
 Total revenues were 76.1 million and 262.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 540.9 million and 471.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 186.6 million in the quarter-to-date comparison and increase of 69.8 million in the year-to-date comparison was driven largely by significant variability in carried interest. 
 Excluding carried interest, revenues were higher in both periods under comparison, driven by an increase in fee income of 11.3 million quarter-to-date and 38.0 million year to-date. Principal investment income and other income were lower in 2024, and these decreases largely offset the higher fee revenue in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date comparison. 
 The key components of revenue are discussed in more detail below. 
 Fee Revenue 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Management fees 
 76,011 65,236 10,775 223,542 187,138 36,404 Incentive fees

 Fee revenue increased 11.3 million or 17 in the quarter-to-date comparison and 38.0 million or 20 in the year-to-date comparison, consistent with increase in FEEUM of 4.2 billion or 14 in the 12-month period to 34.1 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Management fees were 10.8 million and 36.4 million higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven by our third flagship fund that held its first close in November 2023, contributing 16.7 million and 39.6 million of fees, respectively (including catch-up fees), as well as additional deployments and commitments in other funds. These increases were partially offset by lower fees in DBP II following a change in fee basis to invested capital and syndication of an investment in 2024, as well as recapitalization of a portfolio company in a co-invest vehicle (aggregate decrease of 6.9 million and 15.9 million, respectively). 
 Higher incentive fees earned in 2024 are attributed to our liquid securities strategy. 
 Carried Interest Allocation (Reversal) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Carried interest allocation Distributed 27,927 (27,927) 118 28,403 (28,285) Unrealized (15,799) 140,964 (156,763) 263,849 164,986 98,863 (15,799) 168,891 (184,690) 263,967 193,389 70,578 
 Carried interest allocation represents gross carried interest from our general partner interests in sponsored investment vehicles prior to allocations to management and Wafra. Unrealized carried interest is subject to adjustments each period, including reversals, based upon the cumulative performance of the underlying investments of these vehicles that are measured at fair value, until such time as the carried interest is distributed. 
 The distributed carried interest in 2023 arose from the recapitalization of DataBank. 
 In the quarter-to-date comparison, 2024 included a reversal of unrealized carried interest, while a large unrealized carried interest was recognized in 2023, attributed primarily to DBP funds and a DataBank investment that was not subject to recapitalization. 
 In the year-to-date comparison, unrealized carried interest was higher in 2024, driven by DBP funds and partially offset by a reversal of carried interest in DataBank funds.

 Principal Investment Income 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Principal investment income Realized 2,647 2,647 13,193 13,193 Unrealized 7,308 17,943 (10,635) 15,589 51,914 (36,325) 9,955 17,943 (7,988) 28,782 51,914 (23,132) 
 Principal investment income represents the Company's proportionate share of net income (loss) from investments in its sponsored investment vehicles, which is predominantly unrealized gain (loss) from changes in fair value of underlying fund investments. 
 Realized principal investment income in 2024 arose largely from gains related to syndication of investments in DBP funds and distribution of interest income. Additionally, the year-to-date period included 4.2 million of previously escrowed proceeds received from the partial sale of our interest i n DataBank in prior years. 
 However, in both the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods, the realized income in 2024 was more than offset by lower unrealized income from fair value decreases or lower fair value increases in underlying investments of other funds. 
 Other Income 
 Other income decreased 5.2 million in the quarter-to-date comparison and 15.7 million in the year-to-date comparison. In 2023, there was higher interest income from our subordinated notes in a collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") and money market deposits, and dividend income from our credit fund which was deconsolidated in the fourth quarter of 2023 (aggregate effect of 4.8 million and 18.2 million, respectively). This was partially offset by incremental costs reimbursable by InfraBridge funds in 2024 that are grossed up as other income and administrative expense 0.9 million and 3.5 million, respectively). 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses were 76.3 million and 159.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 428.7 million and 346.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the changes attributed primarily to significant variability in unrealized carried interest compensation. 
 Excluding incentive fee and carried interest compensation, expenses were lower in both periods under comparison, attributed largely to lower compensation expense, partially offset by higher administrative costs. The year-to-date period also benefited from lower interest expense and transaction costs. 
 Changes in the various expense items are discussed below. 
 Compensation Expense 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Cash and equity-based compensation Cash compensation 34,598 38,776 (4,178) 110,588 111,343 (755) Equity-based compensation 8,828 14,340 (5,512) 35,683 45,801 (10,118) 43,426 53,116 (9,690) 146,271 157,144 (10,873) Incentive fee and carried interest compensation allocation (reversal) (8,474) 72,865 (81,339) 163,242 72,110 91,132 
 Cash and equity-based compensation Cash compensation was 4.2 million lower in the quarter-to-date comparison and 0.8 million lower in the year-to-date comparison, as a result of lower estimated bonus, severance and retention costs (decreased 6.5 million and 5.8 million, respectively), partially offset by the effects of a higher headcount in 2024 to support our growing investment management business. 
 Equity-based compensation was lower in both periods under comparison as 2023 had higher expenses associated with performance-based awards that had achieved their targets. 
 Incentive fee and carried interest compensation allocation The change in compensation expense for both periods is consistent with the change in carried interest, as discussed above.

Table of Contents 

 Administrative and Other Expenses 
 Administrative and other expenses increased 9.5 million in the quarter-to-date comparison and 18.3 million in the year-to-date comparison. In both periods under comparison, the increase can be attributed largely to higher third party professional service costs and also, reimbursable costs from our funds 5.9 million and 11.3 million, respectively) that are grossed up in other income and administrative expense. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 1.4 million in the quarter-to-date comparison and 6.9 million in the year-to-date comparison as a result of the Company's full exchange or redemption of its remaining 5.75 exchangeable senior notes in 2024 (decreased 1.3 million and 3.4 million, respectively). Additionally, interest expense decreased in the year-to-date comparison due to the full repayment of the 200 million 5.00 convertible notes upon maturity in April 2023 3.1 million). 
 Transaction-Related Costs 
 Transaction-related costs increased 0.9 million in the quarter-to-date comparison due to higher unconsummated deal costs, and decreased 7.3 million in the year-to-date comparison as 2023 included higher costs related to the InfraBridge acquisition. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 1.1 million in the quarter-to-date comparison and 2.1 million in the year-to-date comparison, primarily due to management contract intangible assets which have a declining amortization rate over time based upon projected cash flows to be generated from these contracts. 
 Other Gain (Loss), Net 
 Other gain of 47.9 million and 50.8 million was recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 256.4 million and 100.0 million was recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The net gain in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by (i) net fair value increase in investments held by consolidated funds 44.4 million and 46.0 million, respectively), (ii) net gain from partial sale and price changes on our non-core marketable equity securities 6.5 million and 9.3 million, respectively), and (iii) fair value decrease of warrant liability 1.2 million and 4.2 million, respectively), all of which were partially offset by impairment of warehoused investments 8.9 million and 12.5 million, respectively). 
 The net gain in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is mainly attributed to a 278.7 million gain recognized in connection with the deconsolidation of DataBank in September 2023 (of which 3.7 million was realized and 275.0 million unrealized), which was largely offset in the year-to-date period by a 133.3 million write-off of an unsecured promissory note from the 2022 sale of our Wellness Infrastructure business. Both periods in 2023 also included losses related to fair value increase of warrant liability 12.4 million and 23.7 million, respectively), and net decreases in investment values, including those held by our consolidated funds 8.0 million and 16.1 million, respectively). 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 Income tax expense was 0.9 million and 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.1 million and 3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This reflects the income tax expense of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset in year-to-date 2024 by various U.S. state tax refunds. The Company otherwise has operating losses and capital loss carryforwards that can be applied against current income tax expense for its domestic entities, and has established a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of these entities, resulting in no net federal income tax effect for its domestic entities.

 Loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included primarily a loss on a guarantee related to the previous bulk sale of the Company's real estate investments. The loss in 2023 represents primarily the operations of the former Operating segment and 9.7 million impairment of BRSP shares prior to disposition in March 2023, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Operating Metrics 
 Assets Under Management and Fee Earning Equity Under Management 
 We present below our AUM and FEEUM, which are key operating metrics in the alternative investment management industry. Our calculation of AUM and FEEUM may differ from other investment managers, and as a result, may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. 
 Assets Under Management 
 AUM represents the total capital for which we provide investment management services and our general partner capital. AUM is generally composed of third party capital managed by the Company and its affiliates, including capital that is not yet fee earning, or not subject to fees and/or carried interest; and our general partner and general partner affiliate capital committed to our funds. AUM is largely determined based upon invested capital as of the reporting date, including capital funded through third party financing at the underlying portfolio companies; and committed capital for funds in their commitment stage. Our AUM is not based upon any definitions that may be set forth in the governing documents of our managed funds or other investment vehicles, and not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. 
 Fee Earning Equity Under Management 
 FEEUM represents the total capital managed by the Company and its affiliates which earns management fees and/or incentive fees or carried interest. FEEUM is generally based upon committed capital, invested capital, NAV or GAV, pursuant to the terms of each underlying investment management agreement.

 (1) Inflows include closing on new capital raised where fees are earned on committed capital, deployment of capital where fees are earned on invested capital, new subscriptions where fees are based on NAV, other changes in invested capital such as the effect of recapitalization and syndication, and FEEUM from acquired investment vehicles. 
 (2) Outflows include redemptions and withdrawals in Liquid Strategies, realizations where fees are based on invested capital, other changes in invested capital such as the effect of recapitalization and syndication, change in fee basis from committed to invested capital and expiration of fee paying capital. 
 (3) Market activity and other include changes in investment value based on NAV or GAV, and the effect of foreign exchange rates. Amount was less than 100 million in 2024. 
 FEEUM increased 1.3 billion in 2024 to 34.1 billion at September 30, 2024, driven by capital raise for our third flagship fund and deployments in other DBP funds, partially offset by the effects of various recapitalization and syndication of investments. 
 
 Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures 
 We report the following non-GAAP financial measures attributable to the Operating Company: Fee Related Earnings FRE and Distributable Earnings DE ). FRE and DE are common metrics utilized in the investment management sector. 
 We present FRE and DE at the Operating Company level, which is net of amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, composed largely of the limited partners' share of our consolidated funds and Wafra's share of earnings attributed to our general partner interest in certain funds. 
 Beginning in 2024, FRE is reported on a Company-wide basis, consistent with the entirety of the Company's business representing a single reportable segment (as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). Prior to 2024, the Company had reported Investment Management FRE, which was an FRE measure specific to its previously reported Investment Management segment. The Investment Management segment previously bore only operating costs that were directly attributable or otherwise can be subjected to a reasonable and systematic attribution to the Investment Management segment. Company-wide FRE includes all operating costs of the Company as a whole that fall within the definition of FRE. 
 Additionally, Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA is no longer reported as a non-GAAP financial measure in 2024 following the discontinuance of the Operating segment effective December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was previously reported to facilitate an evaluation of the relative contribution of the Company's former Operating segment absent the effect of leverage as the Operating segment had higher leverage relative to the Company's own capital structure. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 We believe the non-GAAP financial measures of FRE and DE supplement and enhance the overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and trends, and facilitate comparison among current, past and future periods and to other companies in similar lines of business. We use FRE and DE in evaluating the Company s ongoing business performance and in making operating decisions. For the same reasons, we believe FRE and DE are useful financial measures to the Company s investors and analysts. 
 As we evaluate profitability based upon continuing operations, these non-GAAP measures exclude results from discontinued operations. DE presented for the 2023 comparative period has been recast to exclude the Operating segment which qualified as discontinued operations on December 31, 2023. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to and not an alternative or in lieu of GAAP net income (loss) as measures of operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities as indicators of liquidity. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may differ from methodologies utilized by other companies for similarly titled performance measures and, as a result, may not be fully comparable to those calculated by our peers. 
 Fee-Related Earnings 
 FRE is used to assess the extent to which direct base compensation and core operating expenses are covered by recurring fee revenues in a stabilized investment management business. FRE represents recurring fee revenue, including incentive fees that are not subject to realization events related to underlying fund investments, net of compensation and administrative expenses. Such expenses generally exclude non-cash equity-based compensation, carried interest compensation, and placement fee expense. Also, consistent with DE, FRE excludes non-core items, and presents costs reimbursable by our managed funds on a net basis (as opposed to a gross-up of other income and administrative costs). Where applicable, FRE is adjusted for Start-Up FRE as defined below. 
 Fee revenues earned from consolidated funds and other investment vehicles are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the fees are funded by and earned from third party investors in these consolidated vehicles who represent noncontrolling interests, our allocated share of net income from the consolidated funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. The elimination of these fees, therefore, does not affect net income (loss) attributable to DBRG. Accordingly, FRE is presented without giving effect to the elimination of fee revenue to the extent such fees meet the definition of FRE. 
 FRE does not include distributed carried interest as these are not recurring revenues and are subject to variability given that they are dependent upon realization events related to underlying fund investments. Placement fees are also excluded from FRE as they are inconsistent in amount and frequency depending upon timing of fundraising for our funds. Other items excluded from FRE include realized principal investment income (loss); and interest, dividend and other income, all of which are not core to the investment management service business. Unlike DE, which is a post-tax measure, FRE does not incorporate the effect of income taxes as it is a pre-tax measure. 
 To reflect a stabilized investment management business, FRE is further adjusted to exclude Start-Up FRE, where applicable. Start-Up FRE is FRE associated with new investment strategies that have 1) not yet held a first close raising FEEUM; or 2) not yet achieved break-even FRE only for investment products that may be terminated solely at the Company s discretion. The Company regularly evaluates new investment strategies and exclude Start-Up FRE until such time a new strategy is determined to form part of the Company s core investment management business. 
 We believe that FRE is a useful measure to investors as it reflects the Company s profitability based upon recurring fee streams that are not subject to realization events related to underlying fund investments, and without the effects of income taxes, leverage, non-cash expenses, income (loss) items that are unrealized and other items that may not be indicative of core operating results in an investment management service business. This allows for better comparability of the Company's profitability on a recurring and sustainable basis and relative to its peers. 
 Distributable Earnings 
 DE generally represents the net realized earnings of the Company and is an indicative measure used by the Company to assess ongoing operating performance and in making decisions related to distributions and reinvestments. Accordingly, we believe DE provides investors and analysts transparency into the measure of performance used by the Company in its decision making. 
 DE is an after-tax measure that reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company s core business by including earnings that are realized and generally excluding non-cash expenses, other income (loss) items that are unrealized and items that may not be indicative of core operating results. This allows the Company, and its investors and analysts, to assess its operating results on a more comparable basis period-over-period. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 Realized earnings included in DE are generally comprised of fee revenue, including all incentive fees, realized principal investment income (loss), distributed carried interest, interest and dividend income. Income (loss) on principal investments is realized when the Company redeems all or a portion of its investment or when the Company receives or is due income such as dividends, interest or distributions of income. 
 The following items are excluded from DE: transaction-related costs; non-core items; other gain (loss); unrealized principal investment income (loss); non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash impairment charges (if any); amortization of deferred financing costs, debt premiums and discounts; our share of unrealized carried interest allocation, net of associated expense; non-cash equity-based compensation costs; and preferred stock redemption gain (loss). 
 Transaction-related costs are incurred in connection with acquisitions, including legal costs post-acquisition, and costs of unconsummated transactions. Non-core items primarily include acquisition-related compensation and certain severance costs, as well as litigation and settlement-related matters, which are presented within compensation expense cash and equity-based, administrative and other expenses, and other gain (loss), net on GAAP income statement. These costs, along with certain other gain (loss) amounts, are excluded from DE as they are related to discrete items, are not considered part of our ongoing operating cost structure, and are not reflective of our core operating performance. 
 Other items excluded from DE are generally non-cash in nature, including income (loss) items that are unrealized, or otherwise do not represent current or future cash obligations such as amortization of deferred financing costs and straight-line lease adjustment. These items are excluded from DE as they do not contribute to the measurement of DE as a net realized earnings measure that is used in decision making related to distributions and reinvestments. 
 Income taxes applied in the determination of DE generally represents GAAP income tax related to continued operations, and includes the benefit of deductions available to the Company on certain expense items excluded from DE (for example, equity-based compensation). As the income tax benefit arising from these excluded expense items do affect actual income tax paid or payable by the Company in any one period, the Company believes their inclusion in DE is appropriate to more accurately reflect amounts available for distribution.

 Fee-Related Earnings . 
 FRE increased 7.8 million, or 42 , to 26.2 million, resulting from continued growth in our investment management business as FEEUM increased 14 from 29.9 billion at September 30, 2023 to 34.1 billion at September 30, 2024. This reflects primarily fee revenue from new capital raised for our third flagship fund, partially offset by decreases in fees in other funds due to change in fee basis, syndications and recapitalizations. Additionally, higher administrative costs were incurred in 2024 in supporting our growing investment management business.

 Distributable Earnings . 
 DE in the third quarter of 2023 of 32.6 million had benefited from 27.9 million of realized carried interest from the recapitalization of DataBank. As a result, notwithstanding a 7.8 million increase in FRE, DE decreased 21.9 million to 10.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.

The expense component is included within compensation expense incentive fees and carried interest allocation (reversal), other gain (loss), and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in investment entities on the GAAP income statement. 
 (4) Adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in investment entities pertain to other gain/loss attributed to limited partners of consolidated funds, and a third party investor's share of principal investment income attributed to our general partner interest in certain sponsored funds. Allocation of unrealized carried interest to management and a third party investor is netted against "unrealized carried interest, net of expense (allocation) reversal" for all periods presented (recasted for periods prior to the second quarter of 2024 when it was previously presented gross in "adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in investment entities"). 
 (5) OP share of discontinued operations represents primarily operating results of portfolio companies consolidated in the former Operating segment prior to 2024, net of associated noncontrolling interests in investment entities. 
 (6) For purposes of DE, 2023 included distributions from a portfolio company in the former Operating segment. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, and anticipated cash needs to fund our business and operations based upon our projected financial performance. Our evaluation of future liquidity requirements is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in internal projections, economic conditions, and other factors as applicable. 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 Liquidity Needs and Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary liquidity needs, both short term and long term, are to fund: 
 our operations, including compensation, administrative and overhead costs; 
 our general partner and general partner affiliate commitments to our investment vehicles; 
 principal and interest payments on our debt; 
 dividends to our preferred and common stockholders; 
 our liability for corporate and other taxes; 
 acquisitions of target investment management businesses; 
 warehouse investments pending the raising of third party capital for future investment vehicles; and 
 obligation for lease payments on our corporate offices. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are: 
 cash on hand; 
 fees received from our investment management business, including our share of distributed net incentive fees and carried interest; 
 cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital, including proceeds from full or partial realization of investments; 
 availability under our Variable Funding Notes ("VFN"); 
 issuance of additional term notes under our corporate securitization; and 
 proceeds from public or private equity and debt offerings. 
 Overview 
 At September 30, 2024, our liquidity position was approximately 427 million, composed of available corporate cash and including the full 300 million under our VFN. Available corporate cash generally represents cash at our OP entity after allocating cash for certain compensatory liabilities, and excludes cash held at subsidiaries of the OP, including cash maintained to satisfy regulatory capital requirements in applicable foreign jurisdictions. 
 We believe we have sufficient cash on hand, and anticipated cash generated from operating activities and availability of external financing sources, to meet our short term and long term liquidity and capital requirements. 
 While we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operational needs, we continuously evaluate alternatives to manage our capital structure and market opportunities to strengthen our liquidity and to provide further operational and strategic flexibility. 
 Significant Liquidity and Capital Activities in 2024 
 We continued to reduce higher cost corporate indebtedness through the full exchange or redemption of the remaining 78.4 million of 5.75 senior notes, which results in annual interest savings of approximately 4.5 million. 
 We settled the remaining 35 million contingent consideration payable to Wafra i n connection with the 2022 redemption of their investment in the Company's investment management business, 50 each in shares of the Company's Class A common stock and in cash. 
 We monetized marketable equity securities that form non-core investments for total net proceeds of 35.0 million. 
 As the subordinated note holder of a third party managed CLO, we received 10.4 million of excess net proceeds from a refinancing of the CLO in October 2024, which we applied as a return of capital. 
 Liquidity Needs and Capital Activities 
 Dividends 
 Common Stock The payment of common stock dividends and determination of the amount thereof is at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 Preferred Stock We have outstanding preferred stock totaling 822 million, bearing a weighted average dividend rate of 7.135 per annum, with aggregate dividend payments of 14.7 million per quarter.

 Investment Commitments 
 Fund Commitments As general partner, we typically have minimum capital commitments to our sponsored funds. With respect to our flagship value-add DBP fund series, and InfraBridge funds, we have made additional capital commitments as a general partner affiliate alongside our limited partner investors. Our fund capital investments further align our interests to our investors. As of September 30, 2024, we have unfunded equity commitments to our unconsolidated funds as general partner and general partner affiliate of 262.5 million (including commitments attributed to the ownership by employees and former employees in the general partner entities). Generally, the timing for funding of these commitments is not known and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to their respective expirations. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 InfraBridge Acquisition In connection with the InfraBridge acquisition in February 2023, contingent consideration of up to AUD 180 million may become payable based upon achievement of future fundraising targets for the third and fourth flagship InfraBridge funds. The current estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is 9.1 million. 
 Warehoused Investments 
 We temporarily warehouse investments on behalf of prospective sponsored investment vehicles that are actively fundraising. The warehoused investments are transferred to the investment vehicle if and when sufficient third party capital, including debt, is raised. Generally, the timing of future warehousing activities is not known. Nevertheless, investment warehousing is undertaken only if it is determined that we will have sufficient liquidity through the anticipated warehousing period. 
 At September 30, 2024, warehoused investments have an aggregate carrying value of 22 million. 
 Carried Interest Clawback 
 Depending on the final realized value of all investments at the end of the life of a fund (and, with respect to certain funds, periodically during the life of the fund), if it is determined that cumulative carried interest distributions have exceeded the final carried interest amount earned (or amount earned as of the calculation date), we are obligated to return the excess carried interest received. Therefore, carried interest distributions may be subject to clawback if a decline in investment values results in the cumulative performance of the fund falling below minimum return hurdles in the interim period. If it is determined that the Company has a clawback obligation, a liability would be established based upon a hypothetical liquidation of the net assets of the fund at reporting date. The actual determination and required payment of any clawback obligation would generally occur after final disposition of the investments of the fund or otherwise as set forth in the governing documents of the fund. 
 If the related carried interest distributions received by the Company are subject to clawback, the previously distributed carried interest would be similarly subject to clawback. The Company withholds a portion of the distribution of carried interest to employees to satisfy their potential clawback obligation. 
 Generally, the Company, through the OP, has guaranteed the clawback obligation of its subsidiaries that act as general partner or special limited partner of its respective sponsored funds, for the benefit of these funds and their limited partners. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had no liability for clawback obligations on distributed carried interest. 
 Lease Obligations 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 45 million of operating lease obligations on our corporate offices, which will be funded through corporate operating cash. The lease obligation amount represents fixed lease payments, excluding any contingent or other variable lease payments, and factor in lease renewal or termination options only if it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.

 Sources of Liquidity 
 Debt Funding 
 As of the date of this filing, we have 300 million of outstanding principal on our corporate debt, as discussed above under " Debt Obligation. " 
 Our securitized financing facility is subject to various covenants, including financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum thresholds for debt service coverage ratio and maximum loan-to-value ratio, as defined. As of the date of this filing, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants, and the full 300 million is available to be drawn on our VFN. 
 Our securitized financing facility allows for the issuance of additional term notes in the future to supplement our liquidity. The decision to enter into a particular financing arrangement is made after consideration of various factors including future cash needs, current sources of liquidity, demand for the Company s debt or equity, and prevailing interest rates. 
 Cash From Operations 
 Fee-Related Earnings We generate FRE from our investment management business, generally encompassing recurring fee revenue net of associated compensation and administrative expenses. Management fee revenue is generally a predictable and stable revenue stream. Our ability to generate new management fee streams through establishing new investment vehicles and raising investor capital depends on general market conditions and availability of attractive investment opportunities as well as availability of debt capital. 
 Incentive Fees Incentive fees, net of employee allocations, are earned based upon the financial performance of a vehicle above a specified return threshold, which is largely driven by appreciation in value of underlying investments. Incentive fees are recognized as fee revenue when they are no longer probable of significant reversal. As investment fair values and changes thereof could be affected by various factors, including market and economic conditions, incentive fees are by nature less predictable in amount and timing. 
 Carried Interest Distributions Carried interest is distributed generally upon profitable disposition of an investment if at the time of distribution, cumulative returns of the fund exceed minimum return hurdles. Carried interest distributions are recognized in earnings net of clawback obligations, if any. The amount and timing of carried interest distributions received may vary substantially from period to period depending upon the occurrence and size of investments realized by our sponsored funds. 
 Investments Our investments, primarily in our sponsored funds as general partner affiliate, generate cash largely through capital appreciation upon liquidation, and interest income from our credit fund. 
 Asset Monetization 
 We intend to monetize and recycle capital from our non-core investments through opportunistic asset sales. Following monetization of a substantial portion of our holdings in the third quarter of 2024, remaining marketable equity securities available for future monetization totaled 6.4 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Public Offerings 
 We may offer and sell various types of securities from time to time at our discretion based upon our needs and depending upon market conditions and available pricing.

 Investing activities relate to general partner and general partner affiliate investments in sponsored funds, including drawdown of commitments and return of capital from realized fund investments; business combinations; and prior to deconsolidation of portfolio companies in the Operating segment in 2023, acquisition of real estate. 
 Our investing activities generated net cash outflows of 6.8 million in 2024 and 768.1 million in 2023. 
 Net cash outflows in 2024 were driven by 76.8 million of fundings for our general partner and general partner affiliate commitments in our sponsored funds, net of return of capital, largely offset by 35.0 million of net proceeds from sale of our non-core investments and 38.0 million of net inflows from the investing activities of our consolidated liquid funds which hold marketable equity securities. 
 The large net cash outflows in 2023 can be attributed to (i) real estate investing activities which generated net cash outflows of 613.1 million, attributable to capital expenditures in the data center portfolio of our former Operating segment; (ii) derecognition of 102.4 million of cash and restricted cash following the deconsolidation of a portfolio company in our former Operating segment, and (iii) 314.3 million paid, net of cash assumed, for the acquisition of InfraBridge. These outflows were partially offset by net cash inflows of 232.3 million from equity investments, largely representing 201.6 million proceeds from the sale of BRSP shares, return of capital from a non-digital equity investment following a final sale of its underlying assets, and investing activities of our consolidated liquid funds which hold marketable equity securities, partially offset by funding of our general partner and general partner affiliate commitments, net of return of capital. 
 Financing Activities 
 We may draw upon our securitized financing facility to finance our operating activities, and have the ability to raise capital in the public markets through issuances of preferred stock, common stock and private placement notes. We incur cash outlays primarily for payments on our corporate debt, and dividends to our preferred stockholders and common stockholders. Prior to deconsolidation in 2023, portfolio companies in the former Operating segment financed their activities largely through investment-level secured debt and incurred cash outlays for debt servicing and distributions to their third party investors who represented noncontrolling interests. 
 Financing activities generated net cash outflows in 2024 and inflows in 2023. 
 In 2024, net cash outflows of 77.8 million were driven by preferred dividend payments of 44.0 million, cash settlement of contingent consideration to Wafra of 17.5 million, and limited partner redemptions in our consolidated liquid funds, partially offset by syndication of our interest in a consolidated fund and funding by Wafra for its share of our general partner commitment in DBP I. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash inflows of 78.6 million in 2023 represent primarily 489.9 million of additional investment-level debt in the former Operating segment, largely offset by the full repayment of our 200 million 5.00 convertible senior notes, 90 million contingent consideration payment to Wafra, 73.5 million redemption by a limited partner in a consolidated liquid fund, and income distribution to noncontrolling interests in our former Operating segment. 
 Guarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe are reasonable likely to have a material effect on our financial condition. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and 
 assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are integral to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results as they require subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies or those of our unconsolidated joint ventures since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 With respect to all critical estimates, we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments applied were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. Due to the inherently judgmental nature of the various projections and assumptions used, and unpredictability of economic and market conditions, actual results may differ from estimates, and changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements in the future. 
 Recent Accounting Updates 
 The effects of accounting standards adopted in 2024 and the potential effects of accounting standards to be adopted in the future are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of financial loss from adverse movement in market prices. The primary sources of market risk are interest rates, foreign currency rates, equity prices and commodity prices. 
 Our business is exposed primarily to the effect of market risk on our fee revenue, principal investment income and net carried interest allocation, foreign currency risk on non-U.S. investment management business and foreign denominated warehoused investments (if any), interest rate risk on our VFN and other variable rate debt financing warehoused investments (if any), and, equity price risk on marketable equity securities, held primarily by consolidated investment vehicles. 
 Market Risk Effect on Fee Revenue, Principal Investment Income and Net Carried Interest Allocation 
 Management Fees To the extent management fees are based upon fair value of the underlying investments of our managed investment vehicles, an increase or decrease in fair value will directly affect our management fee revenue. Generally, our management fee revenue is calculated based upon investors' committed capital during the commitment period of the vehicle, and thereafter, contributed or invested capital during the investing and liquidating periods, or invested capital from inception for Credit and co-investment vehicles. To a lesser extent, management fees are based upon the NAV of vehicles in our Liquid Strategies or GAV for certain InfraBridge vehicles, measured at fair value. At September 30, 2024, vehicles with NAV or GAV fee basis made up 5 of our 34.1 billion FEEUM. Accordingly, most of our management fee revenue will not be directly affected by changes in investment fair values. 
 Principal Investment Income (Loss) This is our share of income (loss) from equity interests in our sponsored funds, which in turn is largely driven by fair value changes in the underlying investments of the funds. 
 A hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of fund investments at September 30, 2024 would decrease the OP's share of principal investment income by approximately 124 million. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 Incentive Fees and Carried Interest Incentive fees and carried interest, net of management allocations, are earned based upon the financial performance of a vehicle above a specified return threshold, which is largely driven by appreciation in value of underlying investments. The amount of carried interest allocation recognized is based upon the cumulative performance of the fund if it were liquidated as of the reporting date. Carried interest is subject to reversal until such time it is distributed. The extent of the effect of fair value changes to the amount of incentive fees and carried interest earned will depend upon the cumulative performance of an investment vehicle relative to its return threshold, the performance measurement period used to calculate incentives and carried interest, and the stage of the vehicle's lifecycle. 
 A hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of fund investments at September 30, 2024 would decrease carried interest by approximately 168 million, representing the OP's share of carried interest net of allocations to employees, former employees and Wafra. In the same scenario, generally no incentive fees would be realized. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have limited direct foreign currency exposure from our foreign operations and foreign currency denominated investments warehoused on the balance sheet for future sponsored vehicles. Changes in foreign currency rates can adversely affect earnings and the value of our foreign currency denominated investments, including investments in our foreign subsidiaries. 
 We have exposure to foreign currency risk from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent these subsidiaries do not transact in U.S. dollars. Generally, this is limited to our InfraBridge advisor subsidiary which receives fee revenue predominantly in U.S. dollars but incur operating costs in Pound Sterling. 
 We may have foreign currency denominated investments held by our U.S. subsidiaries that are temporarily warehoused on the balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, our foreign currency exposure is limited to only one AUD equity investment (cost of investment at AUD 35 million). Based upon book value of the investment (which is lower than cost), a hypothetical 100 basis point decline in the AUD/USD rate at September 30, 2024 would have an immaterial effect on earnings. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Instruments bearing variable interest rates include debt obligations, which are subject to interest rate fluctuations that will affect future cash flows, specifically interest expense. 
 Our corporate debt exposure to variable interest rates is limited to our VFN revolver, which had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 91 million of long positions and 47 million of short positions in marketable equity securities, held predominantly by our consolidated sponsored liquid funds. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from marketable equity securities are recorded in other gain (loss) on the consolidated statement of operations. Market prices for publicly traded equity securities may fluctuate due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to, financial performance of the investee, industry conditions, economic and political environment, trade volume, and general sentiments in the equity markets. Therefore the level of volatility and price fluctuations are unpredictable. Our funds constantly rebalance their investment portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities and to manage risk. Additionally, one of our funds employs a long/short equity strategy, taking long positions that serve as collateral for short positions, which in combination, reduces its market risk exposure. The effect of equity price decreases to earnings attributable to our stockholders is further reduced as our consolidated liquid funds are partially owned by third party capital, which represent redeemable noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and 
 59

 procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
