million committed revolving credit agreement maturing in August 2026 with Bank of America, N.A. and the other lenders named therein (the "Credit Agreement"), which included a combined letter of credit sub-facility of up to million, a U.S. swing-line loan facility of up to million, and a Canadian swing-line loan facility of up to million. The Credit Agreement included a million sublimit (in U.S. or Canadian dollars) available for borrowings by Graybar Canada. Our borrowing availability under the facility is reduced by the amount of borrowings by Graybar Canada, but we may use the sublimit amount to increase our borrowings, to the extent available. If we were to use available borrowings under the Credit Agreement that included the sublimit amount, then Graybar Canada s available capacity would be reduced by our use of such amount. The Credit Agreement contained an accordion feature, which allowed us to request increases in the aggregate borrowing commitments of up to million. On June 26, 2024, we, along with Graybar Canada, amended the Credit Agreement, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a CDOR transition amendment (the CDOR Amendment ), by and among Graybar, as parent borrower, Graybar Canada Limited, as a borrower, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A. as Domestic Administrative Agent, Domestic Swing Line Lender and Domestic L/C Issuer and Bank of America, N.A., acting through its Canada Branch, as Canadian Administrative Agent, Canadian Swing Line Lender and Canadian L/C Issuer. The CDOR Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, change the interest rate under the Credit Agreement for borrowings denominated in Canadian Dollars from a CDOR-based rate to a rate based on Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), subject to the adjustments specified in the Credit Agreement. Our borrowing availability remains unchanged under the revised Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ). Interest on our borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement will be based on, at the borrower s election, either (A) (i) the base rate (as defined in the agreement) or (ii) term SOFR (as defined in the agreement, in the case of U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings) or (B) (i) the base rate or (ii) term CORRA (as defined in the agreement, in the case of Graybar Canada as borrower with respect to Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings), in each case plus an applicable rate, as determined by the pricing grid set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. In connection with such a borrowing, the applicable borrower will also select the term of the loan from available tenors, up to six months, or automatically renew with the consent of the lenders. Swing line loans, which are daily loans, will bear interest at a rate based on, at the borrower s election, either (i) the base rate or (ii) term SOFR (or term CORRA, in the case of Graybar Canada with respect to Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings). In addition to interest payments, there are certain fees and obligations associated with borrowings, swing-line loans, letters of credit and other administrative matters. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement and Credit Agreement, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had total debt of million, of which million was long-term debt. At December 31, 2023, we had total debt of million, of which million was long-term debt. There were short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Short-term borrowings outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ranged from short-term borrowings to a maximum of million. Short-term borrowings outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 ranged from short-term borrowings to a maximum of million.

These covenants are substantially similar to those contained in the Amended Credit Agreement, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable shelf agreement. All outstanding obligations of Graybar under one or both of these agreements may be declared immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of an event of default.

The Pension Plan provides retirement benefits based on an employee s final average earnings and years of service. A supplemental benefit plan provides nonqualified pension benefits for compensation in excess of the IRS compensation limits applicable to the Pension Plan and eligible compensation deferred by a participant. Our funding policy is to make contributions to the Pension Plan, provided that the total annual contributions will not be less than the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 minimums or greater than the maximum tax-deductible amount, to review the contribution and funding strategy on a regular basis, and to allow discretionary contributions to be made by us from time to time. The assets of the Pension Plan are invested primarily in fixed income investments and equity securities. We pay nonqualified pension benefits when they are due according to the terms of the supplemental benefit plan. We have an employee deferred compensation trust to meet funding obligations for nonqualified pension benefits to certain participants in the supplemental benefit plan. The assets of the employee deferred compensation trust are invested in highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. We provide certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees. Substantially all of our employees hired or rehired prior to 2014 may become eligible for postretirement medical benefits if they reach the age and service requirements of the retiree medical plan and retire on a pension (except a deferred pension) under the Pension Plan.

The results shown herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods. Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA ), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Income from operations decreased 11.6 million, or 7.1 , to 151.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 162.9 million for the same three-month period last year. The increase in gross margin was less than the increase in SG A expenses, resulting in a decrease in net income attributable to Graybar for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 7.5 million, or 6.4 , to 110.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 117.7 million for the same three-month period last year.

Gross margin rate was 19.9 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income attributable to Graybar for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 325.8 million, a decrease of 40.9 million, or 11.2 , from net income attributable to Graybar of 366.7 million for the same nine-month period last year. We continue to see demand for our products and services, even as the markets we serve are affected by ongoing skilled labor shortages, rising costs and economic uncertainty. As we invest in our long-term growth and Graybar Connect, we remain focused on serving our customers, managing our business wisely, and pursuing opportunities to strengthen our industry leadership position.

Gross margin increased 28.3 million, or 5.0 , to 597.2 million from 568.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. Our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 20.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up from 19.9 for the same three-month period in 2023. SG A expenses increased 37.2 million, or 9.5 , to 426.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 389.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher compensation costs, and an increase in IT expenses and consulting fees associated with Graybar Connect. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up from 13.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.2 million, or 12.2 , to 20.2 million from 18.0 million, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher amortization expense of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions and an increase in property, at cost. Income before provision for income taxes totaled 150.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9.7 million, or 6.1 , from 160.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to our increase in SG A expenses, partially offset by our increase in gross margin. Our total provision for income taxes decreased 2.1 million, or 5.0 , to 40.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42.1 million for the same period of 2023. This decrease in our provision for income taxes was due to lower pretax income. Our effective tax rate was 26.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.3 for the same period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the 21.0 U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state, local and foreign income taxes. Net income attributable to Graybar Electric Company, Inc. for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 7.5 million, or 6.4 , to 110.2 million from 117.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Gross margin increased 54.3 million, or 3.2 , to 1,731.0 million from 1,676.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. Our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 19.9 for the nine 

 19 

months ended September 30, 2024, down from 20.2 for the same nine-month period in 2023 primarily due to competitive pricing pressures. SG A expenses increased 108.9 million, or 9.7 , to 1,235.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,126.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to higher compensation costs, as well as an increase in IT expenses and consulting fees associated with Graybar Connect. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 13.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 12.3 million, or 25.8 , to 59.9 million from 47.6 million for the same nine-month period in 2023 primarily due to higher amortization expense of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions and an increase in property, at cost. Other income, net totaled 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other income, net consists primarily of gains or losses on the disposal of property, trade receivable interest charges to customers, and other miscellaneous income items related to our business activities. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to a 6.5 million gain on the sale of property, which had been previously classified as an asset held for sale, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Income before provision for income taxes totaled 441.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 56.0 million, or 11.3 , from 497.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our increase in SG A expenses, partially offset by our increase in gross margin. Our total provision for income taxes decreased 15.1 million, or 11.7 , to 114.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 129.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our provision for income taxes year over year resulted from decreased pretax income. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 26.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.1 for 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the 21.0 U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state, local, and foreign income taxes. Net income attributable to Graybar Electric Company, Inc. for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 40.9 million, or 11.2 , to 325.8 million from 366.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Financial Condition and Liquidity We manage our liquidity and capital levels so that we have the capability to invest in the growth of our business, meet debt service obligations, fund acquisitions, finance anticipated capital expenditures, finance information technology needs, pay dividends, make benefit payments, and finance other miscellaneous cash outlays. We believe that maintaining a strong company financial condition enables us to competitively access multiple financing channels and invest in strategic long-term growth plans. We have historically funded our working capital requirements using cash flows generated from the collection of trade receivables and trade accounts payable terms with our suppliers, supplemented by short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility, if necessary. Acquisitions and capital expenditures have been financed primarily with cash from working capital management and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were 202.4 million, compared to 98.6 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 103.8 million. The increase in cash on hand at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 is reflective of strong cash flows from operating activities as a result of effective working capital management. As a result, we had no short-term borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Current assets exceeded current liabilities by 1,172.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 152.0 million, or 14.9 , from 1,020.6 million at December 31, 2023. Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 304.2 million, compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of 416.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 112.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to net income of 326.6 million, adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of 59.9 million, and an increase in trade accounts payable of 112.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables of 133.4 million and a decrease in non-current liabilities of 62.5 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 

 20 

The average number of days of sales in trade receivables for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 improved moderately compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The days in inventory improved significantly for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities totaled 171.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used by investing activities of 463.1 million for the same nine-month period in 2023, a decrease of 292.0 million. Cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of amounts attributable to acquisitions of 146.3 million and capital expenditures of 37.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of property of 13.7 million. Cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of amounts attributable to acquisitions of 380.2 million, capital expenditures of 58.7 million, and an investment in an employee deferred compensation trust of 25.0 million. Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 29.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no net change in short-term borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net increase in short-term borrowings of 70.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash dividends paid were 29.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were 202.4 million, compared to 98.6 million at December 31, 2023. We also had a 750.0 million unsecured, committed revolving credit facility Amended Credit Agreement with 744.7 million in available capacity at September 30, 2024, compared to available capacity of 746.4 million at December 31, 2023 under the Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had two uncommitted, unsecured private placement shelf agreements ("Shelf Agreements"). One of the Shelf Agreements is expected to allow us to issue senior promissory notes up to 200.0 million to PGIM, Inc. at fixed rate terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three-year issuance period ending in August 2026. Our other Shelf Agreement is expected to allow us to issue senior promissory notes to MetLife Investment Management, LLC, and MetLife Investment Management Limited (collectively, MetLife and each other MetLife affiliate that becomes party to the agreement at fixed or floating rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three-year issuance period. On June 25, 2024, we amended the MetLife Shelf Agreement to, among other things, increase availability from 150.0 million to 200.0 million, and extend the issuance period to June 2027, and thereafter, for successive three-year periods until either party notifies the other party at least 30 days prior to the then applicable stated period end date of its intent not to extend. We have not issued any notes under the Shelf Agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For further discussion related to our Amended Credit Agreement and our Shelf Agreements, refer to Note 5, "Debt", of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements located in Item 1., Financial Statements , of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We had total letters of credit of 11.1 million outstanding at September 30, 2024, of which 5.3 million were issued under the Amended Credit Agreement. We had total letters of credit of 9.4 million at December 31, 2023, of which 3.6 million were issued under the Credit Agreement. The letters of credit are issued primarily to support certain workers' compensation insurance policies and support performance under certain customer contracts. New Accounting Standards Updates Our adoption of new accounting standards is discussed in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements located in Item 1., "Financial Statements", of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the policies, procedures, controls, or risk profile from those provided in Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed four acquisitions which operated under their own set of systems and internal controls. Management is in process of evaluating and integrating the internal controls of the acquired businesses during the first year of the business combination into our internal controls framework. (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Our common stock is 100 owned by active and retired employees, and there is no public trading market for our common stock. Since 1928, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock have been held of record by voting trustees under successive voting trust agreements. A new Voting Trust Agreement was established effective March 3, 2017, which expires by its terms on March 1, 2027, because under applicable New York law, a voting trust may not have a term greater than ten years. At September 30, 2024, approximately 83 of our outstanding common stock was held in the voting trust. The participation of shareholders in the voting trust is voluntary at the time the voting trust is created, but is irrevocable during its term. Shareholders who elect not to participate in the voting trust hold their common stock as shareholders of record. Shareholders may elect to participate in the voting trust at any time during the term of the voting trust. No holder of our common stock or voting trust interests representing our common stock ("common stock", "common shares", or "shares") may sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any shares without first offering us the option to purchase those shares at the price at which they were issued. We also have the option to purchase at the issue price the common shares of any shareholder who ceases to be an employee for any cause other than death or "retirement" (as defined in our amended restated certificate of incorporation), and on the first anniversary of any holder's death. In the past, we have always exercised these purchase options, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. However, we can make no assurance that we will continue to exercise our purchase option in the future. All outstanding shares have been issued at 20.00 per share. The following table sets forth information regarding purchases of common stock by the Company, all of which were made pursuant to the foregoing provisions: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs July 1 - July 31, 2024 38,212 20.00 N/A August 1 - August 31, 2024 92,319 20.00 N/A September 1 - September 30, 2024 141,577 20.00 N/A Total 272,108 20.00 N/A 
 Item 5. Other Information. (c) None of the Company s directors or officers or a trading arrangement or a trading arrangement during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Such arrangements would not apply to the Company because no holder of our shares may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of our shares without first offering the Company the option to purchase those shares at the price at which they were issued.

(f) In the event that the corporation shall purchase any of the Common Stock upon exercising any of the aforesaid options, the corporation may purchase such stock in the name and for the account of any employee of the corporation or of a subsidiary corporation with funds provided by any such party, or at its option, if it has funds available for the purpose, the corporation may purchase the shares for its own account and deposit them in its treasury, and may resell from time to time any or all such shares purchased for its own account for such price or prices, and to such employee or employees of the corporation or of a subsidiary corporation as the board of directors may determine, or at the option of the board of directors, any or all of such shares may be retired or cancelled in any manner permitted by law. 

(g) Subject to all of the rights of the Preferred Stock, dividends may be paid upon the Common Stock if and when declared by the board of directors out of any funds of the corporation legally available therefor. 

(h) Except as otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation as amended or in the terms of any series of Preferred Stock as fixed by the board of directors as provided herein, the holders of the Common Stock shall have exclusive voting power for the election of directors and upon all other matters that may be submitted to the stockholders for their vote or consent. 

C. No holder of Common Stock shall hypothecate or pledge any Common Stock except under an agreement of hypothecation or pledge with the pledgee containing the following provisions together in the following sequence: 

"In the event of the death of the pledgor or in the event that he ceases to be an employee of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. or of a subsidiary corporation for any cause other than death or Retirement, Graybar Electric Company, Inc. shall have the same right to purchase any or all of the pledged stock as it would have had if the stock had not been pledged, and may make payment therefor to the pledgee or any party presenting the certificates therefor, properly endorsed for transfer. The provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation relating to the rights of the corporation to such stock and the price to be paid therefor are set forth on the back of the stock certificates pledged and the pledgee has notice thereof. 

"In the event that the pledgor shall be in default under the pledge, Graybar Electric Company, Inc. shall have an option, good until the expiration of thirty (30) days from the time written notice of such default is served upon said corporation by the pledgee, to take over the stock pledged and the debt to secure which such stock has been pledged, upon payment to the pledgee of the amount then owing on said debt, and no sale shall be made by the pledgee under said pledge until such option has expired. 

"In the event that the pledgor shall be in default under the pledge and the amount then owing on the debt shall exceed the price at which Graybar Electric Company, Inc. would be entitled to purchase stock under option given to it in case the pledgor should desire to sell same, said corporation shall have the right, good until the expiration of thirty (30) days from the time written notice is served upon said corporation by the pledgee, to redeem or purchase such stock, at said option price, and may make payment therefor to the pledgee or any party presenting the certificates therefor properly endorsed for transfer, and no sale shall be made by the pledgee until such option has expired. 

"No other provisions in the hypothecation or pledge shall in any way affect the rights given in the three preceding paragraphs, and by accepting the pledge the pledgee agrees to carry out and be bound by the provisions of the three preceding paragraphs and of the certificate of incorporation as amended of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. 

"Any right or option in the corporation to purchase, redeem, take over or otherwise acquire any stock of the corporation shall, in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation as amended, also accrue to and may be exercised by any person, persons, firm or corporation designated by the corporation to purchase or acquire such stock or any part thereof. 

"It is understood that the certificate of incorporation of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. also provides, in substance, that if any party shall claim or establish ownership of or any interest in shares of stock of the corporation and if such ownership or interest is the result of a sale or transfer in breach of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, such shares or interest shall at the option of the corporation be subject at all times to purchase by said corporation at prices and under terms and conditions set forth in or to be determined as provided in said certificate of incorporation." 

In the event that the corporation shall have exercised any such option to take over any stock which shall have been pledged or hypothecated and the debt to secure which such stock has been pledged, the corporation shall have the right, at any time after the expiration of thirty (30) days after written notice mailed to the holder of record of the pledged stock at his address as shown on the books of the corporation, to purchase said stock by paying or tendering to the pledgor the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the corporation to the pledgee in taking over said stock, together with interest to the time of such purchase, and the price which the corporation would be required to pay to purchase said stock in case of sale by the stockholder to the corporation under the provisions of paragraph (a) of Section B; provided, however, that at any time prior to such purchase of said stock by the corporation the pledgor may redeem said stock from the corporation by paying to the corporation the amount which the corporation paid to the pledgee in taking over the said stock, together with interest thereon. All such interest shall be computed at the rate of six per cent (6 per annum. In the event that the corporation shall have exercised its option to take over any stock which shall have been pledged or hypothecated, and the debt to secure which the stock has been pledged, the corporation shall, in addition to any rights herein granted, be subrogated to all the rights of the pledgee of said stock. No pledge or hypothecation of any stock of the corporation, except in accordance with the foregoing conditions, shall in any way affect the right of the corporation to treat the stock as if it had not been pledged, whether in the hands of the pledgee or any subsequent holder whose title is through the pledgee or through any sale or transfer resulting from the pledge. 

D. All certificates of Common Stock of the corporation shall contain or have endorsed thereon the provisions of the certificate of incorporation as amended in respect of the sale, transfer and pledge of stock, and all voting trust certificates or other certificates of interest covering stock of the corporation issued under a voting trust agreement or other agreement to which the corporation may be a party shall likewise contain or have endorsed thereon said provisions. No transfers of stock shall be recorded on the books of the corporation unless effected in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation as amended. Each holder of a certificate of stock of the corporation shall be charged with notice of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of the corporation as amended and shall by receiving any such stock certificate be deemed to assent to and be bound by all of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation as amended. 

If for any reason whatsoever any party to whom a sale or transfer has been made in breach of any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation as amended should claim or establish ownership of or any interest in any shares of stock of the corporation, such shares shall thereupon become subject to redemption or purchase at any and all times thereafter at the option of the corporation, whether in the hands of such party or any subsequent transferee, immediate or remote, upon mailing thirty (30) days notice of the election of the corporation to redeem or purchase such shares to the then holder of record at its address as it appears upon the stock books of the corporation or the books of the voting or other trustees at the price provided in paragraph (a) of Section B hereof, and the corporation may redeem or purchase any such shares upon paying the price specified. 

The corporation shall withhold any dividends and refuse to permit the exercise of any voting right upon any shares transferred in violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation as amended or in regard to which there has been any default in notifying the corporation of the stockholder's desire to sell his stock in order to give the corporation opportunity to exercise its option to purchase, or default in delivery of stock after the corporation has given notice of its election to exercise any option to purchase. Whenever herein the corporation shall be given any right or option to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of the corporation in any manner whatsoever, such rights shall also accrue and may be exercised by any person, persons, firm or corporation designated by the corporation to purchase or acquire such stock or any part thereof. 

If any one or more provisions of Section A, B or C or of this Section D shall be declared to be invalid, it shall not affect the validity of any other provisions of said sections or this section or of the certificate of incorporation as amended, nor shall the fact that any shares of the corporation shall be held at any time by any party not entitled to hold the same or from whom the corporation might purchase the same under the provisions of this Section D relieve any other stockholder from compliance with the terms of the provisions of Sections A, B and C and of this Section D. 

The term "employee" as used in Sections B and C shall be deemed to include salaried officers. 

The term "subsidiary" or "subsidiary company" as used in the certificate of incorporation as amended shall be deemed to mean any company seventy-five per cent (75 of whose outstanding shares of equity stock, as hereinafter defined, shall be owned by the corporation or by another subsidiary. The term "equity stock" as herein used means the outstanding class or classes of shares entitled upon liquidation of a company to the final distribution of all assets remaining after the payment and discharge of all obligations and after payment and distribution to all classes of shares entitled to priority on the distribution of assets. 

E. No stockholder of any class of the corporation shall as such be entitled as of right to purchase or subscribe for stock of any class of the corporation, whether authorized by this certificate of incorporation or by any amendment to this certificate of incorporation or to purchase or subscribe for any other securities of the corporation whether or not such securities may be convertible into stock of any class of the corporation. 

FIFTH: No stockholder shall be entitled as of right to purchase or subscribe for any part of any unissued stock or of any additional stock to be issued by reason of any increase of the authorized capital stock of the corporation or of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, debentures or other securities convertible into stock of the corporation, but any such unissued stock or such additional authorized issue of new stock or of other securities convertible into stock may be issued and disposed of pursuant to resolution of the board of directors to such persons, firms, corporations or associations and upon such terms as may be deemed advisable by the board of directors in the exercise of their discretion. 

SIXTH: The Secretary of State of New York is hereby designated as the agent of the corporation upon whom process in any action or proceeding against the corporation may be served. The principal office of the corporation in the State of New York is located in the City, County and State of New York, and the address to which the Secretary of State shall mail a copy of process in any action or proceeding against the corporation which may be served upon him is c/o Corporation Service Company, 80 State Street , Albany , New York 1 2207-2543 .

No amendment to or repeal of this Article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

Exhibit 10 

G. I. 16.3 

(Effective January 1, 2025 

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN 

1. GENERAL 

1.1. The purpose of the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) is to focus management attention on the planning and execution of activities that are critical to Graybar's success and to reward individuals and units that contribute to improved corporate performance. 

1.2. The manner in which MIP is determined and distributed to participants is set forth in this Instruction. 

1.3. This plan shall be referred to as the Management Incentive Plan or MIP; however, since it covers Corporate, district and branch participants, it may be helpful to refer to the Corporate, district or branch incentive portion of the plan when discussing specific units or report measurements. 

2. PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN 

2.1. Employees who are in positions that have MIP Guideline Incentives (as defined in the Company compensation structure) are eligible to participate in the plan and to receive an annual Incentive Award payment, with the following exceptions and limitations: 

2.1.1. To qualify for an Incentive Award for any calendar year, the employee must remain in the service of the Company through the last business day of December of that calendar year. If an employee terminates before the last business day of December, that employee will forfeit his/her MIP payment for that year. Payment of the employee's salary through the last day of employment with the Company fully discharges the Company's obligation with respect to compensation. Exceptions will be made in the event of death or Retirement (as defined in the amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company). 

2.1.2. An employee on an unpaid leave of absence will cease to be a participant during the leave. An employee who returns from the leave to an eligible position outlined in paragraph 2.1 above will continue participation upon their return. Applicable legal regulations and requirements will be followed. 

2.1.3. An employee who ceases to be a participant because of demotion or unpaid leaves of absence during the calendar year will have no claim to an Incentive Award, except for the period of active participation during the incentive year, or as granted in accordance with paragraph 2.1.2 above. 

2.1.4. Participants in MIP are eligible to earn an Incentive Award beginning with the first day of assignment. 

2.1.4.1. Employees who participate in MIP and whose job/position assignment changes will continue participation in their former position through the last day of assignment and begin MIP participation in the new position on the first day of reassignment. 

2.1.5. In cases of death or Retirement, MIP will be based on eligible compensation earned prior to the effective date of the applicable event. 

3. DETERMINATION OF INCENTIVE AWARDS 

3.1. Each member's Guideline Incentive will be expressed in dollars computed by multiplying the member's guideline percentage (indicated in the Company compensation structure) by the member's eligible annual base salary earnings for the incentive year. MIP employees receiving overtime will have MIP based on eligible base pay and overtime earnings. Actual incentives paid may vary from Guideline Incentive amounts based on the performance of the branch, district, or corporation. 

3.2. Incentive Awards described in Section 5 will be based on individual guideline incentives and the performance of the employee's organizational unit. For branch participants, the organizational unit will be the branch including its sub-branch(es) or branch group. Branch, district, and Corporate participants will be compensated under the Management Incentive Plan as outlined in the following paragraphs. 

3.3. Participants having responsibility in more than one district or branch will have their Guideline Incentive allocated to districts or branches based on either budgeted sales or as directed by the District Vice President or appropriate Senior Vice President. (See paragraph 5.5 .) 

3.4. Upon the recommendation of the District Vice President and approval by their Senior Vice President and General Manager and the President, certain expenses related to specific customer market expansion may be adjusted from a location's actual net profit when making incentive award calculations. 

3.4.1. Such expenses shall be submitted in writing by the District Vice President to their Senior Vice President and General Manager along with the market expansion plan for the applicable location. 

3.4.2. No expenditure to be considered for adjustment shall be made by the district until the plan has been approved by their Senior Vice President and General Manager and the President. 

3.4.3. Expenses eligible for adjustment shall be limited to the current year. Expenses associated with multi-year initiatives are reviewed and approved annually by their Senior Vice President and General Manager for the current year. 

3.4.4. The Manager Accounting Financial Analysis shall keep complete details of eligible expenses and submit them to the Controller with a copy to the Senior Vice President and General Manager as part of the year-end closing work. The Company reserves the right to reject any or all expenses submitted by the district if it is determined by the Senior Vice President and General Manager that the district has failed to adequately implement the approved market expansion plan(s). 

3.4.5 . The amount of the MIP adjustment shall be limited to the total amount approved. 

3.4.6 . After review by the Controller, details outlining the adjustment shall be forwarded to the Employee Resources Center for adjustment to the applicable location's actual net profit for MIP calculation purposes. Approved adjustments may be included in branch, district, and Corporate MIP calculations. 

3.5 . Upon the recommendation of the District Vice President and approval by their Senior Vice President and General Manager and the President, net profits for Districts opening a new branch(es) may be adjusted to exclude the net profits of the new branch house(s) if they have an adverse effect on MIP awards. 

4. FINAL PERFORMANCE INDEX FOR NET PROFIT, GROSS MARGIN, AND SALES PERFORMANCE 

4.1. For all participants, the Final Performance Index shall be calculated as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors (see G. I. 16.3 Supplement 1 ), provided that such calculations are communicated in accordance with Section 8 when applicable. 

5 . DETERMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS 

5.1 . Corporate 

5.1.1 . Awards to Corporate participants will be based on their Guideline Incentive (eligible salary multiplied by the applicable guideline percentage) multiplied by the Corporate Final Performance Index. The Corporate Final Performance Index shall be based on the consolidated financial performance of the Company including Graybar Corporate, districts, zones and all subsidiaries as determined from time to time in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Board. 

5.2. District 

5.2.1. Awards to district participants will be based on their Guideline Incentive (eligible salary multiplied by guideline percentage) multiplied by the Final Performance Index for their respective district(s). 

5.3 . Branch 

5.3.1. Awards to branch participants will be based on their Guideline Incentive (eligible salary multiplied by guideline percentage) multiplied by the Branch Final Performance Index for their respective branch(es). MIP eligible earnings include overtime for MIP participants who receive overtime. 

5.4 . Participants who transfer between districts will be paid the greater of the actual MIP earned or the MIP that would have been earned had they remained in the old unit for the entire year . 

5.5. In exceptional circumstances a participant may receive a guaranteed MIP for the year, upon recommendation to and pre-approval by the Senior Vice President HR. Such participant will receive the greater of their MIP guarantee or their incentive earned under the terms of the plan. In all cases, participants must meet eligibility requirements of the MIP for payment. 

5.6. A district or branch participant who has responsibility in more than one district or branch will have his/her Guideline Incentive allocated to the district or branch on the basis of either budgeted sales or as directed by the District Vice President or Senior Vice President and General Manager. (See paragraph 3.3 .) 

5.7. No participant will receive an award in excess of the maximum of applicable total points multiplied by his/her Guideline Incentive. 

5.8. Awards for each year, subject to the provisions of this Plan, will be paid between February 1 and March 15 of the following year. 

5.9. A District Vice President and a Senior Vice President and General Manager or appropriate Senior Vice President will approve all individual awards. The President will also approve all awards and may make any adjustments deemed appropriate. 

6. PRESIDENT'S DISCRETIONARY FUNDS 

6.1. The President will have an MIP Discretionary Fund equivalent to a set percentage of the total Guideline Incentives for all participants. 

6.2. The President shall annually request of each Senior Vice President and General Manager and the Senior Vice President recommendations for discretionary payments to any MIP participant or group of MIP participants. 

6.3. The Senior Vice President and General Manager or appropriate Senior Vice President may recommend discretionary payments to any participant or group of participants. Such awards shall not cause any individual to exceed the maximum of applicable total points multiplied by his/her Guideline Incentive. 

6.4 . The Senior Vice President and General Manager may recommend that a discretionary award, subject to limitations, be awarded to a Branch to cover unusual situations or exceptional performance. 

6.5 . It is not required that any or all Discretionary Funds be awarded. The total amount disbursed by the President will be reported to the Board of Directors. 

7 . MODIFICATION OF THE PLAN 

7.1 . The Company reserves the right to withdraw from this Plan, at any time, any line of merchandise that it sees fit for any reason. In case of the withdrawal of any line as provided for above, sales and profits will be adjusted to eliminate the line or lines of merchandise withdrawn and the adjusted sales and profits as approved by the Controller will be the sales and profits on which compensation will be based. 

7.2 . The Company reserves the right to establish different incentive targets for districts and branches that budget to produce negative or marginal net profit. Such special arrangements will be recommended by the Compensation Committee for approval by the President. Affected personnel will be notified in writing of the revised incentive targets by January 31 of the incentive year. 

7.3 . The awards as computed under this Plan will be reviewed by the appropriate District Vice President, Senior Vice President and General Manager and Senior Vice Presidents, who may recommend adjustments to the President. The President is authorized to make any adjustments necessary to correct distortions in unit or individual awards. 

7.4 . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan, the Company reserves the right to withdraw or to modify in whole or in part this Management Incentive Plan at any time. Notice of such modification or withdrawal would be given in writing to the employees covered by the Plan. 

8 . COMMUNICATION OF THE PLAN 

8.1 . District Vice Presidents will communicate this Plan to all employees who come under its provisions. As soon as the Plan has been read to or by an employee, the employee will sign a statement acknowledging that he/she fully understands the Management Incentive Plan and agrees to its provisions. Such statements will be signed on G. I. 16.3 Attachment A and will be retained in the District Vice President's files for review by Internal Auditors. 

8.2 . It is important that all participants fully understand both how their incentive pay is determined and how their performance can affect the performance of the unit. Whether understanding is achieved through group or individual meetings is at the discretion of the District Vice President. 

9 . TERM OF PLAN 

9.1 . This Plan supersedes and replaces all Management Incentive Plans previously issued. It will remain effective for each succeeding year until terminated. The procedure outlined in Section 8 above will be followed with the issuance of this Instruction and whenever a new member comes under its provisions. 

9.2 . Questions regarding interpretation or application of these instructions should be referred to the Senior Vice President-Human Resources. 

10 . 409A COMPLIANCE 

10.1 . This plan is intended to be exempt from the requirements of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the regulations promulgated there under ("Section 409A") to the maximum extent possible, whether pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) or otherwise. 

10.2. To the extent Section 409A is applicable to this plan, it is intended that this plan comply with the deferral, payout and other limitations, restrictions and requirements imposed under Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan to the contrary, with this plan will be interpreted, operated, and administrated in a manner consistent with such intentions. 

10.3. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and not withstanding any other provision of this plan to the contrary, with respect to any payment under this plan to which Section 409A applies, all references to this plan to the termination of an employee's employment or service are intended to mean the employee's "separation from service," within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). 

10.4. Not with standing anything contained herein to the contrary, if at the time of employee's termination date, (i) the employee is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A and , (ii) any of the payments of benefits provided here under may constitute "deferred compensation" under Section 409A, then, and only to the extent required by such provisions, the date of payment of such payments or benefits otherwise provided will be delayed for a period of up to six (6) months following the termination date.
