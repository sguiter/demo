Highlights 
 For the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, total case volume increased 3.8 and 4.4 , respectively, and independent restaurant case volume increased 4.1 and 4.8 , respectively. For the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024 , compared to the same period a year ago, total organic case volume increase d 1.1 and 1.5 , respectively, and organic independent restaurant case volume increased 2.4 and 2.8 , respectively. Net sales increased 622 million, o r 6.8 , and 1,725 million, or 6.5 for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024 , respectively, driven primarily by organic case volume growth, the impact of acquisitions and food cost inflation of 3.2 and 2.5 for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, respectively. 
 Gross profit increased 125 million, or 8.1 , to 1,667 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, and increased 310 million, or 6.8 , to 4,868 million for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024. For the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the increase was primarily a result of an increase in total case volume, improved cost of goods sold, pricing optimization and a favorable year-over-year LIFO adjustment. For the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the increase was primarily a result of an increase in organic case volume, improved cost of goods sold, the impact of acquisition and pricing optimization, partially offset by an unfavorable year-over-year LIFO adjustment. Gross profit was negatively impacted by LIFO expense of 23 million and 68 million for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, respectively. Gross profit was negatively impacted by a LIFO expense of 37 million and 42 million for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 17.1 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 16.9 for the prior year period and was 17.1 for both the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total operating expenses increased 76 million, or 5.8 , to 1,388 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, and increased 252 million, or 6.6 , to 4,071 million for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024. For the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the increase was primarily a result of an increase in total case volume and higher distribution costs, reflecting increased labor costs, partially offset by continued distribution productivity improvement as well as actions to streamline administrative processes and costs. For the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the increase was primarily a result of an increase in organic case volume, higher distribution costs, reflecting increased labor costs, the impact of acquisitions and incremental costs to serve our customers during January labor disruptions, partially offset by continued productivity improvement. 
 As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 14.3 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to 14.4 for the prior year period and was 14.3 for both the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 (1) EBITDA is defined as net income, plus interest expense net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for: (1) restructuring activity and asset impairment charges; (2) share-based compensation expense; (3) the impact of LIFO reserve adjustments; (4) loss on extinguishment of debt; (5) business transformation costs; and (6) other gains, losses, or costs as specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net sales. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income excluding the items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA listed above and further adjusted for the tax effect of the exclusions and discrete tax items. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income as presented are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are not measurements of our performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For additional information, see the discussion under the caption Non-GAAP Reconciliations below. 
 (2) Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of property and equipment less cash capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow as presented is a supplemental measure of our liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. It is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities or any other liquidity measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For additional information, see the discussion under the caption Non-GAAP Reconciliations below.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 We provide EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow as supplemental measures to GAAP financial measures regarding our operating performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures, as defined above, exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. 
 We believe that Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure of operating performance for both management and investors because it excludes items that are not reflective of our core operating performance and provides an additional view of our operating performance including depreciation, interest expense and income taxes on a consistent basis from period to period. We believe that Adjusted Net Income may be used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to facilitate period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity as to how factors and trends impact our operating performance. 
 Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures (1) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors as they assist in highlighting trends, (2) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (3) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (4) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures, and (5) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used in connection with certain covenants and activity restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness. We also believe these and similar non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Net Income are not measurements of our performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. 
 We use Free Cash Flow as a supplemental measure to GAAP financial measures regarding the liquidity of our operations. We measure Free Cash Flow as cash flows provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of property and equipment less cash capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities or any other liquidity measures derived in accordance with GAAP. 
 We caution readers that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Free Cash Flow may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies. Not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income or Free Cash Flow in the same manner. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by presenting the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.

 Comparison of Results 
 13 Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Highlights 
 Net sales increased 622 million, or 6.8 , to 9,728 million in 2024. 
 Total case volume increased 3.8 and independent restaurant case volume increased 4.1 . 
 Total organic case volum e increased 1.1 and organic independent restaurant case volume increased 2.4 . 
 Operating income increased 49 million, to 279 million in 2024. 
 Net income increased 53 million to 148 million in 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 53 million, or 13.2 , to 455 million in 2024. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 4.7 in 2024, compared to 4.4 in 2023. 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 622 million or 6.8 , to 9,728 million in 2024, driven by organic case volume growth, the impact of acquisitions and food cost inflation of 3.2 . Total case volume increased 3.8 driven by a 4.1 increase in independent restaurant case volume, a 5.7 increase in healthcare volume, a 3.0 increase in hospitality volume and a 2.4 increase in chain volume. Total organic case volume increased 1.1 and organic independent restaurant case volume increased 2.4 . Organic broadline sales of private brands represented approximately 35 of net sales in both 2024 and 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gros s profit increased 125 million, or 8.1 , to 1,667 million in 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in total case volume, improved cost of goods sold, pricing optimization and a favorable year-over-year LIFO adjustment. Our LIFO method of inventory costing resulted in an expense of 23 million in 2024 compared to an expense of 37 million i n 2023 , driven by inflation in poultry, cheese, and seafood. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 17.1 in 2024, due to the aforemention ed factors. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 16.9 in 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses, comprised of distribution, selling and administrative costs, increased 76 million, or 5.8 , to 1,388 million in 2024 . Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in total case volume and higher distribution costs, reflecting increased labor costs, partially offset by continued distribution productivity improvement as well as actions to streamline administrative processes and costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.3 in 2024, compared to 14.4 in 2023. 
 Operating Income 
 Our operating income was 279 million in 2024, compared to operating income of 230 million in 2023. The increase in operating income was due to the factors discussed in the relevant sections above. 
 Other Expense (Income) Net 
 Other expense (income) net includes components of net periodic pension benefit credits, exclusive of the service cost component associated with our defined benefit and other postretirement plans. We recognized other expense net of 3 million in 2024 and other income net of 1 million in 2023. The decrease in other income-net is due to an increase in the pension benefit interest cost and a decrease in the expected return on pension assets compared to 2023. 
 24 

Interest Expense Net 
 Interest expense net decreased 6 million to 75 million in 2024 primarily due to lower outstanding debt in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 
 For the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company s effective income tax rate of 26 differed from the 21 federal corporate income tax rate primarily as a result of state income taxes and the recognition of various discrete tax items. These discrete tax items included a tax benefit of 1 million related to a decrease in an unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions and a tax benefit of 1 million, primarily related to excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. For the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company s effective income tax rate of 27 differed from the 21 federal corporate income tax rate primarily as a result of state income taxes and the recognition of various discrete tax items. These discrete tax items were not material individually or in the aggregate. 
 Net Income 
 Our net income was 148 million in 2024, compared to a net income of 95 million in 2023. The improvement in net income was due to the relevant factors discussed above. 
 
 39 Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Highlights 
 Net sales increased 1,725 million, or 6.5 , to 28,386 million in 2024. 
 Total case volume increased 4.4 and independent restaurant case volume increased 4.8 . 
 Operating income increased 58 million, to 797 million in 2024. 
 Net income increased 69 million to 428 million in 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 129 million or 11.0 , to 1,300 million in 2024. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 4.6 in 2024, compared to 4.4 in 2023. 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased 1,725 million, or 6.5 , to 28,386 million in 2024 driven by organic case volume growth, the impact of acquisitions and food cost inflation of 2.5 . Total case volume increased 4.4 driven by a 4.8 increase in independent restaurant case volume, a 6.1 increase in healthcare volume, a 2.0 increase in hospitality volume and a 3.5 increase in chain volume. Organic broadline sales of private brands represented approximately 34 of net sales in both 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased 310 million, or 6.8 , to 4,868 million in 2024 primarily as a result of an increase in organic case volume, improved cost of goods sold, the impact of acquisitions and pricing optimization, partially offset by an unfavorable year-over-year LIFO adjustment. Our LIFO method of inventory costing resulted in an expense of 68 million in 2024, compared to expense of 42 million in 2023. LIFO expense in both periods is driven by a reduction in inventory values in multiple categories. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 17.1 in 2024 due to the aforementioned factors. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also 17.1 in 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses, comprised of distribution, selling and administrative costs, increased 252 million, or 6.6 , to 4,071 million in 2024. Operating expenses increased primarily due to an increase in organic case volume, higher distribution costs, reflecting increased labor costs, the impact of acquisitions and incremental costs to serve our customers during January labor disruptions, partially offset by continued productivity improvement. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.3 in both 2024 and 2023. 
 Operating Income 
 Our operating income was 797 million in 2024, compared to operating income of 739 million in 2023. The increase in operating income was due to the factors discussed in the relevant sections above. 
 25 

Other Expense (Income) Net 
 Other expense (income) net includes components of net periodic pension benefit credits, exclusive of the service cost component associated with our defined benefit and other postretirement plans. We recognized other expense net of 5 million in 2024 and other income net of 4 million in 2023. The decrease in other income-net is due to an increase in the pension benefit interest cost and a decrease in the expected return on pension assets compared to 2023. 
 Interest Expense Net 
 Interest expense net decreased 9 million to 235 million in 2024 primarily due to lower outstanding debt in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 
 For the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company s effective income tax rate of 23 differed from the 21 federal corporate income tax rate primarily as a result of state income taxes and the recognition of various discrete tax items. These discrete tax items included a tax benefit of 17 million, primarily related to a decrease in an unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions, a tax benefit of 8 million, primarily related to excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a tax expense of 3 million, primarily related to adjustments to prior year tax provision estimates. 
 
 For the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company s effective income tax rate of 25 differed from the 21 federal corporate income tax rate primarily as a result of state income taxes and the recognition of various discrete tax items. These discrete tax items included a tax benefit of 6 million, primarily related to excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a tax benefit of 4 million, primarily related to adjustments to prior year tax provision estimates. 
 Net Income 
 Our net income was 428 million in 2024, compared to a net income of 359 million in 2023. The improvement in net income was due to the relevant factors discussed above. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our ongoing operations and strategic objectives require working capital and continuing capital investment. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash provided by operations, as well as access to capital from bank borrowings and other types of debt and financing arrangements. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 1.7 billion in cash and available liquidity. 
 Indebtedness 
 The aggregate outstanding balance of our indebtedness was 4,789 million, net of 26 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 We had outstanding borrowings totaling 75 million and had issued letters of credit totaling 578 million under the ABL Facility as of September 28, 2024. There was remaining capacity of 1,647 million under the ABL Facility as of September 28, 2024. 
 The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility had an outstanding balance of 1,101 million, net of 8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 The 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility had an outstanding balance of 719 million, net of 2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 The Senior Notes due 2028 had an outstanding balance of 496 million, net of 4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 The Senior Notes due 2029 had an outstanding balance of 895 million, net of 5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 The Senior Notes due 2030 had an outstanding balance of 497 million, net of 3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 The Senior Notes due 2032 had an outstanding balance of 496 million, net of 4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of September 28, 2024. 
 We also had 502 million of obligations under financing leases for transportation equipment and building leases as of September 28, 2024. 
 26 

The ABL Facility will mature in 2027. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility will mature in 2026 and 2028, respectively. The Senior Notes due 2028, the Senior Notes due 2029, the Senior Notes due 2030 and the Senior Notes due 2032 will mature in 2028, 2029, 2030 and 2032, respectively. 
 The agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants. These include, among other things, covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on our assets, pay dividends, or engage in mergers or consolidations. The Company had approximately 2.3 billion of restricted payment capacity under these covenants and approximately 2.3 billion of its net assets were restricted after taking into consideration the net deferred tax assets and intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation as of September 28, 2024. 
 We believe that the combination of cash generated from operations, together with borrowing capacity under the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements, will be adequate to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. 
 Every quarter, we review rating agency changes for all of the lenders that have a continuing obligation to provide us with funding. We are not aware of any facts that indicate our lenders will not be able to comply with the contractual terms of their agreements with us. We continue to monitor the credit markets generally and the strength of our lender counterparties. 
 From time to time, we may repurchase or otherwise retire our debt and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our leverage. These actions may include open market repurchases, negotiated repurchases, and other retirements of outstanding debt. The amount of debt that may be repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, our debt trading levels, our cash position, and other considerations. Any potential debt reduction or other debt retirement could require significant use of our other available liquidity and capital resources. 
 See Note 10, Debt, in our consolidated financial statements, for a further description of our indebtedness. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents condensed highlights from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented: 
 39 Weeks Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income 428 359 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 95 188 Other adjustments 368 388 Net cash provided by operating activities 891 935 Net cash used in investing activities (447) (301) Net cash used in financing activities (632) (499) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (188) 135 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash beginning of period 269 211 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash end of period 81 346

 Investing Activities 
 During the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company completed the asset acquisition of IWC Food Service.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had 578 million of letters of credit outstanding primarily securing the Company s obligations with respect to its insurance program and certain real estate leases, under the ABL Facility as of September 28, 2024. 
 Except as disclosed above, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have prepared the financial information in this Quarterly Report in accordance with GAAP. Preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during these reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Annual Report includes a summary of the critical accounting policies we believe are the most important to aid in understanding our financial results. There have been no changes to those critical accounting policies that have had a material impact on our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses during the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and overall economic conditions. Our market risks include interest rate risk and fuel price risk. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 28 

Interest Rate Risk 
 Our debt exposes us to risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Floating rate debt, where the interest rate fluctuates periodically, exposes us to short-term changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt, where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument, exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates. We manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate hedges as a tool to achieve that position. In April 2023, the Company entered into two, two-year rate cap agreements, which will each mature on April 30, 2025 with a total notional amount of 450 million . The interest rate cap agreements will effectively cap the interest rate on approximately 25 of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facilities. The Company s maximum exposure to the variable component of the interest rate on the Term Loan Facilities will be 5 on the notional amount covered by the interest rate cap agreements. We may, in the future, enter into additional interest rate hedges, the risks of which include changes in the interest rates affecting the fai r value of such instruments, potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
 After considering interest rate caps that fixed the interest rate on a total notional amount of 450 million of the current principal amount of the Term Loan Facilities, approximately 31 of the principal amount of our debt bore interest at floating rates based on Term SOFR or an alternative reference rate, as defined in our credit agreements, as of September 28, 2024. A hypothetical 1 change in the applicable rate would cause the interest expense on our floating rate debt to change by approximately 16 million per year (see Note 10, Debt, in our consolidated financial statements). 
 Fuel Price Risk 
 We are also exposed to risk due to fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel. We require significant quantities of diesel fuel for our vehicle fleet, and the price and supply of diesel fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Increases in the cost of diesel fuel can negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending and increase the prices we pay for products, and the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers. 
 Fuel costs related to outbound deliveries approximated 191 million during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Our activities to minimize fuel cost risk include route optimization, improving fleet utilization, growing our fleet of electric vehicles and assessing fuel surcharges. We typically directly offset approximately 40 of the increases in fuel costs through fuel surcharges to customers. We also enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements. As of September 28, 2024, we had diesel fuel forward purchase commitments totaling 37 million, which lock approximately 26 of our projected diesel fuel purchase needs through December 2025. Using current published market price projections for diesel and estimated fuel consumption needs, a hypothetical 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price could result in approximately 15 million in addition al fuel cost on uncommitted volumes through December 2025. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that this information is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Share Repurchase Programs 
 On November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program Original Share Repurchase Program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 500 million of its outstanding common stock. On June 1, 2024, the Board approved, and on June 5, 2024, the Company announced, an increase in the amount of common stock that could be purchased under the Original Share Repurchase Program to 1 billion Amended Share Repurchase Program ). As of September 28, 2024, there was approximately 398 million in remaining funds authorized under the Amended Share Repurchase Program. For the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company repurchased 10,399,672 shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 580 million under the Amended Share Repurchase Program, inclusive of 6 million of excise taxes, fees and commissions.
